00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:47,641
Wait!

7
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,022
What?

8
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,528
My god!

9
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:24,635
A-ko! Time to go!

10
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,826
Akagiyama missiles!

11
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,732
Go! Go! A-ko!

12
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:55,176
B-ko, B-ko,
blow her up!

13
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,976
It's quiet today.

14
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:09,649
As Miss Ayumi gazed over the
tranquil schoolyard scene,

15
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:13,882
she was overcome with a
sense of helpless longing.

16
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:19,857
"I have a duty to my students,
but what of my duty to myself?"

17
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:25,890
The life of a beautiful woman
should be filled with joy.

18
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,333
Miss Ayumi, let me --

19
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,515
A-ko!

20
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:03,550
A-ko!

21
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,421
Hit her again,
hit her again!

22
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,700
You're finished, A-ko!

23
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,999
Prepare yourself!

24
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:29,467
A-ko!

25
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,674
A-ko!

26
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:42,182
A-ko!

27
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,759
Daily classroom cleanings are
essential for building discipline.

28
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:11,735
I understand.

29
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:15,637
Give them a good thrashing first,
then force them to clean up.

30
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:20,301
Yes. It builds
self-reliance.

31
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,607
Thank you, very much.

32
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,647
That was Miss Hazuki,
of the community college.

33
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,310
Next episode, we'll examine
Graviton Middle School,

34
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,354
and its innovative use
of corporal punishment.

35
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,951
Teacher!

36
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,193
According to the suicide
victim's friends,

37
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:46,919
she'd just lost her last chance at
marriage and was deeply depressed.

38
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,992
I've just felt so... tired.

39
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,265
That's not like you.

40
00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:02,795
It seems like everything I've done
turned out to be so meaningless.

41
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:11,277
Maybe I'll have
to get married.

42
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,758
You're finished, A-ko!

43
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:37,429
Really? Miss Ayumi's
getting married?

44
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:39,499
That's the rumor.

45
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:43,862
I heard that she's marrying
an old, fat, bald man.

46
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:47,030
I heard she's already
three months pregnant!

47
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:51,362
They've been lovers for years,
and have three children!

48
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:55,500
Next year, her eldest son
will be old enough to drink!

49
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:56,475
She can't!

50
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,306
How wonderful!

51
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:03,446
Marriage is so wonderful! There
must be someone out there for me.

52
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,710
Someone like Kei.

53
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:07,251
Kei?

54
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:08,784
Hey, A-ko...

55
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:11,820
"A-ko, I need you
to fulfill my life."

56
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,822
He'll whisper sweet
nothings in my ear.

57
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:16,391
Hey, A-ko!

58
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:18,322
Fool.

59
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:24,224
Your mentality is mired in medieval
morality. He dumped you, remember?

60
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,364
Pathetic.

61
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:31,834
Oh, yeah? He never even talked
to you, but you fell hard enough!

62
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:36,962
At least I had a date with him. We
rode his bike, and saw the harbor.

63
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:39,631
You saw the harbor.
Big deal.

64
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:41,497
Sunday --

65
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:46,044
Only an imbecile would waste
her life in dreams of marriage.

66
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,577
Marriage is just a tool to exploit
women and steal their freedom.

67
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:55,481
Don't worry, no one's going
to take YOUR freedom away!

68
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,485
No man is that desperate.

69
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,451
What do you
mean by that?

70
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:04,422
You don't want the truth. It would
be too painful for you to hear:

71
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:09,551
That you're a repulsive, ill-bred,
treacherous, vindictive idiot!

72
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:13,462
No man in the world would
ever want to marry you!

73
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:17,090
But I'm FAR too polite
to tell you that.

74
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,370
I didn't (well, I sort of did) mean it.

75
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,570
Die!

76
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,707
Akagiyama missiles!

77
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,521
They're at it again.

78
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,593
Akagiyama missiles!

79
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,759
A-ko ...

80
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,199
... is having so much fun.

81
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,311

83

84
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:05,132
C-ko, you saw,
didn't you?

85
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:11,645
Tell no one what
happened here.

86
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,991
It's one of their myths.

87
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:35,528
I agree.

88
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,462
No. It's a prophecy.

89
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,500
But, Professor,
it can't be --

90
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:46,196
The author is definitely
referring to the future.

91
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:54,431
In the days to come, our
goddess and queen will return.

92
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:58,444
Terror will rain from the sky,
and the stars will go black.

93
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,481
Everything that crawls on the
earth, all birds and animals,

94
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,481
every creature will die.

95
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,880
She will meet the
Gate of Stars.

96
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,748
And upon failing the
Test of Darkness,

97
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:13,254
she shall vanish,
and cease to be.

98
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:14,413
...or not to be.

99
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:18,424
For the road less traveled is
paved with good intentions,

100
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:20,892
from whose dark bourne
no traveler returns.

101
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:25,987
Ask not for whom the bell tolls,
it tolls for thee, Gunga Din.

102
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:29,032
Miss Ayumi, we
read that yesterday.

103
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:35,437
...far, far better thing
that Christmas morn,

104
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,438
for tomorrow is
another day.

105
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,733
Miss Ayumi!

106
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:55,615
Are you sure?

107
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:59,585
Absolutely, ma'am.
I saw it with my own eyes!

108
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:02,588
Your father was at
Miss Ayumi's apartment,

109
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,682
for approximately
48 minutes, 23 seconds.

110
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,388
48 minutes and 23 seconds.

111
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:13,595
Thank you.
That's all for today.

112
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:14,528
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:17,690
But then --
no, it can't be.

114
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,825
Wait, it could be possible.

115
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:32,105
"As I gaze at the moon,
The mountains look like kingdoms",

116
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:35,612
"And it reminds me of my love,
Far away."

117
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:39,011
Manyoshu,
book eleven.

118
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,649
B-ko.

119
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,480
Is that how you
feel, tonight?

120
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:53,648
I'm afraid I won't be the
one to win Miss Ayumi's hand.

121
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,658
A younger man
has that honor.

122
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,624
And your involvement?

123
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:00,093
I'm just a go-between.

124
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:04,565
I see. So what's
the boy like?

125
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:05,931
He's...

126
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:12,903
You liar! You liar!
You liar!

127
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:17,332
You're lying!

128
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:42,215
I'm so very hap-py to go
to see a movie with A-ko!

129
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:46,557
I'm very hap-py to say,
I'm going to see a movie today!

130
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:58,903
That's strange.
Come on, A-ko.

131
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:05,338
Daitokuji Gorgeous Hotel

132
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:11,610
So... do you have
any hobbies?

133
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:20,218
My son is so
quiet and shy,

134
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:25,745
even though he's going to
inherit the family business.

135
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:31,815
That's why I asked Mr. Daitokuji
to locate a wife for us.

136
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:37,659
The strong silent type!
Women appreciate a man like that!

137
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,734
A-ko, let's go.

138
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:57,910
Have you seen
any movies?

139
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,248
What kind of movies
do you like?

140
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:12,016
Could you speak
up a bit?

141
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,320
Deep Throat.

142
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:25,195
Yes, the critics raved.

143
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:37,300
We're gonna miss
the movie, A-ko.

144
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:40,237
Something terrible's
about to happen.

145
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:41,968
How do you know?

146
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,271
Woman's intuition.

147
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:58,952
Kei!

148
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:03,183
My Kei! No!

149
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:49,582
Hut! Hut! Hut!

150
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,153
Kei, are you okay?

151
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,122
Poor Kei, tragically
slain by A-ko.

152
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,163
It's YOUR fault!

153
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:04,459
A-ko! B-ko!

154
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:10,301
Save your fighting
for the classroom!

155
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:14,964
But Miss Ayumi, I was only trying
to save you from this farce!

156
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:17,472
Mind your own business!

157
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:21,171
Excuse me.

158
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:24,711
I accept your proposal.

159
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,246
I'd love to marry Kei.

160
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:33,818
We'll arrange a ceremony
for early next year!

161
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,286
No! No! No!

162
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:38,685
It must be tomorrow.

163
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,847
But the chapel --

164
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:42,618
The school gym
will do fine.

165
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:44,757
I see.

166
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:49,057
How wonderful!
Isn't this great, Kei?

167
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,664
C-ko...

168
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:00,297
Fantastic!

169
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,432
No!

170
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:08,708
A-ko is having
so much fun.

171
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:30,015
A-ko and Kei.
Kei and B-ko.

172
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:34,520
B-ko and A-ko.
A-ko and B-ko.

173
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:48,302
C-ko and...
C-ko and...

174
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,301
What about me?

175
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:07,574
"Orange Angel
I Want to Return to that World"

176
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:20,150
Oh, there you are, Darling!

177
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,287
There's something
I have to tell you.

178
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,064
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

179
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:42,237
Actually...

180
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,537
No!

181
00:21:48,013 --> 00:21:52,414
I know there's another girl.
I've known it for a long time.

182
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:55,246
But I thought I'd won.

183
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:57,215
- I'm sorry.
- But how could you?

184
00:21:57,285 --> 00:22:01,345
You kissed me, Darling!
How could you?

185
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:06,185
A single kiss
is no big deal!

186
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,555
Father, Mother, your little girl
is getting married tomorrow.

187
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:27,442
What is it?

188
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,312
A large fleet has
entered the solar system.

189
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:33,146
They're near Jupiter,
heading in.

190
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,981
A large fleet?

191
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:38,317
These are live images
from Jupiter Station.

192
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:42,484
They're cloaked in an energy
shield, and impossible to pinpoint.

193
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,322
Based on the
last invasion,

194
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:49,260
we estimate this fleet
contains over 3,000 units.

195
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:55,159
Commander, where
are you going?

196
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,462
I need a walk.

197
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,003
What should we do?

198
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,004
We can't delay, sir.

199
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:05,869
I formally request
that you assume command.

200
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:07,776
Oh, no.

201
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:31,085
C-ko...

202
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:35,325
Since we're all afraid of
the approaching aliens,

203
00:24:35,428 --> 00:24:39,887
in the time remaining, we'll work
ourselves into a berserk frenzy!

204
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:46,334
The only way to fight these
aliens is to attack them head on!

205
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:52,464
We must strike as one, in
a single, massive thrust!

206
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,566
We must be ready to
sacrifice our lives for Earth!

207
00:24:56,644 --> 00:25:01,272
So for now, just stand by,
and wait for word from above.

208
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:03,641
Just stand by.

209
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:08,276
We can't do anything until
the politicians declare war.

210
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:13,151
Don't you have the authority to
act swiftly, in case of invasion?

211
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:20,918
If Daitokuji hears about this,
we'll REALLY be in trouble!

212
00:25:20,993 --> 00:25:24,861
Commander, there's a
call from Mr. Daitokuji.

213
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,230
So you see, the wedding might
be interrupted by terrorists.

214
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:35,896
Can't you loan me a
couple of platoons?

215
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:39,804
Terrorists? Don't you
mean your daughter?

216
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:45,844
Someone in my financial position
obviously has many enemies.

217
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:50,937
Have you forgotten a certain five
million yen gift last month,

218
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,913
during the
contract bidding?

219
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:55,210
This is a bad time!

220
00:25:56,952 --> 00:25:59,920
It's not what
it sounds like!

221
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,580
We'd be happy to provide
security for the wedding.

222
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,681
You would?

223
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:08,351
We'll send you
everything we've got!

224
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,324
Hey!

225
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,055
Well, thank you!

226
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:15,188
Commander, it must be wonderful
to have such an understanding staff!

227
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,397
You may now
deploy the troops.

228
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,991
We don't need a
declaration of war,

229
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:27,698
this is simply to protect Graviton
High from terrorist activity.

230
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,541
IS THIS ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU?

231
00:26:30,643 --> 00:26:32,007
Yes.

232
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:34,634
Mobilize the
entire force!

233
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:14,396
And don't come back!

234
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,473
Captain!

235
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:32,848
I tried to find you.
But you've sunk so low!

236
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:35,446
D, is that you?

237
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:42,324
D, I'm finished.

238
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:46,258
My hotel, my recreation center,
my entire life on this planet.

239
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:48,555
Captain.

240
00:27:48,662 --> 00:27:50,823
Something BIG is
about to happen.

241
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:56,098
A great catastrophe will
engulf this world...

242
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:58,328
Nay, this entire universe.

243
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:00,630
How do you know?

244
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:02,863
Woman's intuition.

245
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:18,649
It could be... the end
of the world is upon us.

246
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:20,046
Professor!

247
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:21,885
Excellent job, Commander.
You pulled out all the stops!

248
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,666
Where is the Princess?

249
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:39,501
A wedding? Not
with our Princess!

250
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:45,740
No, we cannot allow the Princess
to marry! This must be stopped!

251
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:06,254
Miss Ayumi.

252
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:08,716
Oh, C-ko.

253
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:11,261
Gosh, you
look pretty!

254
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:13,761
Where are
A-ko and B-ko?

255
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:18,265
Miss Ayumi...

256
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:19,425
Yes?

257
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:23,970
When you get married, are
you going to quit teaching?

258
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:36,876
They're past D Point.

259
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:41,443
Commander, they've
entered the atmosphere.

260
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,675
What?

261
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:46,946
Escalate the
conflict to Level One.

262
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:52,284
Scramble Watermelon-1. They
are NOT authorized to attack.

263
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,380
Help me!

264
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:56,687
Where are you going?

265
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:03,297
I have to go to the boy's room.
You can come too, if you want.

266
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:04,728
I'll come.

267
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:07,300
Do you have accidents
in a crisis, too?

268
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,128
It comes from
having AB blood.

269
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:40,819
Oh, Kei, don't stare
at me that way!

270
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:43,489
C-ko.

271
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:05,334
Let us begin...

272
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:15,211
Those bastards think they
can crush us with numbers!

273
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:18,147
Idiot! We aren't
supposed to fire, yet.

274
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,946
We have to get some action
before they run away.

275
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,318
You're still not
supposed to shoot, yet.

276
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:34,554
And now, for the
exchange of rings.

277
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,791
Please be quiet!

278
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:48,637
Mr. Daitokuji,
what are you doing?

279
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:53,576
B-ko's in here!

280
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:57,384
That's strange,
I thought...

281
00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:59,680
Over here!

282
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:11,688
B-ko!

283
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,728
A-ko!

284
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:28,864
I won't let this charade continue.
God may allow this wedding,

285
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:31,869
but I will not!

286
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:34,875
Arrest her!

287
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:48,177
C-ko, please
stop them!

288
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,147
A-ko's always
fighting like this.

289
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,650
But...

290
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,955
But I'm always...

291
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:05,423
Platoon 7, stand by!

292
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:10,434
Nishijima Platoon, report to
Graviton Train Station immediately!

293
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:13,801
Terrorists! Kidnapping! HELP!

294
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,430
Mr. Daitokuji, look up.

295
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:20,739
The alien fleet! It's
the end of the world!

296
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:23,568
Talk sense, man!

297
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:25,875
You over there --

298
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:30,410
Gentlemen of the army!

299
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:33,883
To the gym, men! Protect
the bride and groom!

300
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:37,647
Your commander
orders it! Hurry up!

301
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:42,251
What are you doing?

302
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:45,724
How dare you come to a
wedding, dressed like that?

303
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:49,126
You should talk!
I've seen what you wear!

304
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,437
Kei!

305
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:05,269
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.
Asa, Ine, Ume: Assemble!

306
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:02,310
Assembly: complete!

307
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:03,310
Complete.

308
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:16,217
This is my ultimate weapon.
Robo A-ko: 839.

309
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:20,488
I've carefully analyzed
everything about you, A-ko.

310
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:25,086
Your powers, abilities,
proportions, and face.

311
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:27,496
That looks
nothing like me!

312
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:32,965
A-ko!
How did you get so big?

313
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:35,229
Go Robo A-ko: 839!

314
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,097
Shoot it! Shoot it!
Protect the groom!

315
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:55,008
Stop it! Stop it!
Please stop it!

316
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:07,517
Stop it! I beg you!
Stop it, all of you!

317
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:09,819
Commander!

318
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:16,556
Commander, our troops!
They've been destroyed!

319
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:25,736
You can't give up, yet!
You can't!

320
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,034
Snap out of it, man!

321
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,813
Earth has been
subjugated by the aliens.

322
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:51,378
The World Defense Force has
fallen before their onslaught.

323
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:53,588
D!

324
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:54,352
Yes!

325
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:05,058
Oh, Kei!

326
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:11,129
C-ko!

327
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:14,404
No! Kei!
I'm over here!

328
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:19,838
Kei, you can't marry
a middle-aged woman!

329
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,343
Yeah, you should
be marrying me!

330
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:25,477
What are you doing?

331
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:26,807
He's mine!

332
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:27,812
No, he's mine!

333
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:31,077
You realize, this will be
reflected in your grades!

334
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,514
Stop it.

335
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:39,487
C-ko!

336
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,556
A-ko, B-ko, Miss Ayumi,
stop it!

337
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:46,252
If you don't, I'll
take Kei myself.

338
00:39:46,326 --> 00:39:51,320
But I don't know
what you see in him!

339
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,792
C-ko...

340
00:39:57,202 --> 00:39:59,966
A-ko... A-ko...

341
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:02,368
A-ko, you fool!

342
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,234
C-ko!

343
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:07,840
C-ko!

344
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,968
Wait!

345
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,043
Here.

346
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,248
C-ko!

347
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,738
People of Earth:

348
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:56,532
Cease your struggles.
We did not come to fight.

349
00:40:57,475 --> 00:41:00,774
We only came to
recover our Princess.

350
00:41:08,151 --> 00:41:12,746
Her ship crashed on your planet,
and she was raised as an Earthling.

351
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:18,279
Her Highness must return with us,
to grace us with a royal heir.

352
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,259
We must have her back. Her
presence is essential to us.

353
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:30,594
We deeply apologize
for any inconvenience.

354
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:36,601
Wait.

355
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:42,438
She looks just like...

356
00:41:45,444 --> 00:41:47,638
You-Hoo!

357
00:41:48,146 --> 00:41:51,602
It's me! C-ko Kotobuki's
little mommy!

358
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:57,583
My little mommy?

359
00:41:57,852 --> 00:42:01,912
You got it! Come on,
C-ko, time to go home!

360
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:05,582
Wait a minute!
Who the hell are you?

361
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:08,091
Mommy!

362
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,126
I...

363
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,421
I'm coming, Mommy!

364
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,660
Really? Peachy!

365
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:19,859
C-ko!

366
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:22,162
C-ko, wait!

367
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,530
A-ko, it seems I never really
belonged here, after all.

368
00:42:30,942 --> 00:42:35,877
A-ko, thank you for everything.
Try to make peace with B-ko.

369
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,474
Don't go.

370
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,027
Thank you, everyone, for
showing me such friendship.

371
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,760
No... C-ko!

372
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:13,398
I'll always treasure the priceless
love you've all given me.

373
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:18,968
So long!

374
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,162
My Princess!

375
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,756
D, you weren't
paying attention!

376
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,131
You had to have
one last drink!

377
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,430
My Princess!

378
00:44:03,872 --> 00:44:06,067
A-ko.

379
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:09,469
Get on.

380
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:27,287
C-ko, come
play with me!

381
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,787
What are you doing?
We need more speed!

382
00:44:46,902 --> 00:44:48,802
They're getting away!

383
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:50,837
Asa, Ine, Ume, Mari
what's wrong?

384
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,031
We're out of fuel.

385
00:44:57,777 --> 00:44:59,971
C-ko's getting away!

386
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,143
A-ko, let's go!

387
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,111
B-ko!

388
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:40,837
That's the
prophecy, then.

389
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,837
The end of the world.

390
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:46,876
Once the goddess leaves, the
demons will appear on Earth.

391
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,138
"Ten Days of Blood and Fire."

392
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:53,841
When the Gate of Stars claims
the goddess, the world is doomed.

393
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:58,281
We can't let this happen!
We can't let them leave!

394
00:45:58,385 --> 00:46:00,852
We have to alert
the Defense Force!

395
00:46:00,953 --> 00:46:07,915
But there's no proof that the
ruins refer to these aliens!

396
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:13,326
When humanity hangs in the balance,
you can't worry about proof.

397
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,054
Professor!

398
00:46:15,163 --> 00:46:17,859
A pair of
equilateral triangles:

399
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:20,865
It's called the Star
of David, in Israel.

400
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:25,869
It's used throughout the world as
a symbol of magic and mysticism.

401
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:31,271
The relationship between that
symbol inscribed in these ruins,

402
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:35,867
and the symbol on the alien
ships is blatantly obvious.

403
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:37,808
- Professor!
- You think...

404
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:39,403
Their relationship is...

405
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:41,880
- Their relationship...
- is...

406
00:46:41,982 --> 00:46:44,313
A complete coincidence!

407
00:46:55,325 --> 00:46:57,519
C-ko...

408
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:06,191
What a rip-off!

409
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:09,832
This was supposed to
be a good luck charm!

410
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:11,902
I paid 30,000 yen!

411
00:47:12,002 --> 00:47:14,903
I recited the
chants every night!

412
00:47:15,005 --> 00:47:17,199
What a rip-off!

413
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:33,210
C-ko.

414
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:43,991
A-ko, you're
almost here!

415
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:04,232
Keep going, B-ko!

416
00:48:05,074 --> 00:48:07,268
I can't go on.

417
00:48:26,688 --> 00:48:29,747
How ironic.
A love suicide, with A-ko.

418
00:48:30,558 --> 00:48:32,752
C-ko.

419
00:48:34,893 --> 00:48:37,589
A shooting star!

420
00:48:37,663 --> 00:48:40,459
Haruka, what did
you wish for?

421
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:43,125
It's a secret. What
about you, Mommy?

422
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:46,998
I wished for
peace on Earth.

423
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:53,097
I wished for all the people of the
world to live together in harmony.

424
00:48:57,776 --> 00:49:00,676
The End

425
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,091
You only realize how important
something is, once you've lost it.

426
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:31,601
I came back!

427
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:35,634
C-ko, don't leave
me, ever again!

428
00:50:36,445 --> 00:50:39,207
I guess we'd
better stick together.

429
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:40,900
A-ko?

430
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:41,700
What?

431
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:46,979
- Promise you won't fight anymore.
- Okay, I'll never fight again!

432
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,314
C-ko and A-ko, B-ko
and Miss Ayumi and Mari.

433
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,300
Everyone can be
friends! Ya-hoo!

434
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:08,055
In the blooming Spring
at a platform...

435
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:14,434
We kept looking at each other
without a word

436
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:18,135
I hold my tears inside...

437
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:21,506
...and handed you a single ticket

438
00:51:21,576 --> 00:51:27,740
A ticket to the future

439
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:33,512
Leaving a shiny piece behind...

440
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:40,385
You are now leaving me

441
00:51:40,455 --> 00:51:42,149
Good bye my princess

442
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:47,092
Good bye my pure love
I will never forget about you

443
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:48,990
just for your days

444
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:53,827
I won't forget that shiny moment

445
00:51:53,898 --> 00:51:55,832
Good bye my princess

446
00:51:55,932 --> 00:52:00,368
I will never forget you
Good bye my sweet heart

447
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:02,369
Just for you at least

448
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:08,136
I'll keep my memory
deep in my heart

449
00:52:08,442 --> 00:52:14,969
Are you trying to avoid
my last words?

450
00:52:15,045 --> 00:52:21,074
Here comes a train
in the red Sunset

451
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:28,384
Holding a little trunk in your arms

452
00:52:28,456 --> 00:52:35,120
You turned your back on me
quietly with a smile

453
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:47,294
The platform's signal is slowly
turning you into a memory

454
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:49,132
Good bye my princess

455
00:52:49,204 --> 00:52:53,901
Good bye my pure love
Please don't forget about me

456
00:52:53,973 --> 00:52:55,871
Just for your days

457
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:00,706
Remember our love was like a
shining jewelry

458
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,540
Good bye my princess

459
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:07,411
Good bye my sweet heart
I know you won't forget

460
00:53:07,482 --> 00:53:09,347
Just for your dreams

461
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:15,355
Every time you close your eyes
please remember...

462
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:20,891
I want to rewind our clock...

463
00:53:22,025 --> 00:53:27,190
...and chase our dreams
together again

464
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:35,191
Until we grow up...
