1
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:39,244
And now the news.

2
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:50,090
Three weeks ago, an alien spaceship
crash-landed on the city center.

3
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:55,760
Now the spaceship has been rebuilt
as a giant amusement center.

4
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,304
Boasting a posh hotel,

5
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:03,400
it has attracted huge crowds to its
shopping and recreation facilities.

6
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:07,641
We're reporting today
on-site at this new center.

7
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:24,229
But I've been waiting so
long for summer vacation!

8
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,193
Here you go.

9
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:36,733
It's horrible that you guys have to
go to America on a business trip.

10
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,272
What an appetite.

11
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,480
It's more horrible to think
of you over-eating all summer.

12
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:51,148
You'll add four inches
to your waistline.

13
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:54,159
I'll be okay. I get
lots of exercise.

14
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:58,926
Hey Dad, aren't you going to eat
that? I'll finish it for you.

15
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:10,908
I was saving that for last!

16
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:18,177
There's nothing
to cry about, Dad.

17
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:23,518
Your business trip isn't that long.
You'll be back in four weeks.

18
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:44,302
And now, let's interview
the owner, Miss Napolipolita.

19
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:49,542
We have absolutely
nothing insidious planned.

20
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:51,208
Of course not!

21
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:54,219
We heard that you Earthlings
love shopping malls.

22
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:57,222
It has nothing to do
with the repairs we need,

23
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,225
or the huge sums of money
needed to pay for them.

24
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:05,424
No, not at all! We only
want to be your friends!

25
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:10,430
The Director of Defense had no
comment on these developments.

26
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:13,667
This ends our report for
the DNA network, Japan.

27
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,077
The government is hesitant to get
involved, after last year's fiasco.

28
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,740
And now, these messages.

29
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,448
A-ko, time for school!

30
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,163
Already? I'm late!

31
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,430
Good morning A-ko!

32
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,762
C-ko, you're here already?

33
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,932
Of course she is!

34
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:50,768
A-ko, we're
gonna be late!

35
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:53,312
Hold on, I'll
be right down!

36
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,143
Sorry to make you wait!

37
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,481
We'll take the shortcut.

38
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,138
Princess,

39
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:26,042
I hereby pledge to secretly
watch over you and protect you,

40
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:30,405
until the day when we both
return to our homeland.

41
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:33,384
But you're sure
running late today.

42
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:34,886
Has something happened?

43
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,116
Hi, D!

44
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,017
Here we go!

45
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,021
Princess!

46
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,033
We're too late!

47
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:06,415
Look, A-ko, what's this?

48
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,324
Oh, I saw a bug make it.

49
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,826
Huh? A buck naked?

50
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,555
C-ko, hurry up.

51
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:20,465
Good morning, class.
Be silent.

52
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:28,568
I'm sure you're all looking forward
to summer vacation tomorrow.

53
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,275
That bitch, A-ko.

54
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:37,316
Is she making
C-ko late again?

55
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,517
Good morning!

56
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:42,953
Good morning,
Miss Ayumi!

57
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:45,150
A-ko, C-ko!

58
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:50,087
How could you be late on
the last day of class?

59
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,966
No, no! I got a
present for you.

60
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:55,160
Here, it's buck naked.

61
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:56,968
Buck naked?

62
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,971
lt looks like a dead bug.

63
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,473
What? Cooks like a bread-bug?

64
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,735
Just forget it.

65
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,835
I'll have to make
some for lunch.

66
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:09,310
Quiet down, everyone.

67
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:12,977
I hope you all enjoy
your summer vacations.

68
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:16,955
I'm gonna have lots of fun!

69
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,526
That's good. You're
always so energetic.

70
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:22,527
Thanks!

71
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:26,497
Now class, I'm going
to pass out your grades.

72
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,890
I'm doomed!

73
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,603
Now that your parents are gone,
I'll come over every day!

74
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,439
Let's go to the pool tomorrow.

75
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,604
Yeah, yeah. I'll go!

76
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:45,009
- Let's leave about ten.
- I'm going to the pool!

77
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:48,282
I'm going to the pool!

78
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,523
Tomorrow at ten.

79
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,458
I won't let A-ko
monopolize C-ko.

80
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,546
One-potato, one-potato,
one-potato,

81
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,775
Hey, A-ko!

82
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,212
Sorry I'm late!

83
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,786
A-ko!

84
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,390
Come on, let's go!

85
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,624
You already changed?

86
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,066
I'll see you outside.

87
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,228
Wait for me!

88
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:55,177
I'm ready!

89
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:22,908
Wow! Cool!

90
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,051
Oh, it's Miss Ayumi!

91
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:44,635
Great form!

92
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,865
Great muscle tone!

93
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:51,308
Gotcha!

94
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,807
I'm pretty good, aren't I?

95
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,816
You sure are!

96
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,148
A-ko can swim
really well, too!

97
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,381
No way!
Well, maybe.

98
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,103
Isn't she great?

99
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:34,185
I wonder what
happened to A-ko?

100
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:36,654
I wonder if she's okay?

101
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:42,354
Miss Ayumi, do you think A-ko's
okay? She hasn't come up yet.

102
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:46,728
My great-grandfather jumped
into the ocean in 1909,

103
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,199
and he still
hasn't come up.

104
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,363
Wow! Maybe A-ko's
doing that too!

105
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,377
A-ko!

106
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,947
Gee, I almost drowned!

107
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:21,965
I thought I was gonna die!

108
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:24,963
So, you're here.

109
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:29,734
What a coincidence!

110
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,970
B-ko!

111
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:37,612
B-ko, don't
you ever give up?

112
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:39,549
You want to steal C-ko!

113
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:42,520
Are you saying I can't come
and swim in a public pool?

114
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:45,819
Hey, we're twins!

115
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:50,489
Let's go swimming!

116
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,326
Hey, where's A-ko?

117
00:10:55,835 --> 00:11:01,740
It's settled then. The winner gets
to take C-ko on a date tonight.

118
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,075
Whatever you say!

119
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:06,771
Look A-ko!
I can swim, too!

120
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,510
All right. Ready...

121
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:16,651
Come on in, Mari!

122
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,157
Go!

123
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,237
Ouch.

124
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:53,118
I'm all washed up!

125
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:14,073
It's your fault that
I didn't beat A-ko!

126
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:19,111
I can't stand it! Tonight, I'll
make a new mecha to destroy A-ko!

127
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,385
Stop it,
that's too hard!

128
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:28,591
This is great! Well,
it's almost lunchtime.

129
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,397
C-ko, let's grab a bite!

130
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,533
Oh, no!

131
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:42,301
Here you go, A-ko!

132
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:49,438
Now that I think about it,
I'm not really that hungry!

133
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:54,678
I made it JUST for you!
It's really good! Here! Here!

134
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,019
Eat it! Eat it!

135
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,053
Come on!

136
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,625
Tee hee!

137
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,397
Good morning!

138
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,402
Oh, D!

139
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:16,067
Hey, D! C-ko made this!
Want some? Here!

140
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:22,039
A lunch made
by my princess?

141
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,413
Thank you, I'm honored!

142
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,077
Let's trade!

143
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:30,088
Eat up, D!
It's really good!

144
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,351
Thank you.

145
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,229
Isn't it great?

146
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:42,960
Oh, yes!

147
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,935
Eat it all up!

148
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,005
Yes, ma'am!

149
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:49,774
Saved!

150
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:53,278
Could you come with us--

151
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:56,782
No! You're trying to
take her away again!

152
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,283
No, no, you've
got me all wrong.

153
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:02,082
Our spaceship
doesn't fly any more.

154
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:05,852
So we were thinking
of settling down here.

155
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,592
Here, Princess,
look at this!

156
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:23,103
Hey, A-ko, it's a
recreation center!

157
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,303
A recreation center?

158
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:30,907
Exactly. We're turning it into an
entertainment and cultural center.

159
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,311
I wanna go!

160
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:34,614
Please come, Princess!

161
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,318
Are you just
after our money?

162
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:40,119
No, you'd be our guests.

163
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:43,128
We'll even throw
in dinner, for free.

164
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:47,866
Okay, let's go.

165
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,993
Oh boy!

166
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,331
You'll show us around?

167
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,563
My pleasure.

168
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,568
I did it!

169
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:04,638
Wow! Incredible!

170
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,112
Just like a dragon!

171
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,853
Well, let's go.

172
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,650
Come on, D.

173
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,918
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,670
I have your reports, sir.

175
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,678
Good work.

176
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,681
Are you free tonight?

177
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,979
No, I'll be working late.

178
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,768
What's this?

179
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,279
It's perfect! Just wait
till you see this one!

180
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,847
Father!

181
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,421
B-ko, are you making
another mecha?

182
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:25,987
Yes, Father.

183
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:29,367
Yes, I see...

184
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,436
This is--

185
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:34,666
B-ko!

186
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,505
Do you have any idea how
much this would cost me?

187
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:47,175
I'm confiscating these!

188
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,550
All right.

189
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,023
Nice view!

190
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:03,627
I can't believe I'm
really inside a spaceship!

191
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:08,140
This is a special room. Regular
guests are never allowed in here.

192
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,640
Enjoy your meal.

193
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,870
Okay!

194
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,640
I'll have this!

195
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,391
What's wrong?

196
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,394
Princess...

197
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,469
I want to go home!

198
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,668
Back to my home planet!

199
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:46,473
Please help me!

200
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:50,777
But you can't. I heard
your engines were wrecked.

201
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,913
Please help me!

202
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:10,360
Poor Captain!

203
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:13,030
A-ko, you have to help her!

204
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,405
What do you
expect me to do?

205
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,374
All right,

206
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,504
I'll see what I can do.

207
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:27,411
Mr. Director.
It's Daitokuji.

208
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:30,353
How's the project going?

209
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,885
What? Your hands are tied?

210
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:38,055
So you want me to help out?

211
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:43,463
Actually, I've just
developed a new weapon.

212
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,068
If you're interested,
it's available.

213
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:51,910
In exchange, I expect access
to your secret weapon.

214
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,543
You must be joking!

215
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:01,109
The spaceship is full of civilians!
It's a recreation center now!

216
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,984
Don't worry about it!
I'll take care of that.

217
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:10,125
We can't afford to
damage that ship.

218
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,256
I can arrange for a
hostage, if we need one.

219
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:18,998
Her name's C-ko. Part of the
royal family, but a strange child.

220
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:21,264
I don't anticipate
any problems.

221
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,434
She goes to school
with my daughter.

222
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,603
That's a good one!

223
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,574
C-ko!

224
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:33,448
Yes, everyone's trying to get
their spies onboard that ship.

225
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,387
We have to move on this
as soon as possible.

226
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,583
What's going on?

227
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:01,736
A-ko, are you all right?

228
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,188
A-ko!

229
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,225
It'll never work...

230
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:50,651
It's not working.

231
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,663
Oh, I know!
Don't worry.

232
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:55,495
I'll fix everything tomorrow!

233
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:11,372
Ladies and gentlemen...

234
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,918
Thank you all for coming.

235
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:16,546
It's good to see you here.

236
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:22,694
Three weeks ago, an alien spaceship
attempted to invade our planet.

237
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:28,059
The Earth Defense Force has always
been proud of its interceptors.

238
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:32,399
But against the aliens, all of our
weapons proved to be incredibly...

239
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:33,199
beautifully...

240
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:34,398
magnificently...

241
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,304
USELESS!

242
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:39,070
But this is only a
temporary setback!

243
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:44,138
I, Teru Daitokuji, have poured my
heart and soul into a new machine!

244
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,275
Look closely!

245
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:51,585
Presenting the Daitokuji
special interceptor:

246
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,921
The "Cherry Blossom"
Mark III.

247
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:56,291
Also known as "Marilyn".

248
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,857
With a vulcan cannon
and 500mm steel armor,

249
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:06,929
this sleek beauty is an engine of
annihilation -- a marvel of mayhem!

250
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:12,205
Every facet of its design
overflows with lethal efficiency.

251
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:16,338
It's a monster machine, ready
for top-level destruction!

252
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,243
Well, Mr. Director?

253
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:21,309
A few of these should let you
walk all over that spaceship!

254
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:26,851
Fantastic! We'll finally be able
to destroy that hated spaceship!

255
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,124
Mr. Director! You can't
destroy the spaceship!

256
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,961
It's filled with
alien super-technology!

257
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:38,697
Once I get it, I want to
study it at my leisure!

258
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:43,105
Impossible! A capture
would be much more difficult.

259
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,777
Look at this! Here!

260
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:50,508
This tear gas will destroy
their ability to fight!

261
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,015
Please!

262
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:54,279
Oh, okay.

263
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:14,464
Wow! There's so much food!

264
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,798
I'm so glad you could come over.

265
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:22,005
Eat up! Have as much as you like.

266
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:33,323
Wow, what a big bathtub!

267
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:36,793
It's so big, it's so big!

268
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:46,135
So, C-ko, what did
you want to ask me?

269
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:48,698
Well...

270
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,113
Hey, Captain!

271
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:07,323
Your ship can't even
lift off, can it?

272
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,791
Our antigravity units
are completely blown.

273
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,059
I'd get angry if
you stole C-ko again.

274
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:18,763
It doesn't matter. My ship is
ruined, and no one can fix it.

275
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,199
One moment...

276
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,737
B-ko!

277
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,277
Perhaps you should
give me a chance.

278
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:29,045
How did you get in here?

279
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:33,910
There's nothing
I can't do!

280
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,926
A-ko, if l can just fix this
ship, C-ko will be mine!

281
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:58,333
Hi, A-ko!

282
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,138
C-ko, where'd you go?

283
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,044
I was worried about you.

284
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:04,275
Why?

285
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,786
I went to see B-ko.
I asked her to fix the ship!

286
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,114
Oh, so that's it!

287
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,590
That's why B-ko's here.

288
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:31,801
What's going on?

289
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:36,507
What? Where? Who?
What's wrong? Tell me!

290
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:43,585
C-ko will be mine!
You're finished, A-ko!

291
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:53,963
Scary!

292
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,162
I've finished!
It's perfect!

293
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:58,965
Really?

294
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:01,972
If you're lying,
you're gonna get it!

295
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,601
I told you there was
nothing I couldn't do!

296
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,009
Didn't you believe me?

297
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:10,175
Thank you!

298
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:12,774
D, we can
finally go home!

299
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:18,116
Now, to finish up!

300
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,654
Captain, we can
finally go home!

301
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,358
It's been a long
time, hasn't it, D?

302
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:28,694
Hi there!

303
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:32,430
Our ship has been
repaired, Your Majesty!

304
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:33,698
That's great!

305
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:35,239
There, there!

306
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:37,502
Hey, Captain...

307
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,269
Who are all those people?

308
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,274
WHAT?

309
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:54,354
When does the attack
commence, Daitokuji?

310
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:59,527
We'll know soon. My
agents inside will alert me.

311
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:02,260
We can't turn this city
into a battlefield!

312
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:07,302
I know that. It would destroy the
world's trust in its defense force.

313
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:14,369
Raise your hands! Hand over
the spaceship peacefully!

314
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:20,546
- You're KGB!
- You're CIA!

315
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:25,050
You're OSI!

316
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:27,489
You're Secret Service!

317
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,936
What are you doing?
We're ready to take off!

318
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:45,136
Hey, stop it! You fools! I can't
stand it! I can't stand it!

319
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,496
That's the signal!
It's time, Mr. Director!

320
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:11,894
Attack!

321
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:41,259
There, finished!

322
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:50,602
Hello? Bridge?
Captain?

323
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:57,304
She doesn't seem to be there.
But we're ready to lift off.

324
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,588
The timer should automatically
start the engines in five minutes.

325
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,122
We have to hurry. As soon as
the engine's ready, we'll lift off.

326
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,552
We're moving!

327
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:45,189
We're on our way --

328
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:52,994
Stop! Hand over C-ko peacefully!

329
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:10,212
Mari!

330
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:12,722
We've come
to save C-ko!

331
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:16,857
Who are you?

332
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:44,378
Your body will explode
in exactly three seconds!

333
00:30:56,468 --> 00:31:01,428
Captain! Enemy mecha in block 29!
We can't hold them back!

334
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,201
Captain!

335
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:06,972
C-ko, wait here!
I'll try to help!

336
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:09,275
Wait, A-ko, wait!

337
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:11,144
You must stay,
Princess!

338
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:48,683
That's the last piece!
It's done!

339
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:51,415
Now, C-ko will be mine!

340
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,032
This must be the place!

341
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:11,336
Out of the way!

342
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:13,604
Shut up!

343
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,619
You jerk!

344
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,163
My eyes!

345
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,186
Hey, no shooting
inside the ship!

346
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:28,482
She's a monster!

347
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,620
This is Marilyn 3!
This is Marilyn 3!

348
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,158
We need backup!

349
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:37,820
This is Marilyn 5!
Presently engaged in combat--

350
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,488
-- red-haired girl --

351
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,431
Daitokuji, what's
going on here?

352
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:50,202
You said those machines
were invincible!

353
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:55,009
Mr. Director, those puny
mecha were just for show.

354
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,446
Now it's time
for the big guns.

355
00:33:57,515 --> 00:34:01,451
Hello? Catherine,
Elizabeth, Diana, COME HERE!

356
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:10,688
I, the Chief of Development,
am responding to your call!

357
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:16,459
The Chief of Commerce
is also on the scene!

358
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,463
Mr. Daitokuji, I'm ready
to give my life for you!

359
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:23,673
Ready!

360
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:27,406
Form Queen Margarita!

361
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:07,945
But that mecha -- !

362
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:41,274
Cringe in fear at the sight of
Earth's most terrible weapon!

363
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:46,085
Father! How could you? That's the
Sakurajima 43 I designed last week!

364
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:50,191
Be quiet! B-ko, get out of
that spaceship immediately!

365
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:54,120
After all, the spaceship and
everything in it will soon be mine!

366
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,367
What?

367
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:21,883
What IS that robot? It looks
like one of B-ko's stupid gadgets!

368
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:30,733
Sir, a red-haired girl is running
up the arm of the Queen Margarita!

369
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:35,034
Red-haired girl? Why does
that sound so familiar?

370
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:41,303
That's the girl that's always
making my little B-ko cry!

371
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:43,540
That impudent fool!

372
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:53,313
What are these
stupid metal balls?

373
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:56,189
Chief of Development,
explain this!

374
00:36:56,261 --> 00:37:00,698
I followed your blueprints
exactly, Mr. Daitokuji!

375
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:08,534
Oh, yeah. Well anyway,
continue the attack!

376
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:15,639
Oh no!

377
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,386
Don't we have something
better in here?

378
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:26,913
Press the switch on the right, sir.
It activates the laser cannon.

379
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:31,559
You idiot! Why didn't
you say that earlier!

380
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:42,600
Stop moving around
so much, dammit!

381
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:45,503
Got her!

382
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:54,475
Take that! Take that!
Take that!

383
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:04,428
Take that!
Take that! Run, run!

384
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:13,962
Mr. Daitokuji,
please be careful!

385
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:30,520
How beautiful!
C'est magnifique!

386
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:32,918
It must be a festival!

387
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,861
My stupid father!

388
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:51,942
Father, stop
getting in my way!

389
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,169
Akagiyama Missiles!

390
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:58,174
Stop that, young lady!

391
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:09,321
Oh no!

392
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,391
Great! It works!

393
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:17,457
Wow, we're moving!

394
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:18,263
Captain!

395
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:20,896
D, we're finally going home!

396
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:29,570
A-ko, save me!
We're flying away!

397
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:32,978
Farewell!

398
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:37,147
We're taking the princess
back home! So long!

399
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,347
A-ko!

400
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,858
Dammit! They won't
get away from me!

401
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:06,743
C-ko...

402
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:15,959
Damn you! You let
my spaceship escape!

403
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,619
Now you must die!

404
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,630
A-ko, you fool!

405
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,137
Shut up!

406
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,542
I've done it!

407
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,211
Gentlemen, did you observe?

408
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:47,057
Isn't it a bit early
to be celebrating?

409
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:10,581
A-ko, this is all your fault!
You should have prevented this!

410
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,081
Shut up, B-ko!

411
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,210
If you'd been watching C-ko,
they couldn't have kidnapped her!

412
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:24,519
Help! I'm floating!
Get me down!

413
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:40,406
Luck is with me!
It's all mine, now!

414
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,868
It's mine!

415
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:13,268
There goes my pension
and retirement fund!

416
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:09,418
A-ko, time for the pool!

417
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:03,245
While walking down the
street I happened to

418
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:10,213
pass a diner that was
packed with lovers.

419
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:15,718
Suddenly I
looked across,

420
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:19,658
and I saw you
standing there.

421
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,427
I heard the beauty
of summer sing to me.

422
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:27,797
For just a few days ago,

423
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:29,601
You had always been,

424
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:32,107
The boyfriend of
my best friend.

425
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:34,804
Now sensations come to me,

426
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:36,608
Strange they may be,

427
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,807
And I feel the
trembling in my heart.

428
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:42,683
Oh baby, feel my inspiration,

429
00:45:42,753 --> 00:45:45,813
And baby, take my invitation,

430
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,825
Oh can't you hear
that sweet melody,

431
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:53,387
That brings on
sparkling seasons.

432
00:45:53,898 --> 00:45:56,423
Every time you look at me,

433
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,833
I know you wanna
be my new boyfriend,

434
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:05,865
I hear the start of our
best summer ringing true.

435
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:23,820
We have many
friendly conversations,

436
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:30,500
but I always hide my
true feeling towards you.

437
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:39,033
I've been in love with you
all this time.

438
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:43,772
I want to tell you
for the first time.

439
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:51,654
You tell me you can't hear me
because the radio is too loud,

440
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:58,127
and you look into my face closely
with a polo shirt on.

441
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:01,928
Oh baby, feel my inspiration,

442
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:05,400
And baby, take my invitation,

443
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:09,530
I can't contain the
beating of my heart

444
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:13,270
That's leaping in
this new wind.

445
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:15,778
Every time you smile at me,

446
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:19,282
You know lI wanna be
your new girlfriend,

447
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:25,983
And now the dream of my
entire life is coming true.

448
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:31,957
But when I see that
old girlfriend of yours,

449
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:40,197
I wonder what I
will say to her?

450
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,831
Oh baby, feel my inspiration,

451
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,503
And baby, take my invitation,

452
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:51,912
Oh can't you hear
that sweet melody,

453
00:47:51,982 --> 00:47:56,476
That brings on
sparkling seasons.

454
00:47:56,554 --> 00:47:59,022
Every time you look at me,

455
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:02,490
I know you wanna
be my new boyfriend,

456
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,826
I hear the start of our
best summer ringing true.

457
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,667
And baby, take my invitation,

458
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:16,172
I can't contain the
beating of my heart

459
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,506
That's leaping in
this new wind.

460
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:23,103
Every time you smile at me,

461
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,513
You know I wanna be
your new girlfriend,

462
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:32,284
And now the dream of my
entire life is coming true.
