1
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,579
Kotobuki

2
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:52,254
I see.
Thank you.

3
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,071
Mr. Chairman...

4
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:03,631
Your daughter turns
ten years old today.

5
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:08,045
This must be a very
happy day for you.

6
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:11,049
My best wishes
for both of you.

7
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:16,817
Thank you. I didn't
have her until I was 40.

8
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:19,915
I know I spoil her,
but I can't help it.

9
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,662
You're all ready,
Miss C-ko.

10
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,963
It's great! Hurray!

11
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,433
My party's today!
My party's today!

12
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:40,111
I'm so happy!

13
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:42,977
Ma'am, you're ten
years old today.

14
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:47,520
You promised to start acting
more grown-up, remember?

15
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,814
I guess so.

16
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:53,688
Well, we'd better
get to the party.

17
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,193
They're waiting.

18
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:56,762
Okay!

19
00:01:56,863 --> 00:02:01,027
I'm sorry, but the young
lady is coming with us.

20
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,362
Who's there?

21
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:05,636
Who are you?

22
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,071
Shut up, or
the kid gets it.

23
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:13,169
That's right. But if you behave,
no one's going to get hurt.

24
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,808
Come along quietly.

25
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,641
Do you think you can
get away with this?

26
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,152
Of course I can.

27
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:26,155
I've cut off all communications
outside this room.

28
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,853
And the bodyguards are
having a little nap.

29
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:32,295
Well, we must
be going.

30
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:36,495
Sweet dreams.

31
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,806
It's time, Mr. Chairman.

32
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:45,810
So it is.
Would you get C-ko?

33
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,142
After all, she's
the guest of honor.

34
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:50,113
Of course, sir.

35
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,756
What's going on?

36
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,762
I'll find out, sir.

37
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:06,958
Activate hull closure units!

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,760
Catastrophe, Mr. Chairman!
Your daughter's been kidnapped!

39
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:13,703
What?

40
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,776
Their ship blasted through
the hull and escaped.

41
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:20,711
We're launching fighters in
pursuit. We should have them soon.

42
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,131
We have ten fighters
on our tail.

43
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,633
- Want to take them out for me?
- Okay.

44
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:56,205
Here they come! Remember men,
we're only trying to stop them.

45
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:58,910
Our mission is to capture, not
destroy. We'll use the net.

46
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,200
I was hoping for
more of a challenge.

47
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,726
They've hit the engine room!
Power's down by a third!

48
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,320
How's it going, Liza?

49
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,232
I'm done here.

50
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:53,864
I think you were a
little rough on them.

51
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:56,306
I guess I like
to play rough.

52
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,604
That's for sure.

53
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,773
There! It's six
kilometers, southwest!

54
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:39,147
Roger.
Let's go, A-ko!

55
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,939
- Here it comes!
- Full speed ahead!

56
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:41,644
Oh no! It's mad!

57
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:45,078
Come on!

58
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,397
Thanks again.

59
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:35,500
Next time, try to
get us a better one.

60
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:36,933
How'd we do?

61
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:37,934
Not so good.

62
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:41,234
We would have gotten more, if
you hadn't smashed a hole in it.

63
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,640
Let's go, A-ko.

64
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,080
- Uh, B-ko...
- What?

65
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,513
I was just wondering...

66
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,221
What's the big idea?

67
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:00,724
How else can we transport
all this stuff?

68
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,625
It's getting late, we
don't have time to argue.

69
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,130
Come on. I'll
meet you there.

70
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,103
You're always pulling
something like this on me.

71
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:17,267
I guess it's too
late to complain.

72
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,874
We're almost there, Liza.

73
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:30,578
Grash, what do we
need the kid for?

74
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,691
Beats me.

75
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:37,251
I just follow
Gail's instructions.

76
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:40,196
He never tells
me the details.

77
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:45,203
So what do you think
of his latest plan?

78
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,432
What do you mean?

79
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,637
The idea of reviving Xena,
calling up a dragon-god,

80
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:55,213
to make a new
universe for ourselves.

81
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:59,046
I have a hard time
believing in this dragon-god.

82
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,211
It's too late to complain.

83
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:04,654
Besides, the universe is
a big place. Who knows?

84
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:07,920
But it's out of our hands,
it's up to Gail, now.

85
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,920
Fire in the engine!

86
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,226
Damn, we can't
afford trouble now!

87
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,495
Fire in the aft compartment.

88
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,161
The automatic
extinguishers?

89
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,329
Off-line.

90
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,168
Take care of it, Liza!

91
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:22,036
Okay!

92
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,126
Just keep quiet.

93
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:50,194
Liza! The hull's breached!

94
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,294
I'm taking us down!

95
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,904
It's too smokey!
I'm gonna die!

96
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:02,278
What's wrong, Liza?
Get back to the cockpit!

97
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:08,275
Nice to meet you,
Granny! I'm C-ko!

98
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm only 24!

99
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:17,690
Liza! Come in!

100
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,894
Too bad.

101
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:56,427
B-ko's going to hear
from me, once I get back!

102
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:07,302
Oh no, I'm getting hungry!
I've gotta get home!

103
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:14,479
I'm so hungry, even my
backpack feels heavier!

104
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,225
What a disaster.

105
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:32,702
I'm sorry. I should
have been more careful.

106
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:36,468
We'll have to contact
Gail for new orders.

107
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:42,170
At least it's not too far to
the sub-sand cruiser. Let's go.

108
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:53,249
We know who the
kidnappers are.

109
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,291
What?

110
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:02,528
The man is Grash. He's a pirate,
known to operate in this sector.

111
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:04,762
He mainly hits transport
and research ships.

112
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:10,036
His partner, Liza,
is incredibly violent.

113
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:13,704
She functions as the muscle
for Grash's operation.

114
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:16,714
They're wanted by
the Space Patrol.

115
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,683
Your daughter may
be their hostage.

116
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:23,381
We think we know
where they're heading.

117
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:28,051
Their destination could be
any of three possible planets.

118
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:34,157
We've hired people on all three
planets to search for them.

119
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:42,064
We're putting your daughter's
safety above all else.

120
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:45,406
But I don't understand
why they kidnapped her.

121
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:50,915
I'll pay whatever they want. I
want C-ko back as soon as possible.

122
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:55,948
If anything happened to her,
I don't know what I'd do!

123
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:06,665
She should be home soon.

124
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:11,034
B-ko, I'm home.

125
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,936
I'm done for.

126
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:19,205
Good work. Leave your
backpack, because dinner's ready.

127
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,973
Why don't you
freshen up, first?

128
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:23,413
Really? That's great, B-ko!

129
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,024
I'm hungry.

130
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,967
Great shower.

131
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,010
What do you think
you're doing?

132
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,146
That hurt!

133
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,020
Stop it! That's disgusting!

134
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,864
A-ko! What are
you crying for?

135
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,162
B-ko, get out here!

136
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:19,395
What is it?

137
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,168
B-ko!

138
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:28,908
This brat snuck in, while
I was in the shower!

139
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,006
How cute!

140
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,643
There, there,
what's wrong?

141
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:35,482
Don't cry.

142
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:38,489
But I'm soooo hungry!

143
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:44,260
Does that give you the right
to take someone else's dinner?

144
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:46,997
Would you shut up?

145
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:51,331
What are you saying? Imagine
how I feel! I'm starving!

146
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,338
You're being childish.
She's just a little girl.

147
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,670
She's a little brat!

148
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:59,176
It's not like
you're going to die.

149
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,270
I'm so hungry,
I could die!

150
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:06,283
- You don't have to make her cry.
- I'd like to cry!

151
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:12,449
Remember where we are. It's
three days to the nearest town!

152
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:18,019
So where'd she come from?
Isn't it kind of weird?

153
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,595
Stop eating!

154
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,131
Shut up! Crying isn't
going to fix anything!

155
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,402
You don't have
to get mad!

156
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:33,478
She's taking
advantage of us!

157
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,673
We should listen
to her, at least!

158
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,483
- Well, that's a surprise.
- It sure is.

159
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:45,819
It looks like our
luck isn't all bad.

160
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,829
Do you like it?

161
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:54,126
It's delicious!

162
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,665
Now I'm all full!

163
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,500
What's your name?

164
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:03,268
I'm C-ko Kotobuki!
I'm ten years old today!

165
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,936
Oh, that's wonderful!
Congratulations.

166
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:07,512
Congratulations!

167
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:11,174
Kotobuki... that's
an unusual name.

168
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:15,983
Daddy owns a big company.
He's got lots and lots of money!

169
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:21,424
That's nice. So, where are your
parents now? Are you here alone?

170
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,863
Nope, I came
with my daddy.

171
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:29,424
But my mommy died when I was
little, so now I don't have one.

172
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:30,901
Oh, I see.

173
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,631
What are you
crying for, B-ko?

174
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:37,470
Where's her father or
this huge company now?

175
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,977
Get real! This Lolita
complex is just disgusting!

176
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,572
Just be quiet
and eat your food!

177
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,080
So, where's
your father now?

178
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,490
I don't know.
He went somewhere.

179
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:55,651
He went somewhere?

180
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,525
So where'd you come from?

181
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:02,590
I came from planet Marinay,
and we got on this big ship,

182
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:07,503
and we were going to Fantasia, and
they were having this big party,

183
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:11,770
and then I got sleepy, and
I woke up on another ship,

184
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,868
and then I fell down here!

185
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,776
What's she talking about?

186
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:18,076
Is this Fantasia?

187
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:23,444
Fantasia's in a different sector!
How can you fall out of a starship?

188
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:27,652
Why are you listening
to this garbage?

189
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,629
Kotobuki... Marinay...
a big ship... Fantasia... C-ko.

190
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:34,825
B-ko! Aren't you
listening to me?

191
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:37,930
B-ko?

192
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,465
What are you doing?

193
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:45,009
Just a second.

194
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,648
A-ko, come here!

195
00:17:58,758 --> 00:17:59,486
What?

196
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,822
Just hurry up and
get over here!

197
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,021
I was going to
hit the sack.

198
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,292
Hurry up!

199
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,337
What is it?

200
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:13,598
Look at this!

201
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,435
What about it?

202
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,102
"The chairman of
Kotobuki Industries,"

203
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:24,672
"is shown here with his only heir--
his daughter C-ko." That's her!

204
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:30,946
According to this, she should
be aboard the Kotobuki Princess,

205
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:34,992
which is traveling to the planet
Fantasia on its maiden voyage.

206
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:38,463
Pretty much
follows her story.

207
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,122
lt-- it-- it can't be!

208
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:43,463
What -- what -- what's
she doing here?

209
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,764
Let's ask her.

210
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:48,306
But-- but-- but-- She's a
girl just like this one!

211
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,932
Her-- her-- her
name's the same!

212
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:53,637
What are you so
flustered about, A-ko?

213
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:57,910
I'M BORED! LET'S PLAY!

214
00:18:58,017 --> 00:18:59,644
Oh, I'm sorry.

215
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:05,622
I have to check out her story.
A-ko, could you play with her?

216
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:12,928
Sorry about what happened before,
kid. What do you want to play?

217
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:14,329
Really?

218
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:24,905
Who are you?

219
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,912
Don't do
anything stupid.

220
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,415
Come with me.

221
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,682
No, I wanna
play with THEM!

222
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:37,813
Stop crying.

223
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:38,753
No! No!

224
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:42,589
I like them better
than I like you, Granny!

225
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,261
Watch your mouth, kid!

226
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:51,432
Behave yourself, or it'll
be even worse, next time.

227
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:53,600
Brat!

228
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,606
That's enough!

229
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,109
You've got some nerve,
invading our house!

230
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:01,509
But you won't
get away with it.

231
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:05,779
And who's going to stop
me? You want to try?

232
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,045
If you insist.

233
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,416
Be careful, A-ko.

234
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:12,753
What's wrong? What
are you waiting for?

235
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,957
Don't underestimate me.

236
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,622
- B-ko, take care of the kid.
- Okay.

237
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:20,858
Let's go!

238
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,422
Serves you right!

239
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,452
I see.

240
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,093
A-ko, be careful
inside the house!

241
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:57,032
How can you worry about the house,
when I'm fighting for my life?

242
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,546
A-ko!

243
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:15,949
And I thought you'd be a
little more entertaining.

244
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:20,252
Not dead yet?

245
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:24,989
Don't you dare
mess up my hair!

246
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,365
You bitch!

247
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:06,866
Wow!

248
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:14,710
You're so cool! You saved
me! My hero! My hero!

249
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:19,617
I'm glad you beat her, but what
are we going to do about that wall?

250
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:21,913
I, uh...

251
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,589
Don't play dumb with me!

252
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,652
You're responsible
for this damage!

253
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:36,696
Wait a second!
Why is it MY fault?

254
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,995
You didn't lift a
finger to help me!

255
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:45,236
Because you told me
to watch the kid!

256
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:47,904
But you just stood there!

257
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,413
I'm more delicate
than you are.

258
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:55,078
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You wouldn't understand,

259
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:59,521
but a lot of men would be
very unhappy if I got hurt.

260
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,253
What are you
talking about?

261
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,853
The only men around here
are withered old prunes!

262
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:08,364
You're dating THEM?

263
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:09,866
How dare you!

264
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,163
Score one for me!

265
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:41,356
I never expected to run into
someone like you, out here.

266
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:47,867
I'd like to stay and finish
things, but I'm already late.

267
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,248
What are you going
to do with her?

268
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:04,846
She's mine now, so that's
my business -- not yours.

269
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:09,894
Besides, you two are the
ones who invaded MY house.

270
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:11,389
What's that
supposed to mean?

271
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,665
What's going on?

272
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:03,508
What happened?
Where's our house?

273
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:04,514
What's this?

274
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:10,619
It's a sub-sand cruiser! This
couldn't have been under our house!

275
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:12,554
It was.

276
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,154
We'll meet again.

277
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:27,668
What took you?

278
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:30,105
Sorry. Where's the brat?

279
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,609
Tied up in the cabin.

280
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:42,977
A-ko! Are you all right?

281
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,453
Are you still alive?

282
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,219
A-ko!

283
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,522
Hang on!

284
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:54,259
A-ko!

285
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:33,531
Quit doing that!

286
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:37,673
What the hell
was that for?

287
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:43,113
I'm sorry!

288
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:45,274
Could you
bring that back?

289
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:47,318
What are you up to?

290
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,216
Isn't it obvious?

291
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:52,654
So why do you need
a giant toilet?

292
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:55,693
This looks NOTHING
like a toilet!

293
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,227
Then what is it?

294
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,263
An anti-submersible skimmer!

295
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:03,266
Really? Looks
like a toilet to me.

296
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:08,535
I couldn't help it. These were
the only parts I could salvage.

297
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,404
What are you going
to do with it?

298
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,174
I'm going to follow that cruiser
and rescue the girl, of course!

299
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:18,681
You're going to
fight them in that?

300
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:22,185
Aren't you mad about
what they did to us?

301
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,652
Of course I'm mad.

302
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,349
We struggled so hard!

303
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:30,895
Then suddenly, everything's
wiped away in a single cruel blow!

304
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:35,228
Well I won't stand for it! They
will suffer DIVINE RETRIBUTION!

305
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:40,203
They think they can destroy our
lovely home and get away with it,

306
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:45,971
but I'll show them the terrible
wrath of a woman scorned!

307
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:51,179
Mommy, I'm scared.

308
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:55,310
Think, A-ko. That girl is the
heir to the Kotobuki fortune!

309
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,481
She was probably kidnapped,
and that means...

310
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,694
If we rescued C-ko,

311
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:06,195
Kotobuki Industries would
be incredibly grateful.

312
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:10,632
Then we'd be living
the good life!

313
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,636
Thank you,
Professor B-ko!

314
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:17,368
Another plunder planned!
You're a sharp one, yes indeed!

315
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:21,976
I'm coming for you, you
jiggling juggernaut!

316
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:26,479
I'm coming to
save you, C-ko!

317
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,631
You did it!

318
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:46,192
A tracking device
and a pursuit ship!

319
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:47,566
It's nothing.

320
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:13,458
Grash has done well.

321
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:35,612
Dammit! Who's dumb enough
to attack a sand cruiser?

322
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,188
There's a small
ship on our tail.

323
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,814
They're after us.

324
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:43,019
Really? Are they nuts?

325
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,599
- I'm counterattacking.
- Okay.

326
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:44,578
- Six sand mines!
- What?

327
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:06,205
Now, A-ko!

328
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:41,677
What's going on?
How'd they do this?

329
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,838
What?

330
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:45,712
Who are you?

331
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:47,307
It's you!

332
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:50,354
Sorry, but we're
taking the kid.

333
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:52,320
It's you!

334
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:53,322
Bye!

335
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:54,915
Bye!

336
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:01,626
You've gone too far!

337
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:06,704
Liza!

338
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:08,670
A-ko!

339
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,401
What are you doing, A-ko?
We almost had her!

340
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,848
Liza, I'll take
care of the cruiser!

341
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,652
I'll take C-ko
back, or die trying!

342
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:24,221
Then you'll die!

343
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:40,935
What's keeping them, now?

344
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:53,150
They've found me! I can no
longer afford this delay.

345
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,392
Got her!

346
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:39,096
I was prepared for
this eventuality.

347
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,743
Oh no!

348
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:03,713
That was close.

349
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:11,153
I thought I just blew you up.
You must be pretty tough.

350
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:15,499
Naturally. It'll take more
than that to stop me.

351
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,867
You're not too bad looking,
either. I like your style.

352
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:22,065
Grash.

353
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:28,977
Gail, what are
you doing here?

354
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,981
How long are you going
to drag this out?

355
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,541
Kotobuki's pursuit
ships will be here soon.

356
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,746
I expected
better from you.

357
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,086
Well, we had a
few setbacks.

358
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:41,522
Where's the girl?

359
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:42,957
Right here.

360
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:46,360
Then it's time to go.
Where's Liza?

361
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:48,523
She's taking
care of someone.

362
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:51,534
The fleet's almost
here. Hurry up.

363
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:52,967
What about her?

364
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:56,199
It's just a woman.
Leave her.

365
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:59,333
Just a woman? Don't
underestimate me!

366
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,341
Come on, Grash.

367
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,774
Hold on, there!

368
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:20,458
A-ko...

369
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:25,867
B-ko!

370
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,585
Bitch!

371
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:12,271
This is my starship spin!

372
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,280
Get out of my sight!

373
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:17,684
Is that the
best you can do?

374
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,914
Liza!

375
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:23,090
- Stop playing around.
- Gail!

376
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:27,153
It looks less like play and
more like bitter combat.

377
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:30,098
We can't waste time with
these trifles. Come on.

378
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:34,737
I haven't finished
her off yet!

379
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:36,238
It doesn't matter, Liza.

380
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:40,904
Liza!

381
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:50,753
We've got the
kid. Leave it.

382
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:51,844
We're leaving.

383
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:55,190
Sorry, but this
will have to wait.

384
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:56,726
You're running away?

385
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,261
I won't let you
take the girl!

386
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:08,203
Enough, woman, or you'll end
up dead, like your partner.

387
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:16,844
If you don't believe me,
take a look for yourself.

388
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:32,656
B-ko!

389
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:48,272
B-ko!

390
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,616
It can't be!

391
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,988
Hey, hey!

392
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:09,362
B-ko, dinner's ready!

393
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:11,993
Cootchie
cootchie!

394
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:13,400
Wake up!

395
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,699
Come on, wake up!

396
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:20,342
Stop playing dead!

397
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:37,050
It's not true. B-ko,
you can't be dead.

398
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:40,386
Shall I revive her?

399
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:45,561
Of course! She's my only
friend! Don't be stupid!

400
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,802
We still have time.

401
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,965
What are you?
Are you alive?

402
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,873
Do you truly
want her back?

403
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,412
Well, yeah, but can
you really do it?

404
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:59,347
I can bring her
back to life, but...

405
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:00,076
But?

406
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:02,984
We have to hurry.
There's not much time.

407
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,351
Then hurry up!
Bring her back!

408
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:07,947
Relax.

409
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,323
How can you say that?

410
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,989
I'm Maruten.
Pleased to meet you.

411
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,194
You look ludicrous.

412
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:21,402
Ludicrous?

413
00:39:21,506 --> 00:39:24,031
Do not be deceived
by my appearance.

414
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:28,968
I'm sorry, Mr. Maruten.
Please bring B-ko back to life!

415
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,982
Okay. But I won't do it for
free. Let's make a deal.

416
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:36,281
Are you trying to
take advantage of me?

417
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:39,379
Don't do that, if
you want B-ko back!

418
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,822
All right! All right!

419
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:49,396
What sort of deal do you mean?
If it's money you want, I'm broke.

420
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,990
I don't need money.

421
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,569
Then what?

422
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:57,132
Oh, I get it!
You want my body!

423
00:39:57,241 --> 00:40:01,302
That must be it! I'm
so young and pretty.

424
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:04,870
Please, no more! I
beg you! No more!

425
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,986
To be the playtoy of this ludicrous
bulbhead, for my entire life!

426
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,992
I'll die, without ever
discovering the joys of true love.

427
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:19,155
But that doesn't matter.

428
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:23,324
I'll gladly sacrifice
my life, to save B-ko.

429
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:27,871
I'm sorry, but we seem to have
a terrible misunderstanding.

430
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:32,236
Before I explain,
would you lick this?

431
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:36,140
What's this? This
isn't poisoned, is it?

432
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:38,374
This is just
for verification.

433
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:41,941
A light touch
should do it.

434
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:47,251
- Don't you want to save B-ko?
- Oh, all right.

435
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:49,693
Here, is this okay?

436
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:53,855
I knew it! I'm in dire
need of your assistance.

437
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:55,762
My assistance?

438
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,097
I'll try to be brief.

439
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,071
I'm a member of the Space Patrol.
I'm from the Eley III star system.

440
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:07,110
I'm pursuing a group
of vile criminals.

441
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:12,438
These fiends have caused untold
destruction in my star system.

442
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,417
They arrogantly boast
of their brutality.

443
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,015
The Space Patrol has fought
them across whole star systems.

444
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,391
After a terrible war,
we killed their leader.

445
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:29,956
But just as we were about to catch
the last of them, they escaped.

446
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:33,366
We followed them to
this star system.

447
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:37,872
One by one, my comrades have
been killed off. I'm the last.

448
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:41,911
But I've managed to track
them to this planet.

449
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,640
I'm on the verge
of stopping them,

450
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,516
but I can't do it alone.

451
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,589
I need your assistance.

452
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:55,859
Please help me.

453
00:41:56,994 --> 00:42:01,431
I don't want my comrades to have
died in vain. You have to help me.

454
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,431
I don't know
what I can do,

455
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:07,936
but if I accept, you'll
save B-ko's life, right?

456
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,438
I promise!

457
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:12,433
Okay. So who
are these people?

458
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:17,378
The man you just met, the one who
killed B-ko, is their new leader.

459
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:19,676
His name is Gail.

460
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:25,852
Mr. Chairman,
don't do this!

461
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,891
She's your
only daughter,

462
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:31,826
but you can't put
yourself at risk!

463
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:36,026
Calm down. This won't be the
first battlefield I've seen.

464
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,998
Don't get in my way.

465
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:41,469
That's not what I
meant! Please, sir!

466
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:44,973
If you don't shut
up, you're fired!

467
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:46,441
Mr. Chairman!

468
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,177
I'm coming, too!

469
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:51,714
You are?

470
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:20,135
Just a little
longer, Dragon-god.

471
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:23,941
Soon, your master
will return.

472
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:52,175
Spirit of Xena, arise from
your troubled slumber.

473
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:55,245
Return, and join
the Dragon-god.

474
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:59,214
Yo! What's up, Liza?

475
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:01,683
Nothing.

476
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,413
Where's Gail?

477
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:04,488
In there.

478
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:08,889
Really? I guess he's
resurrecting Xena.

479
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:12,152
So what are you
sulking about?

480
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:13,127
Nothing.

481
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,631
You're still upset
about that fight!

482
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:19,134
No I'm not.

483
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:25,141
Yeah, that's it! I've never
seen you so hard-pressed.

484
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:29,144
Are you saying I lost?
To that little twerp?

485
00:44:29,246 --> 00:44:32,807
No! No! Calm down!

486
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:34,983
Hey, Liza...

487
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:38,613
Just you wait! The
next time we meet...

488
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:42,692
I'll have her head!

489
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:50,167
I think it's over there.

490
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:51,666
That's it.

491
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:56,604
This is my job. There's
no reason for you to come.

492
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:59,174
I can't let you
go alone, A-ko.

493
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:03,007
I refuse to spend the rest
of my life in debt to you.

494
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:06,606
Besides, I can't ignore
what's going on over there.

495
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:08,617
I'm worried
about the girl.

496
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,450
Fine, do whatever you
want. I won't stop you.

497
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:15,047
But stay out of my way.

498
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:20,096
Whom is usually
in who's way?

499
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:23,200
All right, all
right, I'm sorry.

500
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:34,805
We will build a new universe,
after annihilating the old one.

501
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:38,507
Xena, accept this new vessel,
and fill it with your essence.

502
00:45:42,086 --> 00:45:47,285
Return to this realm, Xena and
the Dragon-god! Accept my power!

503
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:10,665
Out of the sky, falling down,
Just like sand to the ground,

504
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:14,670
Night descends hard
on this gray town.

505
00:47:16,113 --> 00:47:21,517
Pajama clad, I get up,
Through the window, I look out.

506
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,850
When will he come,
the angel I've been waiting for?

507
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:31,692
Why, when I search for my
dreams, I go,

508
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:36,697
And get hurt
for all my troubles?

509
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:41,599
Why don't you answer me,
Oh, Angel?

510
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:43,673
Please don't hurt me, Angel.

511
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:48,370
Before I become tainted
without your love.

512
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:52,611
All this sand is
full of sadness,

513
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:55,514
My heart is filled with it.

514
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:00,113
My smile hides all I feel,
from everyone.

515
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:03,716
I want to hear your love.

516
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:27,743
Throughout the maze of this city,
The fallen people wander 'round,

517
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:31,681
Pound the walls
and sigh, saying,

518
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:38,685
I will return to that day,

519
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:42,863
This is just like
a world of games for you.

520
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:48,531
My eyes overflow
with tears now,

521
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:53,707
But I don't want
to cry anymore.

522
00:48:55,546 --> 00:48:58,640
In every heart now,
you are, Angel.

523
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:00,774
And you know it, Angel.

524
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:05,412
You can never doubt
the trueness of you.

525
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:09,556
The lie you thought you forgot
is alive,

526
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,220
Coloring all the winds.

527
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,993
And so, go and throw
all of your light,

528
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:19,661
Into the misty future.

529
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:23,073
Why don't you answer me,
Oh, Angel?

530
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:25,607
Please don't hurt me, Angel.

531
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:29,839
Before I become tainted
without your love.

532
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:34,109
All this sand is
full of sadness,

533
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:36,914
My heart is filled with it.

534
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:41,924
My smile hides all I feel,
from everyone.

535
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:46,690
I want to hear your love.
