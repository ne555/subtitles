13

I win! I beat you!

14
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:19,189
I'm sick of taking tests.

15
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:22,756
Well, today's the last day.
Spring break starts tomorrow.

16
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,565
We'll have lots of fun!

17
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:29,768
I hope so. I want
to find a boyfriend.

18
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,812
A normal boyfriend,
like any normal girl.

19
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,645
We'll go to Disneyland,
and I'll get popcorn,

20
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:40,848
and ice cream
and French pudding!

21
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:45,758
I'll need a new dress. I'll lose
two centimeters around the waist,

22
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:48,763
And I have to
get my hair done.

23
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:52,629
I wish it was
already spring break!

24
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,847
Sorry, didn't mean
to disturb you.

25
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,132
And then, at the movies,

26
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:29,837
he'll say, "Your waist!
It's so slender!"

27
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:34,851
What is A-ko
smirking about?

28
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:38,312
This break, C-ko
will be mine!

29
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:43,821
We'll go on a picnic, and
I'll bring a pink lunchbox.

30
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,329
That's right!
I have to make lunch!

31
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,158
Winter was so long!

32
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:54,305
These damn tests
are almost over!

33
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:58,099
What a boring
girl's school!

34
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:01,581
The flowers
are in bloom!

35
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,496
Just two more centimeters,
and I'll have a boyfriend!

36
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,661
The Riviera or somewhere
in the south of France.

37
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,035
Or maybe I should buy
C-ko a castle in Germany.

38
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,080
And I'll bring my Koala
backpack and some cake...

39
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:30,842
Yes!

40
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:33,881
I'll remember this
vacation forever!

41
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:37,384
Yes! A single night
of romantic bliss.

42
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:41,024
And I'll wear my
yellow bunny undies!

43
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,230
What did you say?

44
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,766
What? Did I say something?

45
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:53,602
It's finally over!

46
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:01,609
We did it!

47
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,084
Now start
the planning!

48
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:09,683
It's finally time
to celebrate!

49
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,081
That's great!
I want one!

50
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:34,118
Stop that, C-ko, you're
embarrassing me. Let's go.

51
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:38,353
I was just looking.
What's the hurry?

52
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:42,028
It's spring. I want
to buy some new clothes.

53
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:44,327
Come on, this way.

54
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,479
Gorgeous!

55
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:04,723
That blouse is beautiful.

56
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,170
What's wrong,
A-ko?

57
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:19,672
It comes to
240,000 yen.

58
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,174
Then just buy
one piece.

59
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,220
It's too much. I can't even afford
shoes or a purse or anything.

60
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:38,324
Wanna have
a crepe?

61
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:40,624
No thanks.

62
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,299
How about some
snack cakes?

63
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,863
They're 92
calories each.

64
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:54,308
How am I going to find a
boyfriend if I'm always with C-ko?

65
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:57,450
Are you tired of
shopping, yet?

66
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,286
Well, maybe...

67
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:02,583
not!

68
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,725
How pretty!

69
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,159
Care to try it on?

70
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,253
I can't...

71
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:12,630
It won't hurt,
just to try it on.

72
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,930
Yeah, but...

73
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:20,636
I guess it's no good, after all.

74
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:24,442
You look great in it!
Really cute!

75
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:27,985
Here, try on these shoes.

76
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,988
We could put your
hair up like this...

77
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,752
You think so?

78
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:38,695
But now your ears look lonely,
so how about these earrings?

79
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,630
She looks terrible.

80
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,668
A-ko, let's go!

81
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,909
Just a minute.
What do you think, C-ko?

82
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,775
You look stupid!
Acting so grown up!

83
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,339
I know you're still wearing
your panda undies!

84
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,420
Quit it!
I am not!

85
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,816
And, and...

86
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,054
I hate those
earrings!

87
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,455
Wait!

88
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:26,051
Are you okay?

89
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,566
Hey, wait!

90
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:01,621
C-KO!

91
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:05,791
Excuse me!

92
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:59,149
Damn it! I had to go and buy
them, just 'cause C-ko lost one.

93
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:02,492
But that dress
was so beautiful.

94
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:05,761
It would change
my life, if only...

95
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:09,470
That's just what I
need, this spring.

96
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:12,507
But it costs
25,900 yen.

97
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:16,477
I know!

98
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:33,020
What's your analysis
of this situation?

99
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:39,571
Stop stuffing yourselves!

100
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,975
All right. Asa,
what's your opinion?

101
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,547
I think they're
just out shopping.

102
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:47,547
Ine?

103
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,619
Maybe she's going
to a costume ball.

104
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:57,382
Your analysis is flawed. A-ko must
have something special planned.

105
00:11:57,661 --> 00:12:02,224
This must be thoroughly
investigated. Understand?

106
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,233
Yes!

107
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:08,231
She's no match for my meticulous
planning and covert intelligence.

108
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:21,079
Good afternoon.
May I take your order?

109
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,421
It's me, C-ko!

110
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,356
Hello. How
may I help you?

111
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,462
Let's see...

112
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,935
A teriyaki hamburger
and a Coke.

113
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:40,670
Would you like
fries with that?

114
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,180
I've always wanted
to say that!

115
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:47,014
The apple pies are
great today. Want one?

116
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,748
I'll have
whatever you say.

117
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:52,758
Okay. A 16-pack of
nuggets, a large fries,

118
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,696
and a rum-raisin ice cream,
all in a jumbo-size happy meal.

119
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:04,297
C-ko, you've come three days in a
row. Do you have any money left?

120
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:06,705
No!

121
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,869
Why don't you
wait in the park?

122
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:12,711
I'll be over as soon
as I've finished work.

123
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,187
I feel sorry for her.

124
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,890
Coke.

125
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,466
Yes, sir.

126
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:46,749
I'm really, really sorry
about running you down.

127
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:50,087
I didn't think I'd ever
be meeting you again.

128
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:53,424
He's so handsome!

129
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,135
Here's your Coke.

130
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:02,365
"Was he trying to find me?"

131
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:05,905
"What should I do?"

132
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,770
Hold it right
there, A-ko!

133
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:16,881
This is a violation of Graviton
High's conduct regulations!

134
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,458
B-ko!

135
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,323
Part-time jobs are prohibited!

136
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:25,560
I'll have to report this
to the discipline board!

137
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:30,406
And the... uh... repercussions...

138
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:33,000
"Who IS that man?"
And the... uh... repercussions...

139
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:38,677
But don't worry. I've
decided not to turn you in.

140
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,185
So, who's your friend?

141
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,092
Kei!

142
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,667
What am I doing?

143
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,067
This is our second time...

144
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:03,370
Only the second time?

145
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,513
My shift's over! I have to go!
I have to meet someone!

146
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:17,791
I mean, I have to meet
a girl! Her name's C-ko.

147
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,885
I'll never make
it in time!

148
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:24,366
A-ko, hurry up! You can't
leave your lover waiting!

149
00:16:30,976 --> 00:16:35,413
Really? Are you sure it's okay?
You'll give me a ride?

150
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:39,579
That's great!
See you, B-ko!

151
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:50,290
So I fibbed a little. The long
route is much more scenic.

152
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:28,633
I can hear his
heart beating.

153
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:34,578
It's like a dream!
I could die!

154
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,011
Sorry I'm late, C-ko.

155
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,381
Oh, this is Kei.

156
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,339
Stop it!

157
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:28,379
Sorry, she's
always like this.

158
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:32,508
Thank you for the ride.
It was wonderful.

159
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,778
What?

160
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:05,514
What the hell?

161
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,450
What the hell
is this?

162
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,493
He walked
right past me!

163
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:15,158
In all my sixteen years,
I've NEVER been so humiliated!

164
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:40,394
He was wonderful!
So quiet.

165
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:44,194
I've always dreamed
of riding a motorcycle!

166
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:51,374
We watched the sunset together.
He told me I was pretty.

167
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:53,376
What?
He said that?

168
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:57,278
Not exactly, but I
could see it in his eyes.

169
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:01,453
I dream about
him, every night.

170
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:03,579
My heart's pounding.

171
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,236
I wish B-ko would give us a
raise. I'm tired of ramen.

172
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:18,533
He's here.

173
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:22,976
He's gorgeous!

174
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:25,537
What a hunk!

175
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,247
I want that man!

176
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:34,618
Hello again!

177
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:39,624
One Coke?

178
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:43,500
Here you go!

179
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,401
Thanks.

180
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,111
Thanks.

181
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:54,407
Thanks.

182
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,606
Thanks.

183
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:58,276
Thanks.

184
00:21:58,386 --> 00:21:59,444
Thanks.

185
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:02,747
Hey!

186
00:22:02,857 --> 00:22:08,023
Get a move on!
Help the next customer.

187
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,425
I'm sorry.

188
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:14,436
Oh, there he is.

189
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:20,040
He's sitting with C-ko.
He's waiting for me!

190
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:27,111
Why'd he go home?
Did he say anything?

191
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:29,153
No, nothing.

192
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,050
Oh, no!

193
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:32,451
It's true.

194
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:40,327
Here.

195
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:56,514
What? There's a party!
It's an invitation!

196
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:01,319
He must have been too shy
to give it to me directly!

197
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:02,619
This Sunday,

198
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:05,127
at six,

199
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:07,823
at the Spaceship Hotel.
Got it.

200
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,211
Excellent job, team.
You may have the night off.

201
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:23,647
Goodnight,
ma'am.

202
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:32,422
What is this trembling I feel?
Could it be what men call love?

203
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,860
Oh, Kei, my first love.

204
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,867
But I can't! It
wouldn't be right.

205
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,932
I've made a commitment to
C-ko. How can I abandon her?

206
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:51,448
I feel such anguish.
I... I love C-ko!

207
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:54,518
And yet, I can't
ignore my love for Kei.

208
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:56,451
Oh, well!

209
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:58,750
Here we go!

210
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:09,229
Oh, this'll never do!

211
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:13,971
Just three short days.

212
00:24:14,075 --> 00:24:16,909
In three days, I'll
be wearing that dress.

213
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:21,005
I'll look so beautiful.
I'll be a brand new me!

214
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:55,147
To the loyal patrons
of the Spaceship Hotel,

215
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:56,986
we have good news.

216
00:24:57,092 --> 00:25:03,464
The resort will be reopened
tomorrow night at ten.

217
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:09,995
There will be a commemorative
party to celebrate the occasion.

218
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:13,531
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I had to work late.

219
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:15,544
What's up,
A-ko?

220
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:19,343
I'm getting in
shape! Wait here.

221
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,053
In shape?

222
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,896
Rotten!

223
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:35,900
No!

224
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:38,198
Yuck!

225
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:40,972
Another try.

226
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:02,427
I worked out, and lost
the two centimeters!

227
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:05,594
I'll tell him at the
party. "I love you."

228
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:08,935
I'll have to build
up my courage.

229
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,942
That's it! I'm
going to do it!

230
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:25,283
I can't laugh, or I'll get
wrinkles. But look at A-ko!

231
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,629
She looks
simply monstrous!

232
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:33,462
I'm surprised she
doesn't crack the mirror.

233
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:41,234
No one would ever go out
with her! But I can't laugh.

234
00:27:04,938 --> 00:27:09,433
I've finally finished work,
and now the dress is mine!

235
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:14,742
What? It's gone?

236
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,217
Gone, gone, gone?
Completely vanished?

237
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:22,690
But the party's tonight! I'd
do anything for that dress!

238
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:25,727
I'm sorry, but we
sold it yesterday.

239
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:29,630
I'm sure we can find
something else for you.

240
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:33,697
No.

241
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:36,733
No.

242
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:48,713
Why can't we wear
the same thing?

243
00:27:48,822 --> 00:27:51,188
But I wanted THAT dress!

244
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:58,392
He'd take me in his arms, and
carry me up the red velvet stairs.

245
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,231
Like in
Gone With the Wind!

246
00:28:01,337 --> 00:28:03,202
Just forget it!

247
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:07,607
You're mean! You never
used to be this mean to me!

248
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,075
C-ko!

249
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:22,755
Why do you always have
to be so mean to me?

250
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,292
This thing's heavy!

251
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:55,888
It's so pretty here!

252
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,663
Yeah.
How do I look?

253
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,932
You look really good.

254
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,806
Where are your
wrist bands?

255
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,308
Oh, you noticed?

256
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:09,711
They didn't go with the
dress, so I left them home.

257
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:21,828
A-ko!

258
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,124
Uh, hi.

259
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,837
My dress!
Oh, no!

260
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:31,930
My beautiful
dream!

261
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:37,844
Oh, A-ko, what are you doing
here? What a coincidence.

262
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:40,940
And what's with the dress?
It's sooo attractive.

263
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:45,285
Shut up! What I wear
is my business!

264
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,994
What's B-ko doing here?

265
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,314
I'd like to thank
you all for coming.

266
00:30:10,418 --> 00:30:15,482
Thanks to our customers, we've
been able to reopen the resort.

267
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:17,925
And since
I'm so happy,

268
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:22,055
I'd like to sing a song
I wrote for this occasion.

269
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:25,329
Please feel free
to clap along.

270
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:31,899
Pappan ga,
pan pan pan!

271
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,913
We got hot water,

272
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:39,917
In our
spaceship bathtubs,

273
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:42,180
Pappan ga,
pan pan pan!

274
00:30:55,036 --> 00:31:01,033
Oh, A-ko, what are you doing
here? What a coincidence.

275
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:05,940
And what's with the dress?
It's sooo attractive.

276
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:10,483
How did B-ko
get in here?

277
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:14,047
I'll never let
A-ko have him!

278
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,391
With his good looks, Kei's
a perfect match for me.

279
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:24,232
So why would he fall for a cow like
A-ko? What could he see in her?

280
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:28,404
Why's he interested
in a gorilla like her?

281
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:33,003
If you're going to have a
monologue, keep it to yourself!

282
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,983
Kei! Thank you so
much for the invitation!

283
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:44,822
Yes, Kei. I was overjoyed
to receive your invitation.

284
00:31:45,094 --> 00:31:48,029
But why did you
send it through A-ko?

285
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:50,498
There's no need
to be so shy.

286
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:53,001
Not where
I'm concerned.

287
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:54,832
Say, B-ko...

288
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:59,567
I don't remember seeing
your name on the invitation.

289
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:06,477
Poor A-ko. You just don't
understand how subtle Kei is.

290
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,949
If you insist on
being so dense,

291
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:12,958
Kei will think
you're an idiot.

292
00:32:16,564 --> 00:32:20,796
B-ko, if you want a fight...

293
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,410
Oh, no! I took off
my wrist bands!

294
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:38,216
Oh, you and
your jokes, A-ko.

295
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,922
Yeah, here's a
joke for you!

296
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:53,766
What?

297
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:06,916
Unit A to Unit B. Destruction
of the spaceship has commenced.

298
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:08,581
Alert the director.

299
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:10,886
Roger.

300
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,158
The director says his ulcer hurts,
and he's going to lie down.

301
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:18,258
What?

302
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:19,858
What should we do?

303
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:23,100
We can't do anything without
the director's approval.

304
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:28,145
Oh, I give up! Soldier,
you didn't see anything!

305
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:29,373
Yes, sir.

306
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:30,607
Mr. Okao!

307
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:32,343
Yes, sir?

308
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:36,946
It's an emergency. Our pathetic
defense force has abandoned us.

309
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,184
It's up to us, now.

310
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:44,890
Send forth the call,
throughout the city!

311
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:51,637
Emergency alert! Emergency
alert! Calling all public workers!

312
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,202
North Side team, assemble at
Pier 4. East Side to Wharf 3.

313
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,810
West Side team to Warehouse 7, and
South Side to the Spaceship Hotel!

314
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,453
What are you doing?

315
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,457
Just be quiet.

316
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:19,464
No, don't!

317
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:25,768
Sorry to interrupt boys,
but it's an emergency.

318
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:29,473
Everyone mobilize,
pretty please.

319
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:48,263
It's a
mobilization alert.

320
00:34:48,372 --> 00:34:51,637
We're sorry.
Please come again.

321
00:34:51,742 --> 00:34:53,209
Come on.

322
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,372
You know how irritated the
shift manager gets if we're late.

323
00:34:57,482 --> 00:34:58,972
It's starting.

324
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:16,464
It's beginning.

325
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:23,811
How I've waited
for this!

326
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,914
All systems:
Code GREEN.

327
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:29,875
Launch!

328
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:38,885
An alert!

329
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:41,962
I've been
waiting for this!

330
00:35:54,815 --> 00:36:01,722
Now entering L Formation.
Evacuate all non-essential personnel.

331
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:07,558
All non-essential personnel
must be evacuated.

332
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:47,333
All units in
position, Mr. Mayor.

333
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:51,401
If the conflict escalates,
we'll have to move in.

334
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,709
Until then,
stand by.

335
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:05,355
You don't know how hard I
worked to make tonight perfect!

336
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:09,866
Kei's not looking
for a clod like you.

337
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:14,406
He's much better suited to
a person of my intellect.

338
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:15,997
Shut up!

339
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,304
Make me!

340
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,003
C-ko...

341
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:23,813
C-ko...

342
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,409
I just wanted to say,

343
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:27,783
I...

344
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,379
...love...

345
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,388
...you.

346
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:40,492
Of course.
What a nice couple.

347
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:49,912
No! He was only using
me to get close to C-ko.

348
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:52,813
I...

349
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:57,818
He won't get
away with this!

350
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:00,625
