1
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:18,016
After graduation, we
all said our good-byes,

2
00:00:18,128 --> 00:00:20,596
and began our rookie year
in the business world.

3
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:30,504
I was hired as a secretary
in a first-rate company.

4
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:34,268
I made plenty of
mistakes at first, but --

5
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:38,008
A-ko!

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,914
Kei!

7
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:52,390
But --

8
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:54,023
It can't be!

9
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:59,531
But it is. I intended to break up
with that conniving witch, but...

10
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:00,997
A-ko!

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,594
B-ko? You mean SHE'S
the conniving witch?

12
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:08,233
Hey, A-ko.

13
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:13,033
B-ko! Why are you
dressed like that?

14
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,342
You're the one
who's dressed wrong.

15
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:20,009
What's going on here?

16
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,019
We hunt sand turtles
on a desert planet.

17
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:26,851
But someone kidnapped C-ko, whose
father owns Kotobuki Industries.

18
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,517
We fought the kidnappers,
and I died.

19
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:32,094
But Maruten of the
Space Patrol saved me,

20
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:36,496
Now we're standing directly in
front of the enemy's main base.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,466
You mean we're
supposed to fight THAT?

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,014
What's wrong? Were they
picking on you again?

23
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:33,016
Why do they have to
be so cruel, Sister?

24
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,586
I know I'm just a
poor orphan, but --

25
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:37,018
Don't talk that way.

26
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:41,024
It's precisely because the
world has gone so wrong,

27
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:44,094
that you must strive
so hard to find wisdom.

28
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:49,189
You were born to bring light
back into this poor, dark world.

29
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:52,429
Sister...

30
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:56,663
There are infinite
possibilities in this universe.

31
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,073
But today, people
have forgotten God.

32
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:04,977
Every year, they travel farther
down the road of corruption.

33
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,811
We must turn them back
toward the true path.

34
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,146
How can we do that?

35
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,987
The Dragon-god
must be revived.

36
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:17,149
It will lead God back to
this wretched universe.

37
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:22,218
The only one who knew how to call
back the Dragon-god was Xena.

38
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,993
But our teacher Xena was
unable to complete her mission.

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,469
And Xena's only living
descendant is Gail -- you.

40
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:35,065
You must call back her spirit so that
she may summon the Dragon-god.

41
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:42,047
Then the Dragon-god will lead
us all to the one true God.

42
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:44,310
It shall be.

43
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,084
Gail, don't!

44
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,384
Gail!

45
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:13,470
B-ko?

46
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:18,214
Snap out of it!
We're going home.

47
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:23,282
But you promised you'd help,
if I brought B-ko back to life.

48
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:27,686
What am I supposed to do against
that monster? All I have is this.

49
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,655
That's no ordinary sword!

50
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,594
It's the legendary weapon
that killed the sorceress Xena!

51
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:39,258
What's so great about it? Look,
just because you brought B-ko back,

52
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:42,895
doesn't mean you can order
me around. Let's go, B-ko.

53
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,864
You can't deny
your true heritage!

54
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:54,280
You must protect the universe! If
you have any love in your heart --

55
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:55,314
None at all.

56
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,281
You know the danger!

57
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:58,352
No I don't.

58
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:00,443
Destiny calls!

59
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:04,216
B-ko, I love what you've
done with your hair!

60
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:05,382
Really?

61
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,960
There's also the reward.

62
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:12,389
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

63
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,558
The Federation
will pay handsomely.

64
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:20,401
They'd support you in style
for the rest of your life.

65
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:22,235
I must perform my duty!

66
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:24,241
What happened
to your voice?

67
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:27,744
She's always like that
when she talks about money.

68
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:30,040
I see.

69
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,945
But can I do it with
one crummy sword?

70
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,419
It was just an illusion.

71
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:44,688
It is a sign.
Xena has been revived!

72
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,160
Xena?

73
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,227
Well...

74
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,968
Lady Xena.

75
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:18,456
Gail, I finished
repairing the ship.

76
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,326
How's it going with the little
creep -- I mean, Lady Xena?

77
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:29,468
She's ready to descend
into the human vessel.

78
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,800
So we'll finally get
our new universe?

79
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:37,069
What's wrong?

80
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:38,734
Nothing.

81
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:52,520
That must be a
ventilation duct.

82
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,716
What's wrong?

83
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:56,851
Nothing.

84
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:59,623
You were
supposed to fix her!

85
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,754
I did!

86
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:02,992
I'm okay, let's go.

87
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:04,466
All right.

88
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:07,731
You're not going to get
physical again, are you?

89
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:10,329
You got a
better suggestion?

90
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:14,240
I have special equipment
to avoid detection.

91
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,402
What's he getting?

92
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:18,743
Maybe a dimensional door,
or a portable hole?

93
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:24,282
A disguise kit!

94
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,445
All right!

95
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:30,322
What is it?

96
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,325
Intruders!

97
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:34,418
This moment is too crucial.

98
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,144
Who's there?

99
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:12,628
B-ko, why'd you take
that stupid outfit?

100
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:13,789
There they are!

101
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,490
Kill them!

102
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,431
Maruten, which way?

103
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,638
To the right!

104
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,479
Straight ahead.

105
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:40,921
A-ko, wait for me!

106
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,453
Excuse me.

107
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,182
So who is this Gail guy?

108
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,116
He's a medium.

109
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,085
Medium?

110
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,783
Only Xena could
control the dragon.

111
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,452
Gail has called her spirit back.

112
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,629
I hate it when that happens.

113
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,635
Xena mastered a method for
summoning the Dragon-god.

114
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,137
She was too old and
weak to cast the spell.

115
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:37,800
But C-ko's body is
young and strong.

116
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,174
If she awakens now --

117
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,941
But why C-ko?

118
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,648
I think --

119
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,650
I knew it was you!

120
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:51,586
It took guts to
make it this far.

121
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,421
This time, no one's
going to interrupt us!

122
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:02,660
A-ko?

123
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:05,860
Damn her! Running
off on her own!

124
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:08,300
A-ko?

125
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:18,038
This is the second
time we've met.

126
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:21,810
It's you!

127
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:25,374
Only two women have
ever felt my touch.

128
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,687
You're the only
one to survive.

129
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:39,095
You have beautiful eyes.
They shine with intelligence.

130
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:46,205
This must be God's will.

131
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:51,270
You're beautiful.

132
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:23,739
Gail, what are you doing? Do
you want to rule the universe?

133
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:32,579
Rule it? This wreck of a universe?
No, I plan to replace it.

134
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,977
Replace it?

135
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:41,954
Before I can create a new universe,
I must obliterate the old one.

136
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:44,986
200 years ago,

137
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:51,691
Xena learned to harness negative
energy and shaped it into a dragon.

138
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,792
She pronounced final judgment
on this degenerate universe.

139
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:59,703
But her body
was too weak.

140
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:02,776
She died, and her creation
vanished with her.

141
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:06,141
Now, I have finally
brought her spirit back,

142
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:09,647
and implanted it in the body
of a healthy young girl.

143
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:11,307
The final days are
upon us at last!

144
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,954
Would you stop me?

145
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:28,591
Will I be able to see
your new universe?

146
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:50,018
- What the hell?
- The reactor's running wild!

147
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,554
- We're lifting off!
- What?

148
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,957
We're leaving.

149
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,070
Don't run away,
you coward!

150
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:14,630
I don't have time
to play right now!

151
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:15,970
Dead ahead!

152
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,656
Gail!

153
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,627
We can't stop the ship! We're
heading straight for the town!

154
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,925
You!

155
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:42,225
Don't worry.

156
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,825
But the town...

157
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,131
What about it?

158
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:53,036
There he is! B-ko!

159
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:54,806
I've found you, Gail!

160
00:13:54,913 --> 00:14:00,145
Now you will have to contend
with Maruten of the Space Patrol!

161
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,548
B-ko!

162
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:05,645
The Space Patrol? I
thought I'd wiped you out.

163
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:14,556
Gail, I'll handle this!

164
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,131
Fine.

165
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:21,161
B-ko!

166
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:31,206
C-ko!

167
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,650
What are you doing?

168
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,662
Shut up! I always
knew you were an idiot!

169
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:56,168
Who's an idiot? Oh, I get it!
You finally found a man!

170
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,531
What's that?

171
00:14:57,637 --> 00:15:02,040
You lecher, you pervert!
You lewd, degenerate slut!

172
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,802
What was that?

173
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:15,379
Lady Xena, hear my call.

174
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,385
Lady Xena, NOW!

175
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:32,099
You always do this!
Remember, three years ago?

176
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:35,137
At that Zero-G
party on Beeten,

177
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:37,799
you wore that
stupid artificial aura!

178
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:42,139
Oh, yeah? What about my
boyfriend, ten years ago?

179
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:46,648
You ruined that pretty quick,
when you broke his arms and legs!

180
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:48,148
Gail is --

181
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,809
Shut up!

182
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,716
Die, A-ko!

183
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,579
They're fighting again.

184
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,215
What a healthy specimen.

185
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,954
Gail, we're leaving.

186
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,890
Don't hurt me!

187
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,833
Ouch!

188
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:28,636
B-ko!

189
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:37,143
Oh no!

190
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:10,872
That bastard, Gail!
He was planning to kill us!

191
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:12,347
Grash!

192
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,364
A-ko...

193
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:34,231
What are you
going to do now?

194
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:40,574
Are you still going to shoot me
in the back, once I drop my guard?

195
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,513
Whatever your intentions once were,
there's only one path left to you.

196
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:50,244
You must join me.
That is your destiny.

197
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:53,348
My destiny?

198
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:13,238
Mr. Chairman, the
reinforcements have arrived.

199
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,107
I'll hit them head on. When they
draw back, you hit their flanks.

200
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:28,413
We'll rescue C-ko.

201
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,715
Attack!

202
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:55,033
This won't even warm me up,
but I'll destroy them anyway.

203
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,114
Daddy's coming, C-ko!

204
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,488
Xena aura!

205
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:26,130
What is it?

206
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:27,298
It's a monster!

207
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:55,560
You're awake.

208
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:57,132
Where are we?

209
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,430
Inside my spaceship.

210
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:03,373
Where's the dragon?
Where's B-ko?

211
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,413
I'm soooo tired!

212
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:27,689
Just kidding. How long
until we reach the test site?

213
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:28,694
About three hours.

214
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:34,863
I'll just take a
teeny nap until then.

215
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,239
What's this?

216
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:47,008
This is his handiwork!

217
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:53,150
They're all dead! The dragon
destroyed the Kotobuki fleet!

218
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,117
A dragon?

219
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:59,282
We're in hot pursuit of Gail now.
There's no time for a rescue.

220
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,360
But we can't
just leave them!

221
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:05,056
We have to stop Gail --
before it's too late!

222
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:09,533
- But there's time for a rescue!
- Hypocrite.

223
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:14,170
Leave us. C-ko is
all that matters!

224
00:22:14,273 --> 00:22:16,400
Save my daughter!
Save C-ko!

225
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,236
That's why we're here.

226
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:20,743
Is that true?
Please, save C-ko!

227
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:23,905
I'd give anything to
have my daughter back!

228
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:26,210
Really? Anything?

229
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,517
She's my
adopted daughter.

230
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:32,054
We found her ten years
ago, drifting in space.

231
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:39,553
But she means more to me
than any daughter could!

232
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:45,594
Perhaps C-ko belongs to the
same race as Gail and Xena.

233
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:48,329
She may even share
his ancestral powers.

234
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:51,531
Perhaps that's
why Gail had her --

235
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,601
A huge reward --
maybe a million!

236
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:57,439
No, maybe... A BILLION!

237
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:00,605
I'll get the Galactic
Citizenship award,

238
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:04,708
and I'll be buried under
marriage proposals.

239
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,014
Lifelong luxury!

240
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:09,850
What about B-ko?

241
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:14,592
Since Xena has taken
over C-ko's body,

242
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:19,224
it may be necessary
to kill the girl.

243
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,901
Xena aura!

244
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:01,532
Prince Road
Buri-Buri Tissue!

245
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:03,699
Don't call me that!

246
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:06,708
A monster! A
preposterously huge dragon!

247
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,278
He's already eaten
the entire army!

248
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:11,142
What?

249
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,844
Such a beautiful sight.

250
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,817
It's hard to believe that it
once held so much degeneracy.

251
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,355
Lady Xena, we must
now go to Talho Sector.

252
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:42,726
No, no! I wanna blow up
more planets! Boom!

253
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:44,458
Lady Xena!

254
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,557
Yes, you're right.

255
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:49,637
Set course for
the Talho Sector.

256
00:25:56,076 --> 00:26:00,012
Galactic listeners, it
looks like all hope is lost.

257
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:04,983
The dragon can devour
entire suns in a single gulp.

258
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:09,954
What are you waiting for? You're
still traveling at sub-light!

259
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:12,957
We'll never catch
them, at this speed!

260
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:16,790
Sorry. I think the engines
were clogged with sand,

261
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:19,865
but they seem
to be okay now.

262
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:21,956
Okay, then,
warp already!

263
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,591
I don't have a warp drive.

264
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:28,464
You can't warp? How do
you expect to catch them?

265
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:32,101
I do not require such
primitive methods.

266
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:38,715
What's that?

267
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:41,979
Warp drive is for
primitive barbarians.

268
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:46,113
In our distant past, my people
constructed hyperspatial bypasses.

269
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,754
Is this safe?

270
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:55,925
Before I joined the Space
Patrol, I wanted to be a racer!

271
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:56,999
Really?

272
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,499
Yeah. In kindergarten.

273
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,249
I'm sure B-ko was just
trying to follow C-ko.

274
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:21,786
But she might have fallen for
Gail's good looks and charm.

275
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,949
You think so? But he
killed her once, already.

276
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:29,495
I've seen all types. Some women
are attracted to dangerous men.

277
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:33,555
I never understood that.

278
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:38,628
Women are strange. They ignore
noble and decent men, like myself.

279
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:42,174
Instead, they fall for
the villains, like him.

280
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,803
I don't get it.

281
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:47,375
A-ko?

282
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:52,808
You're trapped in a tiny ship,
with an eligible bachelor.

283
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:56,547
Doesn't it make you
feel... romantic?

284
00:27:57,923 --> 00:27:59,083
Dummy.

285
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,774
What are you looking at?

286
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:24,040
The shattered remains of planets.
It's a terrible sight.

287
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:27,881
What are the lives
of a billion heretics?

288
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:30,713
Most of them
were fine people.

289
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,980
That's just the problem.

290
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:38,454
They work themselves to
death, just to get by.

291
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,791
They put their trust in greedy
leaders, who wage petty wars,

292
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:46,890
and each side believes that
THEY are the only victims.

293
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:52,439
They're pathetic creatures, heading
farther down their doomed path.

294
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,373
Soon, all that will end.
Once we reach the Talho Sector,

295
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:59,912
you'll see more than
just a few dying planets.

296
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:03,739
The destruction of every
universe in existence!

297
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,045
Every universe?

298
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,451
Infinite possibilities exist.

299
00:29:10,022 --> 00:29:13,423
This universe is
plunging toward corruption.

300
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:17,518
But the dragon allows total
control over all possibilities.

301
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:24,431
They'll all be drawn together,
and a new universe will be born.

302
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,260
Even if you
could do that --

303
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:29,533
- We can.
- Nobody will be left alive.

304
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:34,201
Don't worry. Souls
cannot be destroyed.

305
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:36,541
The universe is limited:

306
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:40,810
there is finite matter and energy,
both space and time are bounded.

307
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:45,211
Only souls exist in the
realm of the infinite.

308
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:49,382
The possible universes contain
countless copies of both of us.

309
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:53,724
But in all those universes,
souls stem from a single source.

310
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:58,162
You might even meet
one of your counterparts.

311
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:03,236
When the universes combine
and then explode out again,

312
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:05,238
the souls will be unharmed.

313
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,969
The soul exists in the domain of a
God that transcends mere universes.

314
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:14,343
Souls? God? Where did you
come across this belief?

315
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:18,013
This isn't a belief,
it's the truth.

316
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:26,583
I feel it. It's as if someone
told it to me, long ago.

317
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,056
Sister!

318
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,825
Ever since you shot me,
I keep seeing a nun.

319
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,336
A nun?

320
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,937
Gail!

321
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,777
This isn't --

322
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:54,350
Gail, don't!

323
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,284
Gail!

324
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,688
Gail!

325
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:07,891
B-ko...

326
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:11,527
You must believe me.

327
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:35,550
A-ko, look at that!
Over there.

328
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,999
Lady Xena,

329
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,591
Do you realize
what you're saying?

330
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:53,570
No! No! No! I wanna
blow up more stars!

331
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,270
Have you forgotten
our mission?

332
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,004
Is the girl's personality
overwhelming you?

333
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:01,511
What are you saying?

334
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,710
Her body still retains a few
of her mannerisms, that's all.

335
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:06,476
But --

336
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:11,715
Enough! I grow weary. Call me
when we reach the Talho Sector.

337
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:16,788
There's a ship coming up on us
from the aft. What should we do?

338
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,094
B-ko, watch
over Lady Xena.

339
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:50,518
C-ko...

340
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:54,222
Everyone will die.

341
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:05,704
A-ko, we're going in!

342
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:08,001
I'm ready.

343
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:18,716
What's wrong? Why
don't you attack?

344
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:22,685
We seem to have a slight
weapons malfunction.

345
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,185
Let me in there!

346
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:33,491
A Space Patrol ship.

347
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:38,230
Is there no rest? Must
they continue to hound me?

348
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,741
Dodge the beams!

349
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:51,371
I don't know how!
I'm going to ram them!

350
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,327
I'm sorry...

351
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:44,152
Things keep getting worse.

352
00:34:44,263 --> 00:34:45,924
Let's go!

353
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:51,594
Intruders!

354
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,207
A-ko!

355
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,539
Damn you!

356
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:07,811
Look out, A-ko!

357
00:35:46,754 --> 00:35:48,517
You did it!

358
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:52,087
Gail!

359
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:59,591
I should never have
trusted a woman.

360
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:03,167
- Well thanks a lot!
- A-ko, shut up!

361
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,898
Gail, I...

362
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:21,146
Gail!

363
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:33,527
Please Gail, open
your eyes! Please!

364
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:41,664
You fools!

365
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,770
Is this another
hyperspace bypass?

366
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:22,273
No, they aren't
this impressive!

367
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,960
Do you realize? Do you
have any idea where you are?

368
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,402
- What does she mean by that?
- A-ko, look!

369
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,168
The Dragon-god!

370
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:15,584
The Talho Sector.

371
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:22,259
The fabled center of the universe,
where all realities collide!

372
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:26,664
Exactly! Until now, it's only
been spoken of in furtive whispers.

373
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:30,225
We are the first beings
to witness this!

374
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:33,569
As the universe cooled
and galaxies formed,

375
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:38,236
the myriad realities ground against
each other here, in the center.

376
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:42,406
This sector is the balance
point for all realities.

377
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:47,283
And I'm going to use my lovely
dragon to tip that balance.

378
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:50,845
And what do you think
will happen then?

379
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,691
You fiend! Every universe
will collapse in on itself!

380
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,729
This is what Gail
was talking about.

381
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:02,323
I won't DESTROY them,
I'll REBUILD them!

382
00:39:02,434 --> 00:39:06,530
Then I'll be the ruler of this
new universe. No, its GOD!

383
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,404
Don't be absurd! Do you
think you can really do that?

384
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,804
Watch me.

385
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:25,551
It's just a matter of time,
now. You are fortunate.

386
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:29,592
You shall witness the
birth of a new universe!

387
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:32,956
I won't let you
get away with this!

388
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,122
- Forgive me, C-ko!
- You fool!

389
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:45,239
You fool. That sword may
have worked on me before,

390
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,604
but it's useless now!

391
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:52,907
Here we go, Maruten!

392
00:39:54,316 --> 00:40:00,686
If you're so determined to die,
I guess I'll have to kill you!

393
00:40:01,322 --> 00:40:02,721
No!

394
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:05,018
I've got you!

395
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:07,721
Wait, A-ko!

396
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,724
Why'd you stop me, B-ko?

397
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:11,888
Look!

398
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:21,739
What's going on?

399
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:24,502
Maybe she's got indigestion.

400
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,274
That's it! Xena hasn't
finished ingesting C-ko's spirit!

401
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:33,283
And now, C-ko's personality
is surfacing again!

402
00:40:33,385 --> 00:40:38,412
That's it! We still have a
chance to save the universe!

403
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,456
In that case...

404
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:44,187
C-ko, wake up!
It's morning!

405
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:47,354
C-ko, you have to
wake up! Resist Xena!

406
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:50,627
We've got cookies!
Come and get 'em!

407
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:53,965
C-ko, wake up! You're
ten years old today!

408
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,530
Hey, wake up! Please wake up!
I told you to get up, you idiot!

409
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:02,442
Come on, wake up!
Pretty please!

410
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:09,244
This is all because
B-ko betrayed us!

411
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:12,252
I had to get close to C-ko.

412
00:41:12,354 --> 00:41:14,322
You had to get
close to the MAN!

413
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:17,482
You barged in and
ruined everything!

414
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:19,253
So it's MY fault?

415
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,260
Yes, it IS
all your fault!

416
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:25,264
I never told you before,
but you're really a jerk!

417
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,698
It's better than being
stupid and ugly, like you!

418
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:31,430
- Now you've done it!
- Shut your trap!

419
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:32,698
Not now!

420
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:35,240
- Shut up!
- Yeah, shut up!

421
00:41:42,548 --> 00:41:44,743
Atomic Graviton Hammer!

422
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,876
That hurts!

423
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:48,715
Double Spiral Face!

424
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:52,416
Shakobini Comet!
Leather Queen Follow-up!

425
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:58,284
High-line Burrows
Tutu Number-one Kick!

426
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:01,229
Extra Electric
Golden Massage!

427
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:08,398
Stop fighting.

428
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:13,468
Please stop fighting.

429
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:15,909
Be nice to each other.

430
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:47,135
Akagiyama missiles!

431
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,347
A-ko, B-ko, STOP IT!

432
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,657
A-ko and B-ko
are idiots!

433
00:43:38,355 --> 00:43:41,119
It hurts. Help me!

434
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:43,556
Now, A-ko! Kill Xena!

435
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:00,240
Xena, I'll send
you back to hell!

436
00:44:04,212 --> 00:44:07,375
Cut-rate Backstab!

437
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,554
Xena!

438
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,624
Where are we?

439
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,392
I wonder if Xena's dead?

440
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:08,198
If she lived on the minds and
energy of disturbed people,

441
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:12,172
then she's probably not
dead. Neither is he.

442
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,112
B-ko, can I ask
you something?

443
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:24,213
How far did you
get with him?

444
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,117
Nothing happened.

445
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:29,117
Of course not!

446
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:34,624
Nothing happened
... or did it?

447
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:42,093
What? Where?

448
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,003
Where's Maruten?

449
00:45:49,476 --> 00:45:51,307
C-ko!

450
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:52,435
Papa!

451
00:46:05,758 --> 00:46:07,055
How'd you find us?

452
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:11,060
We saw a warpfield wake,
coming in from deep space.

453
00:46:11,162 --> 00:46:15,098
It was predicted to emerge
here, so we waited for it.

454
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,657
Nine days ago, Commander
Maruten of the Space Patrol,

455
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,898
arrived in the Eley system
this same way.

456
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:26,635
Maruten? He's still alive?
And he was a commander!

457
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,938
Yes. Look at this.

458
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:37,151
Commander Maruten
Saves the Universe!

459
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:42,657
Maruten Receives
Galactic Citizen's Award!!

460
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:47,022
What's this?

461
00:46:47,697 --> 00:46:51,632
"Commander Maruten single-
handedly stopped the terrorists."

462
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:55,669
"He defeated their leader Gail,
and rescued three young girls."

463
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,965
I can't believe it!

464
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,572
Then you two
saved my C-ko?

465
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:07,511
That's so magnificent!
How can I ever repay you?

466
00:47:07,614 --> 00:47:11,209
Repay us? Oh, you
don't have to do that!

467
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:17,083
To have C-ko back, I would gladly
sacrifice my entire fortune!

468
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,623
Your entire fortune?

469
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:22,058
In fact, I already did.

470
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:25,619
I spent all my money
on the rescue mission.

471
00:47:25,732 --> 00:47:29,565
Although I can't repay you
in the manner you deserve,

472
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:34,071
please accept one of my products:
some delicious Octopus-on-a-Stick.

473
00:47:34,172 --> 00:47:36,367
Octopus?

474
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:44,310
I've found you, A-ko!

475
00:47:45,716 --> 00:47:49,243
You killed my Grash!

476
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:51,984
You're making a mistake!

477
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:54,648
Calm down! Let's
talk about this!

478
00:47:54,758 --> 00:48:01,459
Shut up! Oh, how
I'll make you suffer!

479
00:48:06,702 --> 00:48:10,103
Whew! That was
a close one!

480
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:16,675
I thought I was going to die!
Hey, you're okay. That's nice.

481
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:21,672
I...

482
00:48:32,692 --> 00:48:34,182
Okay...

483
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:36,558
Let's go find Maruten!

484
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,631
Okay!

485
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:40,700
Let's go!

486
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:45,834
Good luck, A-ko
and B-ko! You-Hoo!

487
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:10,854
My heart is beating fast,
but you know it's not from love.

488
00:49:12,096 --> 00:49:16,863
Today I feel differently
than before yesterday.

489
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:22,534
Into my room, I've fled and locked
the door, crying all alone.

490
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:26,699
Now she has gone,
vanished away into the sunrise.

491
00:49:29,378 --> 00:49:34,144
To keep my weakness
from showing to everyone,

492
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:40,120
Sunglasses now shade
my heart, even so,

493
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:46,127
Standing at every signal light,
she's waving to me in my dreams.

494
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:51,096
Then she escapes
right out of my sight.

495
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:58,430
I just can't put in words
the feelings I have for her.

496
00:49:58,906 --> 00:50:04,400
It's a creepy, happy feeling
that fills me every day!

497
00:50:04,978 --> 00:50:09,915
In a great shaft of light,
an angel threw down to Earth,

498
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:17,819
I am feeling I want to be out
and trying this "new me."

499
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:21,188
Bright and shining!

500
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:32,936
When I put on my new shoes,
I walk outside in the sunlight.

501
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:39,538
And then, summer colored winds
come and blow over me.

502
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:44,711
In a great shaft of light,
an angel threw down to Earth,

503
00:50:44,948 --> 00:50:52,217
I am feeling I want to be out
and meeting the new me.

504
00:50:53,522 --> 00:50:56,855
Right about now,

505
00:50:56,959 --> 00:51:01,396
This is a
small miracle to me.
