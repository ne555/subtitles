00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

16
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,940
Dream.

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,770
A great aspiration that I began
 to hold sometime in the past.

18
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,660
Whether we stumble or fall,
 we never cease to chase after it.

19
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,300
Because...

20
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,070
Because...

21
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,800
Congratulations
on your
Invitational
 Appearance, 
Meiwa Daiichi 
High School

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,250
The First Date  !

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,250
 Episode 41(Final)

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,250
The Pledge For Summer Starts Here !

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,780


26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,750
Tachibana, whom would you like to 
tell first how happy you are right now ?

27
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,770
This way, please !

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,620
This way, also !

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,860
Let's see. 
It's probably my parents.

30
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,520
Man, what a liar.

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,550
Couldn't you have
 said something better ?

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,330
It was a national broadcast, after all.

33
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,510
Hey, you guys should come and cheer for me at the Koushien with Hikari.

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,450
Moron ! When we go there, we'll be on the field !

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,980
We have no business
 in the bleachers !

36
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,810
Right ?

37
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,580
Right !

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,900
I guess.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,970
Manager for the baseball club ?

40
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,050
Yeah. If I ask, 
I'm sure they'll let you.

41
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,200
You can count on me.

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,810
Wait. I'm a member
 of the archery club.

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,340
What ? You aren't going to come and cheer for me ?

44
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,250
Of course I will.
I plan to go to the Koushien, too.

45
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,360
It's no fun just going there, is it ?

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,180
You'll get to stay at the same inn, from marching into Koushien Stadium to game day.

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,970
Right ?

48
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,350
But there are other managers.

49
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, and there are many
 more who want to do it.

50
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,990
Then that's all the more reason.

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,080
What about it ?

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,680
It feels too presumptuous.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,500
I am ?

54
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,110
For me to be a manager.

55
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,580
Do you think so ?

56
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,800
Besides, the manager job isn't something
you can do just because someone asks you.

57
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
Are you mad ?

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
No, not at all.

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,000
Really ?

60
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,870
Really.

61
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,400
Hide-chan.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,030
Hm ?

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,210
Congratulations.

64
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,850
Yeah.

65
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,400
And thanks.

66
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,710
I'll cheer as hard as
 I can at the Koushien.

67
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,670
Yeah.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,590
When I look at your practice swing, it just doesn't seem like you're any good as a hitter.

69
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,760
Shut up.

70
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,200
Hey.

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,690
So are you mad at her ?

72
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,910
No. It's just that I didn't expect her to turn it down, so I was surprised.

73
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,060
What's so surprising about it ?

74
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,780
I mean, don't you think so ?

75
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,100
In junior high...

76
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,800
...she did pretty well as a long-distance runner for the track and field team...

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,150
...but she joined the archery club for trivial reasons like how good the "hakama" looks...

78
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,190
...or how great it probably feels when the arrow hits the target, and stuff.

79
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,700
You wouldn't expect her
 to be that committed to it.

80
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,350
I thought she had 
the same dream as me.

81
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,850
I wonder if she actually loves me.

82
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,700
Hold the bat tight, okay ?

83
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,710
Hey.

84
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,200
Hm ?

85
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,200
If you were a pathetic guy who couldn't show even half of his potential without Hikari...

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,790
...she'd come flying to help you, even if you didn't ask.

87
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,200
Really ?

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,700
It's because she trusts you that she feels safe to leave you be.





89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,120
So I should be a pathetic guy ?

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,760
What kind of a guy is pathetic ?

91
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,370
Um...

92
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,440
What are you doing, Hiro ?

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,000
You should blow your nose. You need to button up, too !

94
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,000
I told you to do your
homework when you got home.

95
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,700
It's fine, Mrs. Kunimi. I'll be 
sure to keep an eye on Hiro.

96
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,240
I'll keep an eye on him.

97
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,300
I'll keep an eye on him.

98
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,900
I'll keep an eye on him. 

99
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,510
It's so pathetic.

100
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,560
So what kind of a
 guy is pathetic, really ?

101
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,970
Well, I don't know if Hikari would fall for that kind of a guy, though.

102
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,530
She's a level-headed girl.

103
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,350
She joined the archery club 
because she had her own ideas.

104
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,250
I'm sure of it.

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,200
She just chose something
 that would allow her to grow.

106
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,510
She's always been 
firm since she was little.

107
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,880
Since she was little ?

108
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,300
Ever since she was
 in elementary school...

110
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,070
...she's wanted to be a sports journalist and she wrote about it in her essay.

111
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,250
You don't seem to take
 her seriously, though.

112
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,000
Hmm...

113
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,580
You guys are alike in that you're both firm and level-headed.

114
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,200
That's why Hikari feels safe with you.

115
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,900
I see. She feels safe 
and leaves me be.

116
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,850
I guess it's better to have her feel safe than think of me as a pathetic guy.

117
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,430
Probably.

118
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,020
Hmm...

119
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,290
Okay, I got it !

120
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,120
Huh ?

121
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,150
I see. She feels safe and 
that's why she leaves me alone.

122
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,090
Now I get it.

123
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,420
When we were teammates, 
I used to love that sound.

124
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,300
But now it's a really
 unpleasant sound.

125
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,650
I feel the same way about the sound Noda's mitt makes when he catches your pitches.

126
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,400
Thanks.

127
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,300
Hiro, I'm going to be
 the best hitter in Japan.

128
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,000
You should become 
the best pitcher in Japan.

129
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,940
And let's meet at the
 Koushien this summer.

130
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,100
Yeah.

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,200
I can share that dream with you.

132
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,550
I'm here.

133
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,650
I'm here at the Koushien.

134
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,080
It starts here, Hide-chan.

135
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,750
Yup, it's perfect.

136
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,100
It's flying away !

137
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,540
It's gone.

138
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,250
Is it going ?

139
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,150
I said it's gone.

140
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,200
And it's gone ! A homerun !

141
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,100
One of the noteworthy
 players of this tournament...

142
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,670
...Tachibana Hideo from Meiwa Ichi High School, a second-year player hitting fourth.

143
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,250
He makes his Koushien debut with a huge homerun to the middle of the left field stands.

144
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,650
Well, life is pain.

145
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't be blinded by the temporary spotlight
and lose sight of yourself, okay, Hide-chan ?

146
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:23,080
He hit it really well. He's going to be a tremendous force...

147
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,750
Ah, how frustrating.

148
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,730
Hey...

149
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,950
If you get ahead of yourself now, you won't last till summer.

150
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,530
Hideo is getting ahead, 
hitting a big one at the Koushien.

151
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,530
Kunimi !

152
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,170
Newspaper people
 want to interview you !

153
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,320
So can we have a comment from you as a representative of Tachibana Hideo's friends ?

154
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,490
What ?!

155
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,190
Tachibana ?!

156
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,150
Hold it right there !

157
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,550
Let me speak about Tachibana !

158
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,550
When we were in
 elementary school...

159
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,950
...he and I competed for the cleanup hitter spot on the Hakusan Angels !

160
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,200
Without my genius, Tachibana would not have become who he is now !

161
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,630
Did Tachibana say something
 before he went to the Koushien ?

162
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,630
Hey ! You ! Listen to me !

163
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,130
Shimada.

164
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:36,940
Yes ?

165
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,980
Could you take
 a few photos of him ?

166
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,610
Oh, but all we needed was his comment.
They said we didn't need any photos.

167
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,270
The editors said there was no need for a photo.

168
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,730
Doesn't matter. 
Please do it anyway.

169
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,460
I'm sure we'll need them 
some time down the road.

170
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,810
Okay.

171
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,080


172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,950

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,400
In his first-at bat, a homerun to
the middle of the left-field stands.
A hero makes a flashy debut at 
the Koushien.

180
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,270
Hmm.

181
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,910
Hmm.

182
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,330
Hide-chan is amazing.

183
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,000
This is nothing, given his talent.

184
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,600
If you feel frustrated, you should make your way into the newspaper, too.

185
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm in it already.

186
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,600
Huh ?

187
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,550
Where ?

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
"Friend A" ?

189
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,590
"He had always been on a different level than us."

190
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,150
"For us, the Koushien is
 a dream within a dream."

191
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,900
"But for Tachibana, it's just the 
first step in his baseball career."

192
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,700
"I'm proud of the fact that I was once Tachibana's teammate."

193
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,990
Who said anything like this ?!

194
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,150
Hello.

195
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,000
Hello.

196
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,010
Is this the home of "Friend A" ?

197
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,990
Hey...!

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Koushien

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Stadium

200
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,920
Hiro, the Koushien is amazing.

201
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,450
Huh ?

202
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,000
Because it's amazing, way too amazing, you have to see it with your own eyes.

203
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,630
What are you talking about ?

204
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,480
Work hard, and come here this summer.

205
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,270
This summer, come 
to the Koushien, Hiro.

206
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,350
Yeah.

207
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,840
Well, the second-round game is starting.

208
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,850
Hit it, hit it, Tachibana !

209
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,500
Hit it, hit it, Tachibana !

210
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,940
Hit it, hit it, Tachibana !

211
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,510
Hit it, hit it, Tachibana !

212
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,100
Hit it, hit it, Tachibana !

213
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,800
Hit it, hit it, Tachibana !

214
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,030
You looked at the fastball up and in.

215
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,470
In the batter's box is Tachibana Hideo, 
the slugger from powerhouse Meiwa Ichi.

216
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,650
Now, on the mound is 
Senkawa's ace pitcher, Kunimi.

217
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,350
What will he throw next ?

218
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,120
Am I in the way ?

219
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,000
You were imagining yourself at the Koushien, right ?

220
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,760
You're early. Practice
 doesn't start until afternoon.

221
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,710
As I was watching TV at home, I couldn't sit still.

222
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,700
You, too ?

223
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,220
I guess.

224
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,650


225
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,940
What is it ?

226
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,800
No, nothing, really.

227
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,100
You're weird.

228
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,620
Hey, Hiro !

229
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,220
Hey !

230
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,650
We, the Senkawa Baseball Club, have great team chemistry.

231
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,860
Hey, thanks for the wait !

232
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,200
Genius Kine Ryutarou has arrived !

233
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,350
No one was waiting for you.

234
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,550


235
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,830
Kunimi, let's all go 
together, to the Koushien.

236
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,330
Yeah, including you.

237
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,100
Well, let's do some work !

238
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,330
I...

239
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,880
...hate high school baseball.

240
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,290
Principal...

241
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,540
I can't focus on my work.

242
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,550
I see.

243
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,000
In summer, it'll
 probably get even worse.

244
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,700
I can totally guarantee that.

245
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,400
Homerun !

246
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,700
Right at the back screen...

247
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,400
...a three-run homer to even up the score, coming back from a hopeless situation.

248
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,700
Listen to the crowd cheering.

249
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,300
With their back against the 
wall in the bottom of the ninth...

250
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,650
...Tachibana's homerun sends this game into the third extra inning game of this tournament.

251
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,040
It's hot.

252
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,050
My chest feels hot.

253
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,650
The passionate feelings turn into cheers...

254
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,090
...and it becomes a big swell 
that envelopes the Koushien.

255
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,190
The voices, the commotion...

256
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,980
It's amazing.
It really is amazing, Hiro.

257
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,000
The Koushien unites everyone.

258
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,000
Come.

259
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,670
Come here, Hiro.

260
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,800
Kunimi.

261
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,730
It must be hard on him now.

262
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,000
It must be hard on him with his friend getting one step closer to his dream.

263
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,000
But...

264
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,270
You're not alone. 
You have all these teammates.

265
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,160
The seniors are improving.

266
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah, they're all working hard.

267
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,360
They love baseball so much that they initially formed the baseball fan club.

268
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,110
Maybe I did a bad thing.

269
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,060
What ?

270
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,250
That was fun in its
 own way, after all.

271
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,920
From now on, it'll get
 harder and harder for them.

272
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,090
If they had remained just friends...

273
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,700
If they had remained just friends,
 it would have continued to be fun.

274
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,800
The more you love, the more pain and hardship you have to endure.

275
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,450
Even if that's the case...

276
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,200
Even if that's the case, 
people still fall in love.

277
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,530
I see.

278
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,350
After all, we're trying to get a date with the Koushien...

279
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,550
...whom 4000 schools across the nation are going after.

280
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,190
That's a huge love romance !

281
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Youkou" on top, "Meiwa Ichi" on bottom; innings, "11 12 13 14 15 16 17

282
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Youkou" on top, "Meiwa Ichi" on bottom; innings, "11 12 13 14 15 16 17

283
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Youkou" on top, "Meiwa Ichi" on bottom; innings, "11 12 13 14 15 16 17

284
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,200
Youkou

285
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,200
Meiwa Ichi

286
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,200
11

287
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,200
12

288
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,200
13

289
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,920
The game is decided in the thirteenth inning, with the score of 4-3.

290
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,300
Much to their disappointment, 
Meiwa Ichi did not advance to the semi-finals.

291
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,700
They lost, with Tachibana in the on-deck circle.

292
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,200
But honestly, it was a tough battle.

293
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,650
With just a matter 
of a few centimeters...

294
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,400
...the winning run was scored, and 
that was the difference in the game.

295
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,050
Hiro, we'll both be
 here this summer.

296
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,950
As the best hitter in Japan,
and the best pitcher in Japan.

297
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,170
We'll face off in the summer.

298
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,120
It's only just beginning.

299
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,200
Yeah !

300
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,000
What're you doing, discouraging your own team during free-style batting practice ?

301
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,200
Sorry about that.

302
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,170
Kunimi, do you remember
 when we met for the first time ?

303
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,550
"What are you burning ?"

304
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,860
"It's the springtime of my youth."

305
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,000
That's what you answered.

306
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,970
I don't know of anyone
 who'd answer like that.

307
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,350
You run straight toward your goal, with all you've got.

308
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,900
I wanted to chase after you.

309
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,930
Now, and from now on.

310
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,100
Why do I play baseball ?

311
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,540
Why do I aim for the Koushien ?

312
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,250
Because I love it.

313
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,600
I want to meet baseball 
at my beloved Koushien.

314
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,900
I just want to meet her.

315
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,500
Isn't that enough of a reason ?

316
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,610
I have no complaints !

317
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,330
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

318
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:03,510
No matter how loud the cheers become...

319
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:12,700
...I can still tell it's your voice.

320
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,300
Even if you get a hit, or make an out...

321
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:20,200
Instead of answering you...

322
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,950
...win or lose, I won't be broken.

323
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,700
I will move forward again.

324
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,650
...without artifice or affectation...

325
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,900
Because that's how you find a dream.

326
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,600
...I'll throw a fastball right down the middle.

327
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

328
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,050
Yes, pursue, and continue to pursue...

329
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,900
I cower in fear, but...

330
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,100
...and you can find it.

331
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,270
That's what a dream is.

332
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,650
One down, two down.

333
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,100
I can say it now, in raw words.

334
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,490
Hiro, I'll become the best hitter in Japan.

335
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,900
Embracing the red-hot courage...

336
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,340
You become the best pitcher in Japan !

337
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,200
And I'll see you at the Koushien this summer !

338
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,200
...let's smash it into the clouds.

339
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,940
I can definitely share that dream with you !

340
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It's a rainbow Grand Slam !

341
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,120
It's a rainbow Gland Slam !

342
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:09,300
And

343
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,300
it all

344
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,300

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,950
...I want to get past a hardship like that.

00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:36,750
Like you, I run up the pedestrian bridge...

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:39,260
Notes:
A "hakama" is the divided skirt-like pants that Japanese archery, kendo, etc. players wear.

 The Senkawa team during the end. I didn't want to dirty the screen up. The first number is when they bat and the second number is their uniform number:
 1 - Kine 8, 2 - Yanagi 4, 3 - Kunimi 1,
4 - Noda 2, 5 - Arikawa 5, 6 - Hironaga 3, 7 - Sagawa 6, 8 - Moritani 7, 9 - Tanaka 9

353
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:45,180
...keeping up with the sunny sky, I want to feel courageous.

354
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:46,090
Notes:
If you want to see what happens from the end of this episode on start watching the H2 Live Action release. Watch it from the beginning. It covers nearly everything - 
from episode 1 of this series all the way to the end 
of the manga.

"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

361
00:22:52,220 --> 00:23:00,530
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

362
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,830
"I'm definitely glad we met."

363
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,650
Let's stay strong and move forward.

364
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,380
When I'm by myself I notice...

365
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,330
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

366
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,130
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

367
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,380
...there are more and more smiles.

368
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,830
Just by looking at you, see ?

369
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,930
My eyes will look kinder.
