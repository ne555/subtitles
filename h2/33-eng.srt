1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,800
Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,700
Eikyou's ace pitcher, Hirota
 Katsutoshi, hit Hideo with a pitch.

17
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,210
But in his next at-bat, Hideo gets a hit 
off him despite having a fractured arm.

18
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,200
Seeing how great Hideo was, we resolved our small disagreement.

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,750
Senkawa Festival

21
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,750
Welcome, Eikyou High School

22
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,960


23
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,750
This is an announcement.

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,250
Those on the Senkawa
 Festival Executive Committee...

25
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,850
...please report to the 
Biology Room immediately.

26
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,200
I repeat.

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Those on the Senkawa 
Festival Executive Committee...

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,100
Senkawa Festival

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,300
...please report to the
 Biology Room immediately.

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,800
Baseball Club

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,300
An invitational game ?

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,820
We're playing baseball 
during the cultural festival ?

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,950
Yeah.

34
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,510
I thought it would be a great opportunity to meet girls from other schools...

35
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,550
Don't worry about that.

36
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,450
It's not like we'll play 
the game all day long.

37
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,900
It's just one game. 
After that, you're free.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,170
That's good.

39
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,450
So who's our opponent ?

40
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,000
Now don't be shocked when you hear !

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,300
It's...

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,530
Hold it for a second !

43
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,350
I have a bad feeling about this.

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,960
Don't tell me our opponent is going to be Meiwa again ?

45
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,800
Close !

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,600
It's Eikyou.

47
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,230
Yanagi.

48
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,900
Huh ?

49
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,320
What exactly is your father ?

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,000
Huh ?

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,550
What do you mean, "huh" ?

52
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,610
You couldn't normally get Eikyou to come
 over as an attraction for a cultural festival.

53
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,590
Oh, that ?

54
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,150
It wasn't him. 
They requested it.

55
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,650
You're lying.

56
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,230
Unless they commit 
a crime or something...

57
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,230
...they'll be going to the
 Spring Invitational next year.

58
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,950
Why would a team like that 
come all the way over here ?

59
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,900
They probably want to check you out.

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,580
Why ?

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,750
I heard that Eikyou's Coach Shiroyama...

62
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,700
...has been interested in him
 since Kunimi's junior high years.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,450
Coach Shiroyama ?

64
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,150
Yeah.

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,190
His career highlights include one spring 
and two summer Koushien championships.

66
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,520
He's the famous coach who took the field manager position at Eikyou last year.

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,170
Oh, that old guy.

68
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,440
Come to think of it, he gave me a call when I was in junior high.

69
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,000
What ?

70
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,190
This is the first time
I've heard about it !

71
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,010
What did that famous
 coach say to you ?

72
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,000
He said, "Why don't we go
 to the Koushien together ?"

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,130
And...?

74
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,600
I turned him down, of course.

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,200
It goes without saying !

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,500
If it's with a cute girl, 
that's one thing...

77
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,550
...but why would I want to go to the Koushien with an old guy like him ?

78
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,140
That's not what he meant...

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,100
Well, whatever the case...

80
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,650
...he learned that we'd be in the same 
block, and that our ace pitcher is Kunimi.

81
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,550
So I guess he wanted
the chance to see you.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,660
So they want to scout him.

83
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,710
I'm flattered.

84
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,620
What are we going to do ?

85
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,300
Let's see.

86
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,960
We don't need to worry an elder unnecessarily.

87
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,060
It's just going to be
a part of the festivities.

88
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,200
It doesn't matter if we win or lose.

89
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,780
It's better if they'd just overlook us, rather than tightening their guard against us.

90
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,140
That's right.

91
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,000
We should make our guests feel good about themselves as they head home.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,910
I don't have any complaints as long as the game ends before the folk dance starts.

93
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,500
There's no need
 to worry about that.

94
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,450
Are they serious ?

95
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,550
Who knows ?

96
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,330
All right !

97
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,650
Eikyou High School

98
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,150
Eikyou High School

99
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,540
Is that the fastest pitch
 the machine can throw ?

100
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,200
Yes.

101
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,050
Then move up it two meters.

102
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,960
What ?

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,410
Two meters closer.

104
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,650
This is going to be a problem.

105
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,530
It's going to be a problem.

106
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,270
Why did you do that ?

107
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,210
It's going to be a problem.

108
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,800
I heard you.

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,760
Then you should respond.

110
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,940
Then you should just tell us
 without waiting for a response.

111
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,110
Oh well, you sure are one to talk.

112
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,800
You have no room to talk.

113
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,370
The baseball club is playing a
 game for the cultural festival, right ?

114
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,410
Yeah.

115
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,600
To tell the truth, the 
soccer club has a game, too.

116
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,790
Plus, it's at the same
 time as the baseball club's.

117
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,600
Really ?

118
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,260
Yeah. If I had two bodies, there'd be no problem.

119
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,030
Good luck.

120
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,640
Thanks.

121
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Huh ? Hey !

122
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,000
So, I mean...

123
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,800
Is the Soccer Club done 
with practice, too ?

124
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,400
Koga...

125
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,380
To tell the truth, there's a problem.

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,830
The Soccer Club is playing an invitational game, too, right ?

127
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, you knew ?

128
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,650
As the ace striker of the soccer club, I have to play the game.



129
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,950
But if you insist...

130
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,550
You don't have to force yourself.

131
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,430
Huh ?

132
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,930
They don't intend to win anyway.

133
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,650
Really ?

134
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,690
But if you insist...

135
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,750
I can't come cheer for you, 
but good luck with the game.

136
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,510
Koga...

137
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,600
So, I mean...

138
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,050
You don't have to come with me to the hospital anymore.

139
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,500
Why not ?

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000
It's embarrassing. I'm a guy.

141
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,350
Then how about I wait for you outside the hospital ?

142
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,850
Well...

143
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,770
That's fine.

144
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,410
Oh ?

145
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,930
Shuu.

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,810
Yo.

147
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,200
What are you doing, standing there ?

148
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,560
You could have
 gone in and waited.

149
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,100
Liquor and Food:
Tachibana

150
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,100
I just came to buy coffee and a nighttime snack.

151
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,660
Thanks for your business.

152
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,710
How's your arm ?

153
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,200
It's not a big deal.

154
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,410
We don't have to play any 
games for a while, anyway.

155
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,960
I have time to heal.

156
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,550
Man, it's amazing.

157
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,230
You hit a homerun with that arm.

158
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,640
I'm insensitive to pain, I guess.

159
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,650
Anyway, you were right 
not to take that last at-bat.

160
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,340
Huh ?

161
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,150
Oh, yeah. About the money I 
borrowed from you the other day...

162
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,100
You don't have to worry about it.

163
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,680
Ironically, I'm busy studying for the entrance exam.

164
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,800
I don't need any money for recreation right now.

165
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,320
See you.

166
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,700
Is your studying going well ?

167
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,340
No need to worry about that.

168
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,810
With all the fistfights I've had, 
I've become great at focusing.

169
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,500
His hands...

170
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,800
Did they have calluses from holding a pen and studying too much ?

171
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,890
Yeah.


172
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,730
Brother, you're going
 straight home today, right ?

173
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,030
Give me a ride home, then.

175
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,770
Sure.

176
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,000
Koga !

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,660
Do you want to go eat some yakisoba ?

178
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,490
Take these. Thanks.

179
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,060
Hey, Little Sister...

180
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,450
Sagawa

181
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,910
Hello.

182
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,510
Were you sleeping ?

183
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,650
I'm studying for the 
entrance exam, you know ?

184
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,650
I was just taking a break.

185
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,770
You were doing practice swings ?

186
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,210


187
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,320
So you did continue to play baseball.

188
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,450
Yeah. So what's up ?

189
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

190
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,070
Do you want to go to Senkawa this Sunday for their cultural festival ?

191
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,640
I told you, I'm studying for the exam.

192
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,650
I'm just saying, give
 yourself some time off.

193
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,600
Their baseball club is
 playing an invitational game.

194
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,250
It's going to be an interesting game.

195
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,400
Okay. So who's the opponent ?

196
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,090
Eikyou High School.

197
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,170
... !

198
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,050
Hello ?

199
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,710
I think I'll pass. Bye.

200
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,400
Shuu !

201
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,490
That's a problem, Sagawa.

202
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,620
If you want to play baseball at this 
school, you should do what I tell you.

203
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,840
Hirota...!

204
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,600


205
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,770
Aim for the Koushien

206
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,290


207
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,670
Aim for the Koushien

208
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,710
If...

209
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,800
If we defeat Eikyou 
in the upcoming game...

210
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,090
...we'll be thought of as one of 
the elite teams, don't you think ?

211
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,000
They're going to the Spring 
Invitational next year, after all.

212
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,500
It doesn't matter. I don't
 intend to beat them anyway.

213
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,040
Right ?

214
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,700
That's right.

215
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,650
 How to finish the game 
before the folk dance starts...

216
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,850
...is the biggest task for us in our game against Eikyou.

217
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,870
I mean, they played a tough game against Meiwa.

218
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,570
No matter how you look at it, there's no way we can defeat them as it is.

219
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,500
If that's what you're concerned about, we almost beat Meiwa, too.

220
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,890
Yeah, that was a good game.

221
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,650
It began with my hit that scored the first run of the game.

222
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,550
Then there was my 
super defensive play.

223
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,480
Then, in the ninth inning, with two outs, 
we closed the gap to one run with my RBI hit.

224
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,630
It was a great game.




225
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,000
When I think about it...

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
...my defensive play
 got us out of a jam...

227
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,400
...and my bat put all 
our runs on the board.

228
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,270
Yeah.

229
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,450
Why are you wearing 
a baseball uniform ?

230
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,280
What are you talking about, Koga ? I'm a baseball club member, too !

231
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,350
I know, but you hardly
 ever come to practice.

232
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,550
Yeah, that's the issue.

233
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,100
This time, too, if only 
I could play the game...

234
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,630
...we could easily defeat 
any team, including Eikyou.

235
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,030
But we have a soccer game, too.

236
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,600
I really feel terrible about it.

237
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,050
I'm the key cog of 
the offense and defense.

238
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,000
Without me, there's no 
way our team can win.

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,650
Kine.

240
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,100
Hm ?

241
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,900
Don't worry about it.

242
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,980
Eikyou's goal for this game
 is to gather data on our team.

243
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,700
Do you think we can afford to
 let you play in a game like that ?

244
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,900
What do you mean ?

245
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,650
You're the key cog of 
our offense and defense.

246
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,150
 We'll keep you under 
the radar until next year.

247
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,300
In other words, 
you're our secret weapon.

248
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,800
Secret weapon...?

249
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,430
Yeah.

250
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,000
Kunimi !

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,890
Good luck with your soccer game.

252
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,920
I'll do my best !

253
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,890
Okay, let's do some road work !

254
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,550
Sure !

255
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,450
I'll go with you, Kunimi !

256
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,350
I'm the secret weapon.

257
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,650
Huh ?

258
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,210
I feel there's something amiss...

259
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,990
But I'm a little disappointed.

260
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,120
About what ?

261
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,980
Don't you kind of think we can win ?

262
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,910
You're still talking about that ?

263
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,760
I mean, your fastball is 
faster than the Eikyou pitcher's.

264
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,370
Don't you think, Noda ?

265
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,530
You don't need to be impatient. You'll find out when next summer comes.

266
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,450
Rather, the most important thing is to
 finish the game before the folk dance starts.

267
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,690
You could win and finish 
the game before the folk dance.

268
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,220
I'm telling you !


269
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,550
I know, I know.

270
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,700
It's better not to give them much information until we play them in a real game, right ?

271
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,020
That's right.


272
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:35,630
Oh well. Kunimi throws
 harder than Eikyou's pitcher.

273
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,650
Take it easy today.

274
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,530
You're pitching in the game the day after tomorrow.

275
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,150
You're using your ace pitcher for an 
exhibition game at a cultural festival ?

276
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,030
We asked for the game. 
We can't be disrespectful.

277
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,380
I see.

278
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,730
Coach, is it true that a pitcher you wanted before you recruited me is at Senkawa ?

279
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,650
That pitcher throws so hard...

280
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,000
...that you have to move the machine
 two meters closer to prepare for him ?

281
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,550
Are you jealous ?

282
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,650
I don't like to hear
 other people being praised.

283
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,150
Because I couldn't get him, I may be overvaluing him.

284
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,980
As they say, the fish that got away is always big.

285
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,290
From time to time, you should feed the fish you caught.

286
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,650
I know. If I leave you alone, you might eat each other.



287
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Senkawa Festival

288
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,950
Senkawa Festival

289
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,650
Oh, Eikyou is coming ?

290
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,960
That's impressive !

291
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:25,250
Next Year's Spring Invitational
Candidate, Eikyou High School, 
Led by the Famous
Coach Shiroyama, Is Coming !!
Game Starts at 1: 00 PM,
Senkawa Baseball Club

292
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,830
We might be able to meet Hirota !

293
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,610
It starts at 1 PM. Let's go there !

294
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,650
It'll be fun !

295
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,900
Oh, the soccer club plays a game, too ?

296
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,400
But it's such a shame !
Both games start at 1 PM.

297
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,650
No-Name School Comes !

298
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,650
Soccer Club
Invitational Game.

299
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,650
Kickoff at 1 PM

300
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,200
I want to watch baseball, 
but I can't miss the soccer game !

301
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,170
This is the era of soccer !

302
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,750
I totally agree with you !

303
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,820
Yeah, yeah. 
Baseball is so tacky !

304
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,250
Where are you looking ?
 We're right here !

305
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,730
I think we have a 
similar outlook on life.

306
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,950
Really.

307
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,550
Now, let's go.

308
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,480
Please buy us some mitsumame.

309
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,030
Ladies, do you have older sisters...?

310
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,840
Good luck, Kine !

311
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,950
We're pulling for you !

312
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,400
Welcome, Eikyou High School






Senkawa Festival Baseball Club Invitational Game

313
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,810
I guess the names of "Eikyou" and 
"Coach Shiroyama" are powerfully magnetic.

314
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:03,000
They get to watch the stars of the Koushien who will appear on TV next spring, after all.

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,650
Anyway, it's a matter of 
how we'll lose the game.

316
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,580
I don't want us to be a laughingstock.

317
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,710
What happened to the 
Soccer Club's invitational match ?

318
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, if we keep it within a five-run gap, it won't make us look too bad.

319
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,450
What happened to the Soccer Club's invitational match ?

320
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
Hirota !

321
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,630
Look this way !


322
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,900
He's so popular.

323
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,500
Only until next summer.

324
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,580
Once summer comes, I'll 
monopolize all the girls in Japan.

325
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,270
That's right.

326
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,500
Silly, don't take me seriously.

327
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,380
Tachibana !

328
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,690
Give us an autograph !

329
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,540
Tachibana...

330
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,340
The pinstripes don't look good on an evil person like you.

331
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,760
Sagawa...





332
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm looking forward to seeing your advance declaration of strikeouts.

333
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,270
Oh, yes.

334
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,510
Can you also tell me what you do for an advance declaration of a hit-by-pitch ?

335
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,620


336
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,860
The fish that got away...

337
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,120

355
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:59,980
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

356
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,280
"I'm definitely glad we met."

357
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,100
Let's stay strong and move forward.

358
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,830
When I'm by myself I notice...

359
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,780
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

360
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,580
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

361
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,830
...there are more and more smiles.

362
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,280
Just by looking at you, see ?

363
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,380
My eyes will look kinder.

Next Episode

365
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,480
The fated match against Eikyou High School finally begins, Hiro.

366
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,240
We're a no-name school. I have no intention of giving them any data.

367
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,810
You don't intend to win ?



368
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,110
There's more to baseball 
games than just winning or losing.

369
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,430
You say so, but you always get 
worked up when you give up a hit.

370
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,660
There's no pitcher who
 enjoys giving up hits.

371
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,980
See ? You got angry.

372
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,150

377
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,730
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

378
