0:09:20.00 0:09:21.00  because Kine's mannerism resembles that of that clan.}

15
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,050
Now, the 27th hitter is also cornered by
Kunimi, the first year pitcher on the mound.

16
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,400
As he beholds the sky, what is going through his mind ?

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Two outs in the ninth inning.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,150
That's right.

19
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,350
In other words, it's a perfect game.

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,800
One more batter for a perfect game.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,540
Will this be the final pitch of the game ?

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,450
Now, Kunimi will put everything
he has into this one pitch.

23
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,000
He goes into the windup.

24
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,940
And throws.

25
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,750
Hiro !

26
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,830
Hey, Mister.

27
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,900
It's not nice of you
to do stuff like that.

28
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,050
Oh, you play baseball ?

29
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,610
No wonder you have such good control.

30
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,380
But what's a young guy doing here
by himself on such a sunny day ?

31
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,300
The baseball boy isn't
popular with girls, I guess.

32
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,840
Right now, soccer is trendier.

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,650
Hey...

34
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,820
It's okay. Young people 
shouldn't make excuses.

35
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,610
Oh ? Is that a pun ?

36
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,120
We're going to forgive you this time.
But next time, don't spoil kids' fun.

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,010
Geez. Brats these days...

38
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,720
Bye, unpopular baseball guy !

39
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go that way.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All right.

41
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,500
Morons. You don't know, do you ?

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,060
I'm actually popular with girls, you know ?

43
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,640
Oh no ! I thought it was a fire, so I just threw the water !

44
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,070
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,520
You should check more
thoroughly before you do something.

46
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,530
No, Third, stop that !

47
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,810
I'm really sorry.

48
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,550
Oh, it's okay...

49
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,040
Oh, yes. I'll wash your clothes.

50
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,240
Um, again...

51
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,270
What are you burning ?

52
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,890
Hm...

53
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,300
The springtime of my life.

54
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,940
Oh.

55
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,590
Um, Miss, can I have my bucket back ?

56
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,300
Coach, it's unheard of to let a newcomer
have free batting practice right away.

57
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,100
He's special.

58
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,120
Even if he's special, it sets a bad example
for the other eighty club members.

59
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,400
Do you want him to shine your shoes ?

60
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,650
Aim for the Koushien ! 

Tachibana Hideo

61
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,500
Oh ?

62
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,910
No ! Hikari is a pervert !

63
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,800
What are you talking about ?

64
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,140
Did Hideo ask you to do this ?

65
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,600
I just couldn't leave it alone.

66
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,780
I see. This room is sure dirty.

67
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,000
Hide-chan likes to keep things clean.

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,250
But you guys come
in and make it untidy.

69
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Geez. I can't even tell 
which clothes belong to who.

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, the wet ones are mine.

71
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,500
Besides, why are there so many pairs
of pajamas in Hide-chan's room ?

72
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:58,260
Well, back in our junior high days, we used
to talk baseball until dawn in this room.

73
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,000
We were so young back then.

74
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,350
Old man, your treasure is here.

75
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,880
Why do you assume it's mine ?

76
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,670
Then I can throw it away, right ?

77
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,120
It's mine.

78
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,610
Aim for the Koushien !

Tachibana Hideo

79
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,570
Where's Hideo ?
Aim for the Koushien !

Tachibana Hideo

80
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,270
He's at baseball club practice.
Aim for the Koushien !

Tachibana Hideo

81
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,900
Aim for the Koushien !

Tachibana Hideo

82
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,700
During spring break ?

83
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,850
Meiwa Daiichi's baseball club is well-known.

84
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,490
They train hard, even before the entrance ceremony.

85
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,900
Oh.

86
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,800
So he can't be idle during
daytime hours like some person.

87
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,850
That goes for me, too.

88
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,450
You have a date with Hideo, I suppose.

89
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,470
Right. We're going to go 
watch a movie after practice.

90
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,880
In that outfit ?

91
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
Why do you say that ?

92
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,300
Isn't your skirt too short ?

93
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,500
Oh, really ?

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,320
Bye, "some person."

95
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,630
Wow... !

96
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,100
When did you...?

97
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
Are you a ninja or something ?

98
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,400
Goodness, there's another "some person."

99
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,440
I wonder whose room that is.

100
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,700
Honestly, girls are better than sports, right ?

101
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:40,700
This is the catcher from my junior high team, Noda, who quit baseball after he hurt his back.

102
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,120
What's that about ?
Who are you explaining this to ?

103
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,570
Oh, Hiro, that girl looks hot.

104
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,200
Well, long hair isn't my thing.

105
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,750
How about that pair ?

106
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
Well, not really.

107
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,400
How about that girl ?

108
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,800
The one with the short hair.

109
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,330
She looks strong-willed.

110
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,350
Then that girl.

111
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,820
She looks tough.

112
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,160
Flirting ?

113
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,600
Yep. Atsushi is with him, too.

114
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,000
I wonder what's going on in their heads.

115
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,400
But...

116
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,060
But ?

117
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,030
It feels like a waste.

118
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,300
It's not just that it feels like a waste !

119
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,700
There were countless high
schools that wanted him.

120
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,550
Hiro is going to Senkawa High School.

121
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
It doesn't have a baseball club.

122
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,210
Yeah.

123
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,120
That's probably why he chose there.
He didn't want to live with regrets.

124
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,650
But really, he accepted it so fast.

125
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,090
It's not totally clear that
his elbow would break down.

126
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,800
"If he continues to pitch, it will 
definitely break down in three months."

127
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,070
If the doctor says so, it can't be helped.

128
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,520
But you'd choose that path, for sure.

129
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm a fool, after all.

130
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,730
Hiro is a fool, too.

131
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,880
It's nothing.

132
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,140
Well, the movie is going to start.

133
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,890
 Let's go.

134
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,470
How about that girl ?

135
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,020
Oh, those ones are usually fairly old.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,300
Hey there, want to have a cup of tea ?

137
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,850
We're both pairs. How lucky !

138
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,550
Let's part.

139
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,280
What ?

140
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,300
If I stay with you...

141
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,900
...it's probably going to end up being a
totally fun spring break day with just guys.

142
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,570
Sorry about that.

143
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,680


144
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,150
This is why we should have gone separate ways.

145
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,400
Don't blame me for it.

146
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,850
Hiro is much more of a
gourmet than he should be.

147
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,670
Yeah, I have my preferences about fast food places.

148
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,530
That's not what I meant.

149
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,750
So...

150
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,290
No way !

151
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,640
After that, we got summoned by the homeroom teacher.

152
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,340
Ugh, terrible.

153
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,770
That guy is so persistent.

154
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,910
Silly.

155
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,350
You're saying I'm a gourmet ?

156
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,650
No way !

157
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't believe it !

158
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,390
So, when I enroll at Senkawa,
I'm going to join the swimming club.
I can't believe it !

159
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,140
So, when I enroll at Senkawa,
I'm going to join the swimming club.

160
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,790
Swimming ?

161
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,200
Yeah.

162
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,750
From what I hear, swimming is the best for rehabilitation of the back.

163
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,550
Says the doctor.

164
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,080
Yeah, especially the butterfly style. That's the important one.

165
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,700
Hiro, are you going to 
do any club activities...?

166
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,680
Hey, girls. 
Which school are you from ?

167
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,740
Seijo.

168
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,000
How about you ?

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,470
Um, well, Senkawa.

170
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,060
What ?

171
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,220
Senkawa's soccer club is really good.

172
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,070
Um, yeah.

173
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,100
Which club do you belong to ?

174
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,600
Is it soccer ?

175
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,730
Um, yeah.

176
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,390
Oh, are you all soccer fans ?

177
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,300
Yeah.

178
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I was a fan of J-League at first...

179
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,150
...but these days, high
school soccer is more fun.

180
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,710
High school baseball is passé, after all.

181
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,150
Um...I guess that's true.

182
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,200
You are so...

183
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,070
Is that your friend from the soccer club ?

184
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,750
Um, I'm Noda Atsushi.

185
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,150
It was fun.

186
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,730
You love action movies.

187
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,460
Yeah.

188
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,220
You don't actually watch
romance movies, after all.

189
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,560
Action movies make me
feel more energized.

190
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,880
Oh, so that's how it is ?

191
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,670
There's one more thing.

192
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,200
Huh ?

193
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,900
Baseball.

194
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,320
Watching it makes me feel energized.

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,770
I'm glad that I play baseball.

196
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,210
Let's go.

197
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh ?

198
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,250
It really was a fun day.

199
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,760
Good for you.

200
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh...

201
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,070
A movie, huh ?

202
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,700
Oh well. I wish I had done that.

203
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,940
Your flirting didn't go well, it seems.

204
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,600
Moron.

205
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,300
It's the opposite.
We totally won big.

206
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,650
Hitting the bull's eye on all targets. 
We totally had our choices. Aqua green.

207
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,550
Girls were swarming us. And we
dealt with them one after another.

208
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,090
You don't have to act tough.

209
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,040
What ?

210
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
I've got to have some juice.

211
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,900
You're going to get fat.

212
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,020
Thanks for meddling.

213
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,290
Thief !

214
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,600
Somebody, catch him !

215
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,990
Here !

216
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Noda, you're in luck. 
You've got one more can.

217
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,410
Lucky me.

218
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,710
Ah, give it to me, too !

219
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,550
No, this happiness is mine only.

220
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,560
This is the only good thing that happened today.

221
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Just give it to me !

222
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,850
Really, it's a terrible waste.

223
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,650
Yeah.

224
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,300
It's more than terrible.

225
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

226
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,650
Anyway, at age 15...

227
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:54,410
...we went from junior high to high school after the brief spring break.

228
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,120


229
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Kick harder !

230
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,550
Your arm is bent !

231
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,000
Hang in there !

232
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,450
Practice starts tomorrow.

233
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,220
Okay.

234
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,530
What's your specialty ?

235
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,340
Butterfly.

236
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,000
What ? Butterfly ?

237
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah.

238
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Have you previously done it ?

239
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,780
Um, not at all.

240
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,440
Fight, oh, fight, oh, fight, oh, fight, oh... 

241
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,700
Kine Ryutarou has a large lead !
It's a splendid run !

242
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,200
Huh ?

243
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,300
Yeah, go, go, go, go !
Go, go, go, go, go !

244
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,940
What a noisy guy.

245
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,070
All right, passed one guy !

246
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,000
Two guys !

247
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,600
Now, a shot !

248
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,800
Goal !

249
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,500
Goal !

250
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,390
Kine, you're cool !

251
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,010
Wow !
Kine, you're cool !

252
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,010
Kine, you're cool !

253
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:56,950


254
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,990
Look this way !

255
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,720
Honestly, high school
soccer is the best now.

256
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,120
High school baseball is passé, after all.

257
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,950
Whatever.

258
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,490


259
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,120
I saw it !

260
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,980
I saw it, too !

261
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,100
Kine ! This way ! This way !

262
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,410
Hm ?

263
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,350
Wow ?!

264
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,300
Ouch...

265
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,330
Oh my ! I'm sorry.

266
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,190
Are you okay ?
You're not injured are you ?
You're not injured ?

267
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,190
Are you okay ?
You're not injured are you ?

268
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,810
I accidentally dropped them. 
I'm really sorry.

269
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,580
Are you okay ?

270
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,610
Ah !

271
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,690
But I've only just bought them
and haven't even worn them yet.

273
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,010
So they're clean.

274
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,910
How sad...

275
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,850
What ?

276
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,910
Never mind.

277
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,430
I'm not injured. You don't have to worry about me.

278
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,760
Hm ?

279
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,520
Oh !

280
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,750
Oh ?

281
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,300
Were you able to burn
your "springtime of life" ?

282
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,450
Um, well...

283
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,080
Are you okay ?

284
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,360
Ah !
Are you okay ?

285
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,650
Are you okay ?

286
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,450
This is tough...

287
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,060
Are you okay ?

288
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,200
Sorry about that.

289
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Is he a pupil of Hayashiya or something ?

290
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,050
You didn't get injured, did you ?

291
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,610
Oh, I'll get someone to retrieve the
ball later, so you can just leave it there.

292
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,500
Bye.

293
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,850
Fight, oh, fight, oh, fight, oh.

294
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,040
Let's go !

295
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,860
I may have found it.

296
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,900
What ? What did you find ?

297
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,360
Something that makes me passionate.

298
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,400
Are you going to burn it ?

299
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,450
Maybe.

300
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:57,270
Yeah, at age 15, we started to turn the pages of the springtime of life drama...

301
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,040
...prepared on the stage for each of us.

302
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,160
So, in the end, what are you going to do, Hiro ?

303
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,960
In the end, I'm going to play soccer.

304
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,990
Girls love it, after all.

305
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,060
That's what it is.

306
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,720
But are you sure you can forget ?

307
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,600
Hm ?

308
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,640
Baseball.

309
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,010
Baseball dumped me, you know ?

310
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,500
Next episode of H2,
"Aim for Ryogoku Kokugikan."

311
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,970
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
