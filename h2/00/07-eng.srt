1
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,850


2
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Are you burning the porn 
you've looked at too many times ?

3
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,810
Oh yes, son, did you already say hello to the daughter of the company president ?

4
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,680
Yeah.

5
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,020
You didn't do anything rude, did you ?

6
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,070
No.

7
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,900
Don't get infatuated with her, okay ?

8
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,830
Huh ?


9
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,950
Well, you can. But if you do, you'll have to marry her.

10
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,010
Well, jokes aside, do the best you can to put in a good word for me.

11
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,880
My promotion depends on you, sort of.

12
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm counting on you.

13
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,660
Before that, you should try not to hang yourself first.

14
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, the necktie...

15
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,460
Honey, the tie...

16
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,000
With this weather, it won't burn.

17
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,660
Shoot !

18
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,340
Dammit...


19
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,400
All right, let's wrap it up now.

20
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,500
Don't make morning practice an excuse for being late to class.

21
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,390
Okay !

22
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,430
Hey.

23
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,130
Hey.

24
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,940
We had a great workout yesterday.

25
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,150
I totally agree.

26
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,630
So how does your elbow feel ?



27
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,250
Looks like it's still attached.

28
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,260
How about you ?

29
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,540
The same.

30
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,490
Kunimi !

31
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,410
Wait up, Kunimi !

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
For some reason, there's a desk in the middle of the hallway.

33
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,750
Good morning. Thanks 
for your work yesterday.

34
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,600
Are you okay ?

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm sorry. When I was in junior high, I only watched high school baseball.


36
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,300
I didn't know that you
were a famous ballplayer.

37
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,260
You scraped your knee.

38
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,910
Oh, I'm fine.
I have a band-aid.

39
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,050
Unless she scrapes a spot a little higher up, there won't be any service for the viewers.

40
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,800
What ?

41
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,440
Nothing.

42
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,980
Look. I stayed up late last night to make this.

43
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,200
I asked the guys in my class...

44
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,900
...but most of them didn't even know that the Baseball Fan Club existed.

45
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,800
I thought so.

46
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,640
If we advertise more, there should be 
more boys who want to play baseball...

47
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,300
...regardless of how well they play.

48
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,070
Maybe.

49
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,200
Anyway, we have to
recruit new members...

50
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,790
...and ask the principal to make this an official club as soon as possible.


51
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,400
After all, we have an amazing battery, Kunimi and Noda.


52
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,550
We should definitely aim for the Koushien.

53
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,050
About that, Noda and I only meant to be temporary club members, just for yesterday.

54
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,070
Sorry.

55
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,570
What ? Why ?


56
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,650
Well, you'll find out sooner or later, so I should just tell you.

57
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,960
Neither Noda nor I can
play baseball anymore.

58
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,800
My problem is my elbow.
Noda's is his back.

59
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,650
We were both stopped from
playing baseball by a physician.

60
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,730
I had heard a rumor to that effect, but I guess it's true.

61
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,300
Yeah, even after throwing as
few pitches as I did yesterday...

62
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,500
Does it hurt ?

63
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,900
Not really.

64
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,150
But anyway, it's an elbow made of glass, which will break down within three months.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,210
I see.

66
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,200
I'm sorry that I got your
hopes up for no reason.

67
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm sorry, too.

68
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,300
I didn't know about
your circumstances...

69
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,800
...and I tried to drag you back into baseball even though you were trying to forget about it.

70
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,700
You wouldn't want to be seen here, so you should go on ahead.

71
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,280
What ?

72
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,880
This is men's bathroom.

73
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,450
Oh !

74
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,250
Oh, yes.

75
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,120
Until I graduate from high school, please don't fire my father.

76
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,250
Your pitching yesterday was cooler than any of the other pitchers I've ever seen.

77
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,370
Honestly.


78
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,850
Um, that's not what
I was talking about.

79
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,860
See you later.

80
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,700
Hey, the stairs are behind you !

81
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh !

82
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,820
Are you okay ?

83
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,990
I have a band-aid !

84
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Hey, Kine, who competed with Hideo for
the cleanup spot on the Hakusan Angels...

85
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,150
...lost the battle, and got ousted.

86
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,700
Shut up. Cut out the
unnecessary narration.

87
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,010
You seem rather friendly with my Haruka.

88
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,660
You were eavesdropping
while taking a seat there ?

89
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,130
I could hear it even if I didn't want to.

90
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,130
Well, there's no use going after Haruka. I'm going to get Haruka's love.


91
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,350
I don't miss a shot I take.

92
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,300
Besides, do you actually think Haruka would have any interest in a pathetic guy like you ?



93
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,500
You hurt your elbow
and quit baseball, right ?

94
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,600
And yet, you got heated up over a bush-league baseball game.

95
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
How disgraceful.

96
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,690
You're not manly, being so irresolute for all this time.

97
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,950
Oh, pathetic.
I wouldn't want to be like that.

98
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,380
Besides, baseball is just...

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,000
Hey.

100
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,300
What is it ?

101
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,860
You should wash your hands.

102
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,000
Here.

103
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,250
Hey, that was a splendid swing, as usual.

104
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,350
I'm sorry, Koga.

105
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,600
The pitcher with a bum elbow and the catcher with a bad back are...

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,990
What do you want ?

107
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,530
It seems that you're looking for 
new members. Did anyone come ?



108
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,880
It's none of your business.

109
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:49,170
Well, either way, there's no use doing practice swings and playing catch aimlessly.

110
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,450
It's useless without sound
theory and proper instruction.


111
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,810
I don't want to say this, but...

112
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,480
I don't want to hear it, either.

113
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,650
Before I started playing soccer...

114
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,830
...I was the ace pitcher hitting cleanup on the famous little league Hakusan Angels squad.

115
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't mean to brag, but I'm very knowledgeable about baseball.

116
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,600
You're such a nuisance.
What are you trying to say ?

117
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,650
What I'm saying is this.

118
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,450
Depending on how you treat me...

119
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,790
...I don't mind coming here part-time as a special member to coach your players.

120
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,200
I can participate in your bush-league games and teach your guys what a victory feels like.

121
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,300
How about it ?

122
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,170
Oh.

123
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,310
My response is this.

124
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,260


125
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,300
We are the Baseball Fan Club.

126
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,200
We're certainly looking for new members,
but we only want people who love baseball.


127
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,350
Do you understand ? Goodbye.

128
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,020
Oh, you don't have to give me a response right now.

129
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,590
Now, let's practice.

130
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,850
A pitcher with a bum elbow and the catcher with a bad back ?

131
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,080
I feel like I heard that somewhere.


132
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,320
It's not broken yet.

133
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,010
If I keep pitching, it'll break down in three months.

134
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,370
Well, whatever the case...

135
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,450
Now, I should go to a club activity.

136
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,910
Which one shall we go to today ?

137
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,840
Hey.

138
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,990
Oh, the guy who competed with Hideo on the Hakusan Angels...

139
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,290
Enough of that.


140
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,330
Okay.

141
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,240
Are you going home ?

142
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm envious.

143
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,230
We have to practice all the time and don't even have time to go on dates.


144
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,570
You mean you don't have anyone to go on a date with, right ?

145
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm not the same as you.

146
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,710
Really, what's with that cardboard box ?

147
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,500
It's "my cardboard box."

148
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,490
Huh ?

149
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,500
Well, see you.

150
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,150
Humph.

151
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,920
The school gate is in
the opposite direction.

152
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,770
 Eyecatch

153
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,900
Well, let's see.

154
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,550
What will it be next ?

155
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,830
Mister, what you're looking for is this.

156
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,500
Wow...!

157
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,250
Kunimi Hiro isn't the kind 
of guy who will be satisfied...

158
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,510
...with a two-dimensional 
world forever, Hikari.

159
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,360
What is it ?

160
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,930
Hiro.

161
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,830
Your coffee is ready.

162
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,010
Hey, this is not a café.

163
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,840
Regular customers deserve good service.

164
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,200
What is that ?

165
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,370
You mostly just read in the store and
then buy a few cheap porn magazines.

166
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,360
Once in a while, you should buy a literary book with a hardcover.

167
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,550
What am I going to do with this ?

168
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,800
You read it.


169
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,750
It looks bad for the eyes.

170
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,370
It should be good for your brain.

171
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,200
So, how many innings
did you pitch yesterday ?

172
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,400
Sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth.

173
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
Four innings.

174
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,660
How is your elbow ?

175
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,530
Surprisingly, there's no pain.

176
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,900
Oh well.

177
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,540
Why bother going to a school with no baseball club if you're just going to do it anyway ?

178
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,540
...if this is what you end up doing ?

179
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,360
It just got to me.
Well, I guess it was just youthful folly.

180
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,100
Maybe you wanted to show that cute 
manager how great you were or something.

181
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,820
It's not like that.

182
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,300
The soccer club guys disrespected baseball, so I got a little mad.


183
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,200
That's why I said that if you love baseball so much...

184
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,610
...you should continue playing until you break down.

185
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,820
Hikari knows your character well.

186
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,990
She said it because she was 
honestly worried about your body.

187
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I wonder.

188
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,020
Did you say something ?

189
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,200
Shut up.

190
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,920
I've spent such a long time with it that it 
takes me a while to forget about it altogether.

191
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,460
In terms of the time spent together, you've spent more time with me than with baseball.

192
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,100


193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,650
That's why I said that if you love baseball so much...

194
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,190
...you should continue playing until you break down.

195
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,280
Goal !


196
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,740
The Nationals are calling to me !

197
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,110
Wow, wow. He's so cheery this early in the morning.

198
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,660
Hey, Kunimi.

199
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,000
What was that cardboard box from yesterday about ?

200
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:07,900
Kunimi.

201
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,150
He's calling you.

202
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,200
Ignore him.

203
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,290
Kunimi, wait up.

204
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,700
More importantly, which club 
activity are we going to today ?

205
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,600
Since they have so many A-ranked candidates...

206
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,680
...how about we go to both the
 volleyball club and the tennis club ?

207
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,530
That sounds great.

208
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,690
I'm looking forward to after school.

209
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,870
Kunimi !

210
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,230
Yes, honestly.

211
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,780
Hey, listen to me ! Kunimi !

212
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,350
Oh, it's over.

213
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,820
The class is over.

214
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,190
Hurry up !

215
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,950
You can go ahead and go home.

216
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,450
The day duty people !

217
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,530
Bye !

218
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,370
Hey, Kunimi.

219
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,510
Did you wash your hands ?

220
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,500
Hey...

221
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,330
Oh, yeah.
 Kunimi, I'm in a jam.

222
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,100
Huh ?

223
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,620
You want to hear it ?

224
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,020
No, not really.

225
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,650
Oh, you want to hear it.

226
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,770
To tell the truth, Haruka asked me to be the coach of the Fan Club.

227
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,700
Oh.

228
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,200
As you know, I'm the ace striker on the 
soccer club, even though I'm just a first year.

229
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,650
So I have the important responsibility of taking the club to the Nationals.


230
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,900
But I can't heartlessly turn down the
 earnest request by my beloved Haruka.

231
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,230
Honestly, I'm troubled, Kunimi.

232
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,750
Hey ! You should listen
to what people say !

233
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,080
What are you doing after school, the Going Home Club ?

234
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,530
But really, what is
that cardboard box for ?

235
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,550
Goal !

236
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,110
How ominous...

237
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,600
Not.

238
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm going to get new shoes.

239
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,810
Don't waste time ! 
Come back in five minutes !

240
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,550
Yes, sir !

241
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,300
Well, let's take a break.

242
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,750
This genius, Kine Ryutarou, doesn't need to practice.

243
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,900
Now, let's practice !

244
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,270
Let's go !

245
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,890
Hm ?

246
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,260
Wow !

247
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,310
How was it, Hiro ?

248
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,610
Well...

249
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,020
Who were the A's ?

250
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,000
The pony-tailed girl and the girl with the blue polka dot panties, maybe.

251
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,740
Aren't you being too generous ?

252
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,200
Then you might make it a B+.

253
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,010
B+...

254
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,880
Hey !

255
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:08,700
Hi.

256
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,210
Hey.

257
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,540
This is what you've been doing ?

258
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,700
Come to think of it...

259
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,000
...the tennis club meeting will be over soon and the girls will be coming to change clothes.

260
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,290
Yeah, the tennis club has many A-rank candidates.

261
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,380
Hey !

262
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,580
Talk to me later. 
We're busy right now.

263
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,930
Damn you...!

264
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,680
If you don't lend me that box, I'll tell the teachers !


265
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,480
Listen. Stay still.

266
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,450
Got it.

267
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,830
If you stay still, they won't notice.

268
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,950
Got it.

269
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,190
Don't make any sound.

270
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,310
Got it.

271
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,700
I got it, so just go away.

272
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,930
Oh well, I would have
liked to see it, too.

273
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,510
Right ?

274
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,170
Let's go have some anmitsu together later.

275
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,990
That sounds great.

276
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,650
Oh, really ?

277
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,650
Great !

278
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,300
Let's go.

279
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,170
Here they come...!

280
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,920
Here it is...!

281
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,640
Maybe we'll do...?

282
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,410
Now, hurry up and change.

283
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,030
What ?

284
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,900
What ? What ? What ? What ?

285
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,000
What ? What ? What ?

286
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,740
What...?!

287
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,170
But really, he's so
easy to understand.

288
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,900
Yeah.

289
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,960
This should quiet him down a little.

290
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,200
I wonder.

291
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,590
Rain...

292
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,840
Passing rain-shower...

293
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,790
Yeah.

294
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,450
Hiro, what are we going to do 
about the club activity tomorrow ?

295
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,050
Just ask the rain.

296
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,330
Ugh...!

297
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,620
Next Episode

298
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,940
Hiro, big news !

299
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,720
What's the ruckus ? I'm calmly trying to figure out my next goal right now.

300
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,450
It's more important than that !

301
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,340
The way you make it sound,
something is about to happen.

302
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,150
You know Uetake Clinic, right ?

303
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,260
It's the physician who diagnosed my elbow.

304
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,440
That physician is... 
Oh, I can't say anymore.

305
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
Oh, that's not nice !

306
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,990
Next episode of H2 is
"The Elbow is Made of Glass, He Says."

307
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,410
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

308
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,620
