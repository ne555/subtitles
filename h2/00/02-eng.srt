00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,300
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,420
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:47,150
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,160
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,100
The game starts now.

7
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,170
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

8
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,240
It makes my heart bound.

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,740
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

10
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

 Episode 02

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,200
Hey, newcomer !

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,180
Yes ?

14
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,620
What's your name ?

15
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm Kunimi Hiro.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,300
Kunimi, huh ?
You're not very cute.

17
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,380
Huh ?

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,100
Normally, when newcomers are 
made to run this much, they collapse.

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,820
I see.

20
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,250
Then we upperclassmen 
would proudly preach to them...

21
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,250
...and that makes it easier
for us to coach you later.

22
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,700
That's the objective of
this running exercise.

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,250
Oh.

24
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,870
You really aren't cute.

25
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,400
Look.

26
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,560
See how cute the other newcomers are.

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,550
If I do another 50 laps,
I'm confident that I'll collapse.

28
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,300
Don't bother ! You're in the way,
so just sit there or something.

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Hey, first years !

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,620
You're pathetic ! 
Pull yourselves together !

31
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,400
Oh, there it goes !

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,300
Fore !

33
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,160
Moron, that's golf.

34
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,650
What's this ball ?

35
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,300
I'll take care of it right away.

37
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,690
Please give it to us.

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm really sorry.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,760
Don't come in here with 
your dirty spiked shoes !

40
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,650
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

41
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,810
Sorry for the intrusion.

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,550
What is it ?

43
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,740
I thought there wasn't a 
baseball club at this school.

44
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,090
It's not a club.

45
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,300
It's a fan club.

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,060
They can only play catch and stuff.
They just play around in the backyard.

47
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,410
Fan club...

48
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,250
Soccer Club

49
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,120
Come in.

50
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,720
Um, I came here to bring the photo that I forgot to put on the club registration.

51
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,640
Oh, Kunimi.
I've heard about you.

52
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm Kawamura Hikari, a second year
and the manager of the soccer club.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
You can call me Hikari.

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,550
That's what everyone calls me.

55
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,850
Kawamura Hikari...

56
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,650
I heard about it.

57
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,330
During the welcome rite for newcomers, the hellish running exercise...

58
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,330
...you didn't even break a sweat.

59
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,090
But don't get cocky. Those newcomers are just general admission members.

60
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,900
General admission ?

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,300
That's right. That excludes
those with previous experience.

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,370
I see.

63
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,860
Here it is, Kawamura.

64
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,170
You can call me Hikari.

65
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,800
Sure...

66
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,660
...Kawamura.

67
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,700
You can call me Hikari, I'm telling you.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,990
Hikari.

69
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,340
Huh ?

70
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,940
Is Hideo out somewhere ?

71
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,400
I've been telling you. 
Our baseball club is well-known.

72
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,550
He can't be lying around during the day, unlike somebody.

73
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,810
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

74
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,480
Koushien...
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,700
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

76
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,300
For high school baseball players,
that goes without saying.

77
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,380
Well, I wish Hide-chan well.

78
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,000
I've found a new goal for myself.

79
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,990
Aim

80
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,590
Hey, where does the national 
tournament for soccer take place ?

81
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,620
Ryogoku Kokugikan.

82
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,160
Oh, I see.

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,590
Aim

84
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,550
Ryogoku

85
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,000
Koku

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,450

87
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,900

Ryogokku Kokugikan
Hiro

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,900
Does it seem weird ?

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,700
Not as much as your head.

91
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,000
Hey.

92
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,750
Hi, Noda.
How's your back ?

93
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,640
It's doing well these days.

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,800
Maybe my rehab is doing some good.

95
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,620
What are you doing for rehab ?

96
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,700
Butterfly style.
Swimming, I mean.

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,780
Butterfly ?

98
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,160
Is it okay for you
to be doing that ?

99
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,180
The doctor says so, 
so it should be fine.

100
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,930
Hikari, do you know where the
half-eaten bread that was here went ?

101
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,880
It was getting moldy, so I threw it away.

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,390
Oh, really ?
It was only three days old.

103
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,880
That's right.
It's getting warmer these days.

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,300
Oh well.

105
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,940
Hey, friend in idleness.

106
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,380
What is it ?

107
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,720
Let's idle around.

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,110
Don't idle around me.

109
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,900
Stop it.

110
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,220
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo
Stop it.

111
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,150
Idling. Idling.
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

112
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm telling you to stop it.
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

113
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,400
Meiwa Daiichi High School

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,700
How is it going, Tachibana ?

115
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,150
That's our ace pitcher, Maruyama.

116
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,640
His pitches are fast, aren't they ?

117
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,190
He's ranked among the best in terms of
right-handed power pitchers in the prefecture.

118
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,900
A power pitcher, huh ?

119
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,730
Alright !

120
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,080
It went right down the middle !

121
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,850
It doesn't matter where
that pitch was located.

122
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,680
People can barely get to it.

123
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,300
Seriously ?

124
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,470
Then next, I'm going to 
throw my specialty, the forkball.

126
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,360
Hey, hey ! Don't !

127
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,900
Wha...?

128
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,350
How is that a forkball ?

129
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,660
That was just a 140km pitch that bounced !

130
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,620
It dropped a little.

131
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,580
Right, Hide ?

132
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,540
I don't know.

133
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,850
A 140km forkball...

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,130
What ? Did you say something ?

135
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,530
Um, it's nothing.


136
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,800
See ? Kids nowadays
prefer soccer to baseball.

137
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,650
Yeah, I guess.

138
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,030
It's only for old people who watch the 
night games and sip of beer these days.

139
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,920
Yeah, I guess.

140
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,650
You don't sound very
committed when you agree.

141
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,010
Really ?

142
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,130
Anyway, soccer is great.

143
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,510
Swimming is good, too.

144
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,190
I'm going running.

145
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,940
I'm going to run, too.

146
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm going.

147
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,700
Oh, Hiro, hold on a second.

148
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,160
What ?

149
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,700
I've been meaning to tell you...

150
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,210
...that the daughter my company's 
president is enrolled at your high school.

151
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,910
Make sure that you're courteous to her.

152
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,180
Who cares ?

153
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,650
No way I'm bringing parents' 
hierarchical relationship into school.

154
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,960
Don't be such a square.

155
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,220
Do it for the sake of my promotion.

156
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,250
Geez. You can't get promoted unless
you suck up to the president's daughter ?

157
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,800
Of course I can. Don't you 
know how well I do my work ?

158
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,890
What's her name ?

159
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's see.
If I recall, her name is Koga...

160
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,550
Oh, yeah.
It's Koga Haruka.

161
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,850
I'm going.

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,600
Dammit, I'm running late. Kawamura's small talk goes on way too long.

163
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,670
Um, I'm sorry. 
Are you okay ?

164
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,200
Um, I haven't heard 
your name yet, have I ?

165
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,550
Kunimi Hiro.

166
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,170
I'm Koga Haruka.

167
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,820
What are all these balls for ?

168
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,460
I just tripped a little.

169
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,740
Oh, didn't you know ? Our school doesn't have a baseball club, but it has a baseball fan club.

170
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,720
Oh, I see.

171
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,640
I love high school baseball, so I'm going to be the manager of the club starting today.

172
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,510
Oh, good luck.

173
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,580
I've got to go to my practice, too.

174
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,090
Is it the soccer club ?

175
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,450
Yeah.

176
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,060
Soccer is certainly popular.

177
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,530
That's right.

178
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,310
I like baseball better, though.

179
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,480
Well, that's fine.

180
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,540
Hey.

181
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,170
Yes ?

182
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,600
There's one more.

183
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,230
Thanks.

184
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,000
This is the smell I remember from my younger days.

185
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,600
Huh ?

186
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,000
There.

187
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,190
Thanks.

188
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,100
There, there, there, there, there !

189
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,500
Here I come !

190
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,980
Shoot it !

191
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,990
Goal !

192
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,000
Honestly, he's noisy.


193
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,000
He's not just a noisy guy.

194
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,150
Kine Ryutarou.

195
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,650
He was the ace striker
for Kitano Junior High...

196
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,480
...the second place team in
the Prefectural Tournament.

197
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,050
Really ?

198
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,300
He's an exceptional talent, even among
the special admission first year members.

199
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,820
There's no doubt that he'll 
immediately be a regular, huh ?

200
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,630
I'm envious.

201
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,200
Hey, general admission members !

202
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,690
Stop chit-chatting and get back
to plucking weeds already !

203
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,100
Okay.

204
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,550
Hey, running-lover Kunimi.

205
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,120
Hm ?

206
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,840
Go get some coffee.

207
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,950
Oh, then for me, too.

208
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah, I want oolong tea.

209
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,000
I want grape juice.

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,760
I want hot oolong tea.

211
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,830
Hey, you.

212
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,600
Get mine, too.

213
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,430
He certainly isn't just a noisy guy.

214
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,200
After a brief spring break, I suddenly go from the highest grade in school to a newcomer.

215
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,530
It's all sold out ?

216
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,500
Two cans of orange juice.

217
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
A can of Coke.

218
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,960
And three cans of coffee.

219
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,830
It's heavy.

220
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,800
Aim for Ryogoku Kokugikan
Hiro

221
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,060
Dammit.
It's a long path to get there.

222
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,350
What kind of swing is that ?

223
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,290
It's so slow a fly 
could land on the bat !

224
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,210
Be quiet. You don't belong here, so don't butt in.

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can't watch this.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,310
Hey, Koga. Dont waste your time on such a helpless fan club.

227
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,300
Why don't you become the 
manager for the soccer club ?

228
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,000
You can aim for the Nationals with me.

229
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,120
Nationals ?

230
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,700
Ryogoku Kokugikan
Hiro
Aim for

231
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,600
National
Ryogoku Kokugikan
Hiro
Aim for

232
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,960
National Ryogoku Kokugikan...?

233
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,870
Leave me alone. 
I like the Koushien better.

234
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,540
How can a fan club without even a practice field get to the Koushien ?

235
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
We'll try hard and 
make it an actual club.

236
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,300
You don't know anything, do you ?

237
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,720
No matter how hard you try,
it's hopeless at this school.

238
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,180
Right, Seniors ?

239
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,800
Um, what is he talking about ?

240
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,490
Well, we aren't really
 focused on the Koushien...

241
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,000
We just love baseball.

242
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,480
We can play two bush-league games a month at the municipal park, after all.

243
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,950
Of course. No real baseball club will play with you guys.

244
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,700
Shut up !

245
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,090
Just go away already ! 
You're getting in the way of our practice !

246
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,550
Well, I hope you'll wake up soon and come to the soccer club.

247
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,050
Canned coffee. Canned coffee.

248
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,470
She's cute, isnt she ?

249
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,050
She's in my class. 
Her name is Koga Haruka.

250
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,890
As far as I can tell, she's the best among the first years.

251
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,060
Just watch. I'm going to score
a goal with her by summer.

252
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,000
Before that...

253
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,100
...shouldn't you thank a guy 
who made a long uphill run...

254
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,110
...with twenty cans of coffee and oolong tea and stuff ?

255
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,750
Um, thanks.

256
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,950
Take half of this.

257
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,250
Sure.

258
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,900
Um, you don't know who I am ?

259
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,550
I'm Kine from Kitano Junior High.

260
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,970
I'm fairly famous
in the soccer world !

261
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,540
I didn't see anything about you in the rulebook I read.

262
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,530
Hey...

263
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,940
You're late, Kunimi !

264
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,160
Shoot it !

265
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,100
Damn him !

266
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,580
Hey, Kunimi !

267
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,920
Yes ?

268
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,790
Go get the ball !

269
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,330
Sure.

270
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,290
I'm giving it back to you.

271
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Hey...

272
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,730
Damn him...

273
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,500
Hey, newcomer !

274
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,540
Yes ?

275
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,200
It's a decade too early
for you to kick the ball !

276
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,370
I don't want to be in 
high school for a decade...

277
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,510
Run !

278
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,860
Just watch. I'm aiming for...

279
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,430
...Ryogoku Kokugikan.

280
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,990
Was it National Ryogoku Kokugikan...?

281
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,500
Is sumo fun for you ?

282
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,300
Hey.

283
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,500
Are you having fun with sumo ?

284
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,100
But it was unexpected.

285
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,780
Even though it is popular with girls,
I never thought you'd choose sumo.

286
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,500
Huh ? What are you talking about ?

287
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,800
I mean, you joined
the sumo club, right ?

288
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,170
Who did ?

289
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,250
Aim for Ryogoku Kokugikan
Hiro

290
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,350
Damn that Hikari !

291
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,060
Moron. It's your fault
for not realizing it.

292
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,990
Since you were a child, all you
cared about was baseball, after all.

293
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,970
Hey, stop the videotape !
Don't watch ahead !

294
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,300
Is your baseball club really okay ?

295
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,650
To think that your baseball club
has lots of these videotapes...

296
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,270
Don't worry. There's no correlation
 between baseball skills and lewdness.

297
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,200
Right, Hiro ?

298
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,800
Shut up.

299
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,740
All right, it's done.

300
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,650
Aim for Nihon Budoukan
Hiro
This is good, right, Hide ?

301
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,000
Are you having fun 
with rock & roll music ?

302
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,070
I'm impressed, 
Hideo the grown-up !

303
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,950
Did you trick me ?

304
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,000
I never thought anyone would be 
stupid enough to be fooled like this !

305
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,960
Damn you !

306
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey !

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,800
<i>Oh, silly.</i>

308
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,430
It might seem to go without saying, but I will explain to you good kids.

309
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,000
Ryogoku Kokugikan is where sumo matches take place.

310
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,010
Nihon Budoukan is known to be a concert hall where rock bands aspire to perform.

311
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,200
By the way, the national tournament 
for high school soccer takes place at...

312
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,900
Hey, who the heck are you talking to ?!

313
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,920
<i>No ! Don't do it, silly.</i>

314
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,000
This guy is a moron !

315
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,720
It's not me !

316
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,930
Stop it ! Cut it out already !

317
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,730
<i>Don't stop it ! More, silly !</i>

318
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,830

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Happiness is not something...

341
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,330
...that someone does for me.

342
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:30,900
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

343
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,920
Hey, Hiro, is soccer fun ?

344
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,620
It's fun. There's someone that makes me passionate, too.

345
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,020
In truth, you might still have an attachment to baseball.

346
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,550
There's no baseball club at our school.

347
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,370
But there's a fan club, right ?

348
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,610
Sounds like it.

349
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,900
They're going to play a practice
 game against the soccer club, I hear.

350
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,300
It doesn't concern me, probably.

351
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,200
