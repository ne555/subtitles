00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,700


12
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,730
Hey, Hey, Soccer Club...


13
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,400
Hey, Hey, Soccer Club...

14
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,210
Your bra is showing through.

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,380
You're exuding such sex appeal.

16
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,630
Hey !

17
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,990
Bye.

18
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,210
Hiro, wait.

19
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,490
Who's he ?

20
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,700
The guy who's taking the
fielding practice right now.

21
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
He's Tachibana Hideo, who came
from Hirai Elementary School.

22
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,010
He hit cleanup for the Hakusan Angels.

23
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,480
He's big, isn't he ? It's depressing 
that he's in the same grade as me.

24
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,400
It's just that you're too tiny.

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,150
Really, what's with that baggy uniform ?

26
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,760
How sloppy.

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,390
My father says that since I have big hands
and feet, I'll definitely grow in junior high.

28
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,140
That the uniform will fit me well by
the end of the first year, he says.

29
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,040
Oh.

30
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,970
One more !

31
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,880
Tachibana Hideo...

32
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,860
Oh !

33
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,310
You have such sex appeal !

34
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,810
Geez ! Hiro, you're
such a pervy midget !

35
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,050
I'm going to get bigger !

36
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,710
Your mind must have been 
wandering off somewhere, Amamiya.

37
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,000
Listen, everyone.
Heart, mind, body.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,800
As a result of the fulfillment of 
each of those, arrows are shot.

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,920
Your hands don't release the arrows.
Arrows release themselves.

40
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,200
The desire to shoot the target.
The anxiety over missing the target.

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,550
Or the fear, or wavering.

42
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,270
If you have those, your mind
will not reach fulfillment.

43
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,970
Love works the same, too.

44
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,570
The arrow is your feeling.
The target is the other person's heart.

45
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,000
First, the arrow, your
feeling must be honest.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,130
Then the target, you shouldn't
be fooled by its appearance.

47
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,000
You should thoroughly 
discern it with your mind's eye.

48
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,290
Now, try it.

49
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,650
You shouldn't be impatient. 
Wait for the fulfillment of the mind.

50
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,550
Wait for the arrow to release itself.

51
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,550
Listen. It's too late for
 regrets after you release it.

52
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,490
Once released, the
arrow will never return.

53
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,040
Love works the same...

54
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Hey.

55
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,360
Shoot !

56
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,880
Goal !

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,300
Okay, Kunimi.
Switch with Saitou.

58
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,200
That guy is mean.

59
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,300
During practice with a novice, 
he doesn't have to go that far.

60
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,200
Yeah.

61
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,140
Since we're members of the soccer club, 
we can't call ourselves novices anymore.

62
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,430
Huh ?

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,650
It starts from here for us.

64
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,840
Yay !

65
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,420
I don't care what it is, as long as it makes me passionate.

66
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,250
Hey, Kunimi, bring me a Coke.

67
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,990
I want my usual oolong tea.

68
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,680
Don't forget my strawberry milk shake.

69
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
I'll go, too !

70
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
Kine, you don't need to !

71
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,480
It's time for me to
go to the bathroom !

72
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,420
Hey.

73
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,810
The bathroom is that way.

74
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,910
You know what I want. 
Don't be such a square.

75
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,790
See ya.

76
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,100
My wrath will eventually reach its height.

77
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,550
Eventually, of course.

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,740
What ?

79
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,970
The opponent for our game 
tomorrow has a schedule conflict ?

80
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,790
Yes, a greengrocer named
Kuma said so just now.

81
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:51,200
Oh, crud. I was looking
forward to tomorrow's game.

82
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,290
What are we going to do ?

83
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,180
Even if it's bush league, we won't be
able to find another team this late.

84
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,400
It can't be helped.

85
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,640
We'll just practice by
ourselves tomorrow.

86
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,900
How wasteful, on the day we
get to use the municipal park.

87
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,440
Oh, well. I wanted to show
you how cool we were.

88
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,030
What a bummer.

89
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,250
But being able to use the whole field to 
do our fielding practice should feel good.

90
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,900
That's how baseball
should be, of course.
That in itself feels good.

91
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,480
That's how baseball
should be, of course.

92
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,440
That's right.

93
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,170
How silly that they talk like 
they know what they're doing...

94
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,400
A baseball game ?

95
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,850
Against those fan club guys ?

96
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,940
I hear that they're troubled because they
don't have an opponent for tomorrow's game.

98
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,760
Who cares ? Why should 
we have to play with them ?

99
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,040
Hold on.

100
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,370
This sounds interesting.

101
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,340
Even if it's just a fan club, they probably have some pride in themselves.

102
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,100
But what if they lose to 
a soccer club in baseball ?

103
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,000
They'll become the 
laughingstock of the whole school.

104
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,900
There's no guarantee that we'll win.

105
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,560
That's not a problem.

106
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,150
No matter which sport it is...

107
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,700
...what makes the difference in the end are innate athleticism and physical strength.

108
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,710
Back in the day, those talents went into baseball, but now it's different.

109
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:22,200
And at our school, the club that accumulates most of those talents is this soccer club.

110
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,500
You're right.

111
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,550
We should have at least eight people here who've played some baseball.

112
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,980
Eight ?

113
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,240
Excluding me, I mean.

114
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,490
You seem confident.

115
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,010
No matter which sport, it comes down to athleticism and physical strength.

116
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,110
All right, leave it to me.

117
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:49,010
To tell the truth, I once had to think of
whether to choose soccer or baseball.

118
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,650
Let's crush those annoying cockroaches.

119
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,450
I'm safe.

121
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,800
I was happy, so I was in a rush.

122
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,530
Are you going to play in 
the game tomorrow, too ?

123
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,180
Game ?

124
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,130
I haven't heard about it.

125
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,500
Of course, I'm just a novice.

126
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,220
I hope you'll be able to play.

127
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,210
Baseball is fun.

128
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,220
I know, but...

129
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,490
Baseball ?

130
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,460
I need to go and let everyone know.

131
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,550
What's she talking about ?

132
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,710
I've been waiting for this.

133
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,670
What ? A game
against the fan club ?

134
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,810
Kunimi !

135
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,240
Yes.

136
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,750
You ran ?

137
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,570
Yes.

138
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,570
Run until the sun sets !

139
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,780
Yes, Kunimi Hiro will run toward tomorrow.

140
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,770
Stop with the cool act !

141
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,900
Ten more pitches !

142
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,910
What a hitter...

143
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,550
Hide-chan is big.

144
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,260
What is it ?

145
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,650
I thought it had stayed the same.

146
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,610
What did ?

147
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,690
The height difference between us.

148
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,150
It's been the same since junior high.

149
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,510
Yeah.

150
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,450
If it suddenly changes, 
will we be surprised ?

151
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,070
But he began growing all of a sudden.

152
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,070
What ?

153
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm talking about Hiro.

154
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,050
He grew noticeably in the first year.

155
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,450
Yeah.

156
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,690
Not only his height, 
but also his baseball skills.

157
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,300
Right.

158
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,330
As a human being, he still needs to do some growing up, though.

159
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,150
You have the right to say that ?

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,240
About Hiro, yeah.

161
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,500
Maybe I have the right to say that, too.

162
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,400
What is it ?

163
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,700
You said something just now, didn't you ?

164
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,300
Well, if it were a speaking cat...

165
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
...I would've sent it in for a funny home video show or something.

166
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,030
EYECATCH

167
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,420
Can I throw a little more seriously ?

168
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,330
What ?

169
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,910
Ugh !

170
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,350
Captain, it's too fast for me to catch !

171
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,880
Don't be a wimp. It's because you
get scared and move the mitt.

172
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,580
Switch with me and
 play catcher, please.

173
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,810
Moron ! I said I'm playing third and hitting fourth !

174
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,360
But...

175
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,930
It's okay. I'll go easy.

176
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,200
That should be enough of a handicap.

177
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,140
Hey, what is that supposed to mean ?

178
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,100
Are you going to use that 
as an excuse when you lose ?

179
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,590
I'm just being considerate.

180
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,200
You probably want to 
score a run at least, right ?

181
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,300
Just because your
pitches are a little fast...

182
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,400
...you'll get burned if you underestimate baseball.

183
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,980
It can't be helped. He says he 
can't catch it if I pitch full-strength.

184
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,500
Captain...

185
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,660
Geez, it can't be helped.

186
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,150
Is it okay to come in here 
without permission on a Sunday ?

187
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,430
It's okay.
I do have permission.

188
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,660
I can't focus these days.

189
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,900
You might get more
distracted if I'm watching.

190
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,260
No, I asked you to be here
because I wanted you to watch.

191
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,160
Was that a problem ?

192
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,870
No, I just asked because 
I was afraid I might be an annoyance.

193
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,150
Hey, can't anyone else play catcher ?

194
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,860
Your feelings must be honest.

195
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,500
It's fine. I'll fend them off just by
locating my pitches on the corners.

196
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,410
Let's knock him out.

197
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,830
Haruka...

198
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,850
You sure talk a lot.

199
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,800
Regardless of how it appears,
you see it squarely with the mind's eye.

200
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,670
You must not be hasty.

201
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,410
Wait for the mind to be fulfilled.

202
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,300
Wait for the arrow to be released.

203
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,130
Should I play then ?

204
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
What ?

205
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Huh ?

206
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,200
Catcher.

207
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,180
Kunimi ?

208
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,880
Can you actually catch ?

209
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,550
Probably.

210
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,300
You shouldn't bother, if you
don't want to get embarrassed.

211
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,730
You don't want to pitch
with all your strength ?

212
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,680
Or do you just want to save
an excuse in case you lose ?

213
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,930
Interesting.

214
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,820
Once released, the
arrow will never return.

215
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,070
You must have no regrets.

216
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,100
It smells nice.

217
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,700
I hope you don't regret it.

218
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,710
Make me.

219
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,500
Wow...

220
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,900
Even when you're pitching at full strength,
you're locating your pitches well.

221
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,130
It looks like I won't get injured.

222
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,300
All right, Kunimi ! You're 
the catcher and hitting ninth.

223
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay.

224
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,800
Now, let's play.

225
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,910
Good luck.

226
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,360
Yeah !

227
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,350
Sorry, Atsushi.
It just happened this way.

228
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,930
Hey, Hiro.

229
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,700
Hideo.

230
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,480
Hiro, you're not there ? Hideo ?

231
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,950
Maybe he's secretly 
watching porn by himself ?

232
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,390
He must be wearing headphones ?

233
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,450
0:07:16.00 0:07:17.00  

234
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,950
I'm going to hit a big one !

235
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,900
Listen, Nabe, we're going to finish them off in an instant !

236
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,910
Come on !

237
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,250
Okay...

238
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,940
What's this pitch ?

239
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
All right ! It's gone through !

240
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,550
Nice job, second baseman !

241
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,580
Nice batting...

242
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,950
Safe !

243
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,280
That's right ! You just need to hit it on the ground !

244
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
After all, we have guys who run faster than the track team guys.

245
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,440
Don't worry !

246
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,900
Just watch, Koga.

247
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,500
I'll show you how undeserving 
of your support these guys are.

248
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,940
That guy...!

249
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,770
All right ! Hitting fourth,
it's third baseman, Akagi !

250
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,570
Hey, second run !

251
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,430
It's still early !

252
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,070
That's right.

253
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,170
I got it. I got it. I got it. 
I got it. I go it. I got it. I got it.

254
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,490
Out !

255
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,700
Third run !

256
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,950
All right, follow the lead !

257
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,500
Out ! Three outs ! Change !

258
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,500
Not bad for a start.

259
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
All right, take the field.

260
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Yeah !

261
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,690
Kunimi, you'll be fine 
even if you get injured.

262
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,860
Okay, Kawamura.

263
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,900
You can call me Hikari.

264
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,460
How was it ?

265
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,700
Yeah, it went well.

266
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,500
It's probably because you were there.

267
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,070
My mind was at peace.

268
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,400
I see.

269
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm getting hungry.

270
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,730
Okay. Let's go eat
some okonomiyaki.

271
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,910
Hey, can't you throw back faster ?

272
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,950
Sorry. My arm is weak.

273
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,940
Should we decide on signs ?

274
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,990
You can throw a curveball, too, right ?

275
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,940
That's more than those guys deserve.

276
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,890
I'll get some change back 
even if I only throw fastballs.

277
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,270
Okay.

278
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,880
Now, let's score 
some runs, one by one.

279
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,680
Yeah !

280
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,590
Play ball !

281
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,160
Strike !

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,550
I can't hit that...

283
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,650
You can hit it.

284
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,150
Huh ?

285
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,620
Humans evolve.

286
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,570
Things are just starting.

287
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,410
It's possible to make a comeback, too.

288
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,430
Let's focus !

289
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,050
You should focus.

290
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,500
Hey, hey, soccer club...

291
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,540


292
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,770
Hiro, you're playing baseball, after all.

293
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,640
I'm playing catcher. 
It's not like I'm pitching.

294
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,140
The only thing you have is baseball talent.

295
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,580
That makes me mad.

296
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,660
Oh, did that offend you ?

297
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,630
It's the way the soccer club plays.

298
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,930
They're just fooling around, right ?

299
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,610
How can you say that so disinterestedly ?

300
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,510
Next episode of H2,
"Only Baseball is Different."

301
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,120
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
