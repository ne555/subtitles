Presented by Central Anime

2
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,300
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,420
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:47,150
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,160
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,100
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,170
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,240
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,740
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,250

 Episode 09

14
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,400
God Must Have Wanted To See It

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,620
Got him !

16
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,890
What ?

17
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,420
Now, Senkawa High School 
has a big scoring opportunity.

18
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,790
The ace striker, Kine, 
does his super drive shot !

19
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,890
"Not a Baseball Club..."

20
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,700
What ?

21
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,870
"...Fan Club," fight !

22
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,040
Oh !

23
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,700
Fight, oh, fight, oh, fight, oh, fight, oh... 

24
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,470
That messes up my rhythm.

25
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,120
Baseball Fan Club, fight !

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Fight ! Fight !

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,050
She's so cute.

28
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,490
Koga...

29
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,860
Fight, fight.
 One, two, one, two.

30
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,560
We have to put up this many again ?

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,550
That's right. With one more member, we get upgraded from "fan club" to an official club.

32
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,990
I'm actually more interested in soccer, to tell the truth.

33
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,830
No, if you're Japanese, it should be "chazuke" and baseball.

34
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,680
But no one will probably
see this poster here.

35
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,950
Principal's Office

36
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,550
It's really coming down now.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,130
Rain...

38
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,110
Yeah. It's supposed to
be sunny tomorrow.

39
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh.

40
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,600
Finally, on the powerhouse Meiwa
Daiichi High School Baseball Club...

41
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,450
...an emerging first year star who hits cleanup...

42
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,700
...and is the second son of the 
Tachibana Liquor and Food Store...

43
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,890
...Tachibana Hideo, age 16, will make his debut in high school baseball.

44
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,050
Your narration is long enough.

45
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,700
Well, let's have him flourish for now.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,750
You're the 
hero !

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,750
The hot
springtime
of youth

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,750
Now
play ball !

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,750
Back up the spirit

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,750
Baseball Fan Club is Looking For New Members !

51
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,210
I hate high school baseball.

52
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,110
What ? It's not going to
become an official club ?

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,150
By the Principal's decision ?

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,500
What's going on ?

55
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,710
Well, I mean...

56
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,310
To explain...

57
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,700
It's the Principal's decision.

58
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,300
The Principal's decision ? 
Is that even valid ?

59
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,120
It can't be. No way.

60
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,730
Um, where are you going ?

61
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,370
I'm going to ask the Principal why he isn't making the Baseball Fan Club an official club.

62
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,240
But the Principal is on a field trip and won't return till next week.

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,350
The Principal is on a field trip ?

64
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,560
And won't return till next week ?

65
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,250
What's going on ?

66
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,510
Um, well...

67
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,820
The Principal is on a field trip.

68
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,500
Safe !

69
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,800
Meiwa Ichi

70
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,800
Eikou

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Meiwa Ichi

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Mikami

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Nakajima

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Furukawa

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Tachibana

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Tamura

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Murabe

78
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,890
This is what he does
in his first at-bat...


79
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,450
He sure isn't cute.

80
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,550
He should get more nervous in his first at-bat of his first game.

81
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,250
How is your effort to turn a fan club into an official club going for you ?

82
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,590
We haven't been able to contact the principal, so I can't say anything.

83
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,910
Either way, it's too late for 
this year, so I'm not flustered.

84
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,990
With Hideo in it, this lineup is the
 best in the region, without a doubt.

85
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,000
If you were pitching, how many runs could you keep them to ?

86
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
How many runs ?
I wouldn't give up any runs.

87
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,700
Well, assuming that I will 
give up two hits to Hideo...



88
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,110
...the rest would be kept to just one blooper, and it would be a three-hit shutout.

89
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,270
You're so confident.

90
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,100
Sure.

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,110
That's all I have, after all.

92
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,980
I'm happy about your elbow.

93
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,220
Yeah.

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,800
If you had only had it examined at a proper hospital first...

95
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,940
God must have wanted to see it.

96
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,500
The match between
Hideo and me, I mean.

97
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,710
Kunimi !

98
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,120
Coming !

99
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
Tell Hideo.

100
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,230
If he wants to go to the 
Koushien, now is his chance.

101
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Meiwa Ichi

102
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Eikou


103
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,000
Even without their ace pitcher...

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,060
...the reserve pitcher throws a shutout and they win in a called game.

105
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,360
Meiwa surely is impressive. They have a deep lineup.

106
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,720
We don't have time to be envious.

107
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,500
We will be short of members once the third years leave after the summer.

108
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,250
We can't expect much from people...

109
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,160
...who haven't already joined a 
club and are just fooling around.

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,020
Should we recruit promising ones from other clubs ?

111
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,690
Hmm...

112
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,560
What's wrong ?

113
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,460
Nothing.

114
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,690
Shoot !

115
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,690
He got it ! Genius Kine's ultra hyper turbo shot !

116
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,550
I've been in contact with a few people since, but I haven't received a favorable response.

117
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,040
The major issue is that
we're not an official club.

118
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,360
Goal !

119
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,750
Goal !

120
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,500
Shut up.

121
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,720
How about it ? If you bow and beg, I might be willing to lend a hand.

122
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,630
It's a piece of cake for me to play for two clubs at the same time.

123
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,950
Playing on two clubs at the same time will be difficult.

124
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,700
We have to go to the Koushien in the spring and summer.

125
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,730
In the fall, we have the Nationals, too.





126
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,000
If you're going to play soccer just in
 the winter, then you might be able to.

127
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,480
 Stop joking.

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,510
He hasn't sharpened his punning skills, it seems.

129
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,560
What are you talking about ?

130
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,560
Just think hard about what I offered.

131
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,090
Let's ignore him -
bases loaded with no outs.

132
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,950
Fine Arts Room

133
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,500
I guess the rumor that the Fine Arts Club uses a nude model is just a rumor.

134
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,250
Huh ?

135
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,250
Yanagi from Kita Junior High ?

136
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,470
That second baseman ?

137
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

138
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,000
In junior high, I saw lots of second basemen from different teams...

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,850
...but his defense was
the most memorable.

140
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,650
He sure was a
great second baseman.

141
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,630
He ran fast, and he was a tough out at the plate, too.

142
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,290
You must have mistaken him with someone else.

143
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,500
There's no mistaking him.

144
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,110
Yanagi.

145
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,000
See ?

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,710
Yeah, it's him.

147
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,630
He's Yanagi from Kita Junior High.

148
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,300
Kunimi and Noda ?

149
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,120
Why are you in this school ?

150
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,810
What do you mean why ?

151
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,410
You didn't know that this school doesn't have a baseball club ?

152
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,920
Oh, I quit baseball after junior high.

153
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,460
You quit ?

154
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,800
Did you get injured ?
Was it your elbow ?

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
Was it your back ?

156
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,430
Did you have it checked 
at a proper hospital ?

157
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,050
It wasn't Uetake Clinic, was it ?

158
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,430
That's not it.
I'm not injured anywhere.

159
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,720
Then why did you quit ?

160
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,350
It's such a waste !

161
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,650
I made a promise with my father.


162
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,650
Your father ?

163
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,430
Yeah. I promised him that I'd play baseball through junior high and quit after that.

164
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,430
Why did you make such a promise ?

165
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,710
Didn't you play baseball 
because you loved it ?

166
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,690
I love baseball.

167
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,550
Then play with us.

168
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,060
Right now, we're just a fan club, but 
we'll definitely make it an official club.

169
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,610
My father won't let me.

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,590
Your father shouldn't matter ! 
You should do what you want to do !

171
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,620
You can say that because you don't know my father.

172
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:05,860
But...

173
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,870
Yanagi.

174
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,250
Kunimi, Noda, it's a waste for you to be in a school like this, too.

175
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,000
You should aim for the Koushien at a 
school that has an official baseball club.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,630
Bye.

177
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,390
Wait, Yanagi.

178
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,590
His father ?

179
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,760
Do you believe that ?


180
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,910
He's as much of
a baseball idiot as us.

181
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,000

182
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,300

183
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,300
( Note - Can be read as "Hero" )

184
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
High School Baseball Regional Preliminary

185
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
Hero of Meiwa Ichi

186
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
Tachibana

187
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
Homeruns in back-to-back games.
Third Homer.
First Year Cleanup Batter,
Tachibana Hideo

188
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,100
Wow. I heard he was good...

189
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,950
...but when it's in such big print, it feels as though he's someone I don't actually know.

190
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,700
He's definitely the
Hide-chan that you know.

191
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,650
Hideo equals Hero.

192
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,810
His parents must be happy that he 
turned out to be the same as his name.

193
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,900
You must be happy, too.

194
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,680
Your daughter is shining,
just like her name.

195
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,690
I was chosen as "Miss Meiwa" 
of the incoming students this year.

196
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120


197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,910
That's not because of your name. You just inherited my beauty.

198
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,040
Oh.

199
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,450
What's happened 
with the other hero ?

200
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,500
What ?

201
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Hero equals Hiro.

202
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,170
What happened since ?

203
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,110
Huh ? About what ?

204
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,340
What do you mean, "about what" ?
 It goes without saying !

205
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,150
The principal returned from his trip, right ?

206
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,860
Um...he did return.

207
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,190
So ?

208
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:55,680
Well, we talked to him through a teacher, but he won't meet with us.

209
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,510
What's going on ?

210
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,940
Um, well...

211
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,650
I mean...

212
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,480
He wouldn't meet with us.

213
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,640
Then we should approach him directly.

214
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,700
Principal's Office

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,110
So ?

216
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,990
What brings you here ?

217
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,850
Is it true that the fan club cannot become
an official club because of your directive ?

218
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
It's true.

219
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,450
Why ?

220
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,990
I hate high school baseball.

221
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,430
It makes me sick just
looking at the uniform.

222
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,710
You can prohibit a club activity just
because of your personal preferences ?

223
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,550
The school brochure states that 
this school has no baseball club.

224
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,620
If you want to play baseball, 
you can just go to another school.

225
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,550
That's not the issue.

226
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,690
Anyway, as long as I'm the principal here, there will be no baseball club at this school.

227
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,870
You should give it up.

228
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,500
Are you transferring to some
other school in the near future ?

229
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,310
Not likely.

230
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,100
Has there been any voice
of concern from the PTA ?

231
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,450
Everyone is happy with my educational philosophy.

232
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,460
Okay then.

233
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Let's go.

234
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,020
...?

235
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,410
You...

236
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,780
I'm not giving up. We'll return after we explore our options.

237
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,050
That's not it.


238
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,890
Aren't you going to ask why
I hate high school baseball ?

239
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,400
No. It's probably a
silly reason, anyway.

240
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,500
70 Years Since Establishment

241
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,500
The History of Sousei Prefectural High School

242
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,500
- The Overview of the School -

243
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,380
Sousei High School ?

244
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,450
Our generation might not know...

245
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,340
...but all high school baseball fans over
the age of 20 probably heard the name.

246
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,810
Oh, that school that lost a no-hitter with the score of 0-30 in the summer Koushien tournament.

247
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,120
Yeah. That was my
 father's high school.

248
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,150
It seems that the school was 
academically well-regarded...

249
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,120
...so Sousei High School graduates could feel proud of their hometown.

250
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,780
But ten years ago...

251
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,250
Sousei High School

252
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,950
It appeared in the Koushien by pure luck.

253
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,050
Since then, they talk about that game whenever the topic of Sousei comes up...

254
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,580
...no matter where you are in this country.

255
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,650
People might not know that the school was well-regarded academically...

256
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,860
...but they know about that 30-0 game.

257
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,450
The school tradition that my father 
and other graduates built over time...

258
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,500
...went down the drain 
with that one game.

259
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,390
I see.

260
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,830
The Koushien has become a taboo subject at my home.

261
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,940
I can understand the feeling.

262
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,500
But it's wrong not to
let you play baseball.

263
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,350
No matter who says what,
your father should feel proud.

264
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,390
You can't go to the Koushien on just 
pure luck, without making any effort.

265
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,120
That's true.

266
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,650
While studying hard, the players maximized their practice time...

267
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,000
...and somehow managed to reach the Koushien.

268
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,700
Your father, of all people, needs to understand how hard that is.

269
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,630
He understands,
but he still can't accept it.

270
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,130
It may be the same
high school baseball...

271
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,650
...but opponents are often 
professional baseball prep schools...

272
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,650
...that gather baseball recruits from all over the country.

273
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,800
Playing against an opponent like that all of a sudden...

274
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,800
Moron ! It's just a matter-of-course 
that the playing field is not level !

275
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,650
Climate, environment, facilities, the way 
the players are recruited, the coaches.

276
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,650
They all differ.

277
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,760
But if you keep using that as an excuse, you can't have a national tournament.

278
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,490
Everyone should feel proud.

279
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,270
There's no shame in
 going to the Koushien.

280
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,390
What did he say ?

281
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,170
What ?

282
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,830
You met my father, right ?

283
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,650
Your father...?

284
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,040
Aren't you going to ask why
I hate high school baseball ?

285
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,560
You swing as though you're going to hit the ball with your hips.

286
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,250
Swing from your hips. 
And swing all the way through.

287
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,150
Moriya, don't twist your wrist.

288
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,870
Principal Yanagi...

289
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,130
That was really surprising.

290
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,170
So now we know that there is only one obstacle left.

291
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,610
It's less troublesome that way.

292
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,640
The opponent seems pretty tough.

293
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,760
Yeah.

294
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,120
Now, how are we going to go after him ?

295
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,060
Everyone seems to be working hard.

296
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,550
Hi. Are you going to
put up more posters ?

297
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,530
Yes.

298
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,690
If they're going 
to tear them down...

299
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,990
...I'm going to put up more.

300
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,050
Act before thinking, huh ?

301
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,150
We're not good at thinking things through, after all.

302
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Clang !

303
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,760
Um, I just imagined myself 
on a big field hitting a big one.

304
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,120
A big field...

305
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,230
Clang !

306
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,830
All right, me, too !

307
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,650
Clang !
 It went over the center fielder !

308
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,310
Clang !
 A hit to left field !

309
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,350
Clang !
 A homerun hitting the center field display !

310
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,250
A homerun to clean up all the runners !

311
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,380
This is still usable.

312
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,980
Sorry. I'll do it.

313
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,070
That ball...

314
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,600
Since we don't receive club funding, these
are all precious, but this is a bit too worn out.

315
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,450
Shall I ask my father ?

316
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,460
Huh ?

317
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,380
My father and the chairman of the PTA of this school are longtime friends.

318
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,890
If we approach from there...

319
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,850
Moron ! I don't want to 
get help from adults !

320
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,170
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,720
Is what I would say...

322
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,830
Our opponent is an adult, too. It might be a good idea.

323
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,670
Ask him. I'll count on you.

324
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,980
Hey, hey ! Lower your waist.

325
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,510
You almost got it !

326
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,930
This one is for the left fielder !

327
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,850

335
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:29,580
Notes:
Kine Joke: The joke here again is a homophone kind, so it's not really translatable.  What he says is "It's a piece of cake for me to play concurrently on two clubs, and my child is a four year-old." The "my child..." part is the homophone joke.

Another phonic joke that is totally banal. To "stop" is "yosu / yose / yoshite," and there's a common Japanese female name, "yoshiko," so Kine combines the two sounds.

 And another phonic joke. "Think about it" is "kangaete oke" and Kine turns the "oke / oki" part into "Okinawa."

336
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:32,480
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

337
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:36,410
Notes:
"Hideo" also can be read as "Hero" or "Eiyuu." 
"Hikari" means "light."
 Kunimi's first name, as you recall, is "Hiro." Hiro and Hero
 sound similar, of course.

338
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:40,330
...rather than the footsteps that


 sound further and further away.

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,160
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

348
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:06,140
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

349
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:14,260
...rather than losing our time to regret.

350
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,660
Happiness is not something...

351
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,490
...that someone does for me.

352
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:31,060
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

353
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,000
How's it going ? You're trying to turn the
fan club into an official club going, right ?

354
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,000
You're trying to turn the fan club into an actual club going, right ?

355
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,340
What do you mean "how" ? That stubborn principal !

356
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,030
You asked the chairman of the PTA, right ?

357
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,320
I didn't want to get help from adults, but our opponent is an adult, too.

358
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,740
I can't be choosy with my methods.

359
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,700
Oh, well.

360
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,760
But...

361
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,490
What happened ?

362
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,400
That principal set an outrageous condition.

363
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,200
Next episode of H2 is,
"Things Are Not Turning Out Well..."

364
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,800
Next episode of H2 is

365
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,800
Things Are Not Turning Out Well...

366
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,800
Look forward to it !

367
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,300
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

368
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,950
