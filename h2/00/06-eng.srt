9
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,470


10
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,710
Strike two !

11
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,300
It's fine.

12
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,450
I assure you, that except for the forkball, he has great control.

13
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,370
Strike ! Batter out !

14
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,000
Why ?

15
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,780
What a guy ! All of a sudden, we're only three runs up.

16
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,050
I think I was a little
late on the pitch.

17
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,720
Yeah, a little.

18
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,160
Hey, Akagi.

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,710
Sorry for being late.

20
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,650
How are you doing ?

21
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,910
Are you winning, as promised ?

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,300
Oh, 8-5. You're winning.

23
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,500
Good.

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,680
Leave it to me, Akagi.

25
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to write about this game in our article and spread it all over the school.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,060
Hey, make sure to take photos of just how pathetic the Fan Club guys are.

27
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,530
Sure.




28
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,580
Hey, Akagi, did you actually 
score eight runs off of that pitcher ?

29
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,390
The Soccer Club is really impressive.

30
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,200
Hey, don't just stand there !

31
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,900
You should get the bat 
out and make contact !

32
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,580
It's impossible.

33
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,160
What ?

34
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,600
Unless you're a maniac who swings the bat every day from morning to night.

35
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,780
Besides, it doesn't look like he's throwing at full strength yet.

36
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,790
We can't lose this game.

37
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,000
Starting with the newspaper club,
I've made big declarations everywhere.

38
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,380
We are still winning by three runs.

39
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,870
I should mention. I haven't been throwing my best stuff, either.

40
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,690
Strike ! Batter out !

41
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,880
What's going on ?

42
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,170
I'm telling you. It's Kunimi Hiro.

43
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,660
He's the son of an employee 
at my father's company, right ?

44
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,640
He won the regional
tournament two years in a row.

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,150
Seninan Junior High's ace pitcher.

46
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,150
What ?

47
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,270
If you like baseball,
you'd know his name !

48
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,850
I'm a high school baseball fan.

49
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,640
Oh, I see.

50
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,800
So who's that catcher ?

51
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,000
Noda Atsushi.

52
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,000
He's the catcher for, and
best friend of Kunimi Hiro.

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,610
I didn't realize that they 
were such a great battery.

54
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,610
Then it's not out of question 
for us to go to the Koushien !

55
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,100
What ?

56
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,060
Right ? Right ?
Right ? Right ? Right ?

57
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,950
Well, um...

58
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,700
If it's an unofficial fan club, 
we can't even enter the preliminaries.

59
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,550
Besides...

60
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,010
Besides ?

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,410
If I recall, Kunimi Hiro hurt his
elbow and can't pitch anymore.

62
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,680
Yeah, that's the rumor.

63
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,510
Strike ! Batter out ! Change !

64
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,840
Who hurt his elbow ?

65
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,200
That's the rumor, though.

66
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,190
Hey, Akagi, how did you score eight runs off of that pitcher ?

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,490
Give me the details later.

68
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,040
Hey.

69
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,030
It's getting a little interesting, isn't it ?

70
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,300
Yes.

71
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,490
There's no way I'll give
 up hits to these guys.

72
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,350
After all, I am...

73
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
...the ace pitcher hitting fourth !

74
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,460
Wow ! So cool, Kine !

75
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,450
Strike !

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,820
Wow ! Cool !

77
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,030
How's your elbow ?

78
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,060
Who knows ?

79
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,740
If it breaks down in a silly game like this, you'll get laughed at.

80
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,800
By who ?

81
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,510
You aren't saying you'll quit, are you ?

82
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,350
You're a man, aren't you ? 
You shouldn't give up midway.

83
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,640
When you fall, you fall forward.

84
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,530
Fix your elbow with your willpower.

85
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,700
That's what you said ?

86
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
What ?

87
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,590
To a guy who was told by the doctor that
his elbow would only last for three months ?

88
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,060
As always, you're hard on Hiro.

89
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,660
I mean...

90
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,200
Otherwise, you couldn't have quit baseball.

91
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:09,900
Or if she had really shown you sympathy
and tried to talk you into quitting baseball...

92
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,130
...wouldn't you have done that ?

93
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,200
You wouldn't.

94
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,380
You would have 
continued to play baseball.

95
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,580
Until your elbow broke down.

96
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,130
Hikari knows you really well.

97
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,600
She said what she said because
she was really worried about you.

98
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,650
What about your back ?

99
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,920
It should be okay
for another two innings.

100
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,820
Thanks to the butterfly practice.

101
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,180
Are you having fun 
at the swimming club ?

102
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,600
Yeah.

103
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,910
After all, there are girls in swimsuits all around me.

104
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,700
Moreover, they're wearing the really
tight-fitting competitive swimming suits.

105
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,910
It's definitely paradise.

106
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,550
But that's all there is.

107
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,020
Is that it ?

108
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,060
That's it.

109
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
This is it !

110
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,470
Is this okay ?

111
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,600
Strike ! Batter out !

112
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,340
Change !

113
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,650
It's a great game.

114
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,100
That guy is impressive !

115
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,970
Yeah.

116
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,090
He's good.

117
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,780
For the baseball fans out there,
let's create a great climax.

118
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,640
Yeah.

119
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,170
Yeah, I got it.

120
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,720
That was like a real baseball club.

121
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,400
This is the first and the last day.

122
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,340
Today is the last, huh ?

123
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,420
If I knew that you were a baseball fanatic, I'd have a way of dealing with you.

124
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,100
First, away, on the edge.

125
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,330
Strike !

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,080
That was a good location.

127
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,550
If it's called a strike, that's lucky for us.

128
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,670
Then the next pitch is 
bait to get him to foul off.

129
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,760
Strike two !

130
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,340
Hm ?

131
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,240
You don't have to hold back. Just go ahead and hit it.

132
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm waiting for a curveball.

133
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,030
It's probably the next pitch.

134
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,650
Damn you.

135
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,210
You baseball freak !

136
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,220
Oh ?

137
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,210
Yeah !

138
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,320
EYECATCH

139
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,360
Safe !

140
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,660
Hiro knew the curveball was coming, and yet he still missed it...

141
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,250
It's pathetic that a baseball expert 
was struck out by a soccer player...

142
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,200
....and then takes a
base on a passed ball.

143
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,340
That's pathetic.
....and then takes a
base on a passed ball.

144
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,370
That curveball had a
sharp bite for an amateur.

145
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,750
What a sore loser.

146
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,540
Sorry about that. 
I'll be sure to catch it next time.

147
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,730
Well, please just block it with your body.

148
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,200
As long as you don't
let it get by, it's fine.

149
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,020
Got it.

150
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,810
After all, its sharp bite
makes it difficult to catch.

151
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,080
Hiro struck out even though he
knew the curveball was coming.

152
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,040
But...

153
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,430
I know that a sharper-than-expected curveball is coming.

154
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,580
All right.

155
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,470
Just as expected !

156
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,630
8-7...

157
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,270
Down by just one run...

158
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,410
Those two guys are monsters...

159
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,190
Moron. We're just amateurs.

160
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,780
Good going !

161
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,270
Nice job !

162
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,100
I have to be the ace pitcher
hitting fourth, no matter what.

163
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm going to quit the Hakusan Angels
if you're going to let Tachibana hit fourth.

164
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,180
Are you okay about losing the ace pitcher, Coach ?

165
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,490
Either you take me, or Tachibana.

166
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,120
Let's make that clear.

167
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,900
...!

168
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,800
I hate baseball !

169
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,170
Dammit !

170
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,090
I hate baseball !

171
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:54,900
Hm ?

172
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,840
What's wrong ?

173
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,240
Bush-league baseball...

174
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,980
Look.

175
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,620
Yeah. Homeruns, maybe ?

176
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,270
It's quite a distance from there.

177
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,030
Are we going to scout good players ?

178
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,630
Soccer Club vs. Fan Club ?

179
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,950
What kind of game is this ?

180
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,700
Hey, which school are you from ?

181
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,810
Senkawa High School.

182
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,550
Senkawa High School's soccer club ?

183
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,470
Could it be that Hiro is pitching ?

184
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,500
It doesn't seem like it.

185
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh ?

186
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,500
Foul !

187
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,330
You can hit that piss-poor curveball !

188
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,250
It was sharp at first, but it has totally lost its edge by now, like an old fart's piss.

189
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,610


190
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,000
Urine curveball, I meant.

191
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's the same thing.

192
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,700
Those comedians are from the
soccer club and the swimming club ?

193
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,490
That's what it should be, but...

194
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,450
Shortstop !

195
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,700
All right !








196
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,450
What're you doing ?! It was a
slow-roller right in front of you !

197
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,550
Hey, how dare you talk like that to your senior !

198
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,500
I'm a soccer player. I don't deserve to be yelled at for juggling the ball.

199
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,300
Calm down. This isn't the
time for internal bickering.

200
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,750
With two outs in the ninth inning, we're still up by one run.

201
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,700
One more out to go.

202
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,420
One more...

203
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,760
That's right.
If we get one more runner...

204
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,170
Life isn't that easy.

205
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,610
This will be the end of it !

206
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,500
Bad one.

207
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,890
It got through !

208
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,150
He pulled it off !

209
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,030
All right ! Runners on first 
and second with two outs !

210
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,120
It seems to be getting exciting.

211
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,010
I feel like I've seen
that pitcher somewhere.

212
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,200
What do you think, Mr. Analyst, Tachibana ?

213
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
You know it.

214
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,550
In junior high, I had better numbers for batting average, homeruns, and RBIs.

215
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,100
But Hiro had more
game winning walk-off hits.

216
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,270
He becomes the most 
dependable in the ninth inning.

217
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,610
Give it your best, Kunimi !

218
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,670
Hit it out, Kunimi !
 Hit it out, Kunimi !

219
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,430
Dammit !

220
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,090
Dammit !

221
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:47,820
Ugh !

222
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,170
Out ! Game set !

223
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:58,870


224
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,390
The Baseball Fan Club
lost to the Soccer Club !

225
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,400
That's pathetic !

226
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,760
Yay !

227
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,120
That was a piece of cake !

228
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,560
Fune !

229
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,900
You're Fune, right ?

230
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,970
What is it, Namihei ?

231
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,350
Long time no see, Fune.

232
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm Kine !

233
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,230
Now, let's write the article.

234
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,510
It's going to be a great article.

235
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,650
Do you have any complaints ?

236
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,200
No...

237
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,740
Dammit ! 
We had a chance...

238
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,650
Don't worry.
We played a great game.

239
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,600
Right, Kuni...

240
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,000
Kunimi...?

241
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,190
Oh ?

242
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,650
I was finally starting to
forget how your pitch felt.

243
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,890
It's a great nuisance, so we should really make this the end of it.

244
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:30,900
Yeah.

245
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,380
You aren't saying you'll quit, are you ?

246
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,600
If you take away baseball, 
you have nothing left.

247
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,920
This is the end of it.

248
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,390
Next Episode

249
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,180
Hiro, aren't you going to
continue playing baseball ?

250
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,800
I said I played my last game.

251
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,670
But...

252
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,510
But ?

253
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,050
Their manager is really devoted.

254
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,060
She's trying to gather members and turn it into an official club.

255
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,490
Oh ? Sounds like a good manager.

256
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,870
But really, the outsiders are fussy. Especially that Kine guy.

257
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,730
Hm ?

258
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,510
I'm going to punish him for sure.

259
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,820
Next episode of H2, 
"Are You Going to Quit the Fan Club ?"

260
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,050
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

261
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,030
