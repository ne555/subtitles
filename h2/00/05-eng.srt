10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,550


11
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,080
Do You Require a Registration Form ?


12
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,400
Do You Require a Registration Form ?

13
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,850
Fan Club
Soccer Club
 Teams

14
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,320
Now, leadoff batter,
let's get on base !

15
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,900
Kine is in top shape.

16
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,670
He begins to pitch in the
bottom of the fourth inning.

17
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,510
Five, topping, soba !

18
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,990
Hit by pitch.

19
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,270
I'm sorry.
It slipped through my fingers.

20
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,090
I'm fine.

21
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,170
Maybe "five topping soba"
wasn't the right one.

22
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,820
Pot, sticker, rice !

23
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,650
Ball.

24
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,970
Sautéed, green onion, liver !

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,800
Ball.

26
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,780
Grilled, beef, meal !

27
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,840
Ball.

28
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,200
Ma, po, tofu !

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,900
Ball.

30
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,850
Four balls.

31
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,980
A scoring chance !

32
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,240
Oh my, what's happening to you, Kine ?

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,070
Oh, I see.

34
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,490
Ah, shall we have ramen ?

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,000
The fact that you made the
 call means it's on you, right ?

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,800
What ? It's on me ?

37
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,300
It's okay.
I'll order a mapo tofu.

38
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,670
Ball four.

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,440
Great ! The bases are
loaded with no outs !

40
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,600
Oh, no !

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Kine, hang in there !

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,320
Now, the bases are loaded with no outs. Kine is in a tight spot.

43
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,650
From the set position...

44
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,870
...he throws the first pitch !

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,100
Strike !

46
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,210
...!

47
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,600
Then the second pitch !

48
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,490
That's similar to Hiro's pitching motion.

49
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,110
Really ?

50
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,920
Come to think of it, that guy 
also hurt his elbow and retired.

51
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Wasn't it the shoulder that
he had acupuncture done on ?

52
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,150
Thank you for waiting.

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,100
It looks delicious !

54
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,120
It's even more so when I realize that it's a treat.

55
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,000
If I were told that my elbow would break down in three months if I kept pitching...

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,790
...I wonder if I would 
feel like eating ramen.

57
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,990
Strike ! Batter out !

58
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,450
Kine is impressive !

59
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,840
Three consecutive strikeouts !

60
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,400
Kine escapes the jam.

61
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,060
He's thoroughly toying with them.

62
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,330
Ball.

63
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,350
But honestly, baseball
is such a boring sport.

64
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,790
Really. You get to sit in 
the dugout during offense.

65
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,760
It would be unthinkable in soccer.

66
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,190
My body is going numb from inactivity.

67
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,430
Ball three.

68
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,200
Come on ! Come on !

69
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
I wouldn't want to walk.

70
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Yeah !

71
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,820
Don't worry !
It was just bad luck !

72
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,930
This isn't baseball.

73
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,630
This isn't baseball at all.

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Thank you for coming.

75
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,990
Thanks for the meal.

76
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,970
Um, yeah.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But...

78
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,900
I never thought that the
battery-mates from junior high...

79
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,650
...Hiro and Noda would go to Senkawa
High School, which has no baseball club.

80
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,200
Mr. "swimming club member who
just happened to be passing by,"...

81
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,100
...you know a lot about baseball ?

82
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,150
I'm Noda, who was a catcher, but hurt his back and retired...

83
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,350
...then came to Senkawa because it doesn't have a baseball club...

84
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,100
...joined the swimming club to rehabilitate his back, and is practicing the butterfly style.

85
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,500
That's such a straightforward self-introduction.

86
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,900
One out with a runner on second.

87
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,380
The batter is Kunimi,
a catcher, hitting ninth.

88
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,590
I suppose we'll have to place our hope in the next batter, Nabe.

89
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,390
Leave it to me.

90
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,960
Oh ?

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,210
Wow...

92
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,320
It's a homerun.

93
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,180
You can't brag about hitting a
homerun off such a lousy pitch.

94
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,440
Yeah. It's embarrassing,
so don't tell anyone.

95
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,950
Humph.

96
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,550
Call me Hikari.

97
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,600
8 to 1.

98
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,730
Are you frustrated ?

99
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,900
Of course.

100
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,270
But it's not about losing.

101
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,500
Meow.

102
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,790
Ball. Ball four !

103
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,170
That was close. 
My forkball dropped too much.

104
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,890
Again ?

105
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,700
Ball.

106
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,490
Once again, he's intentionally loading
the bases and then striking out the side.

107
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,650
Aw...

108
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,060
Ball. Ball four.

109
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,960
Hm ?

110
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,180
What are you doing ?

111
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,210
Warming up.

112
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,200
Ball.

113
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,410
That's strange.

114
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,980
Ball.

115
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,910
I'm borrowing the mitt.

116
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,990
Play catch with me.

117
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,400
Huh ?

118
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
Ball three.

119
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,010
Ball. Ball four.

120
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,630
Oh, no !

121
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,300


122
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,660
Kawamura.

123
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,500
Huh ?

124
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,400
Kunimi Hiro, a first year on general admission...

125
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,120
...is leaving the soccer
club as of this moment.

126
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,610
Then sign this withdrawal form.

127
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,890
Here, right ?

128
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,420
Do I need a stamp ?

129
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,100
There's no need.

130
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,090
...?

131
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,440
Do you require a registration form ?

132
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,700
Um, well, no.

133
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,600
First, can you give us your name ?

134
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,630
Kunimi Hiro.

135
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,800
And Noda Atsushi.

136
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,650
Kunimi Hiro ?

137
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,650
If possible, in this bases
loaded scoring opportunity...

138
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,290
...it would be great if you could use me as a pinch-hitter.

139
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,510
Um, sure, with pleasure.

140
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,090
I guess I'll have to be the catcher.

141
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,290
It's regrettable.

142
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,650
If you had hung in there for a year...

143
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,990
...you would have gotten a pretty good position with our soccer club, too.

144
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,880
The score is 8-1 in the 
bottom of the fifth inning.

145
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,900
This crappy game is already over.

146
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,880
In baseball, nothing is over...

147
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,550
...until the last three outs, no matter what the score.

148
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,880
EYECATCH

149
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,460
Hey.

150
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,340
Could it be that "Kunimi" and "Noda" are...

151
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,950
No way.

152
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,680
I didn't think so.

153
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,510
Kunimi Hiro...

154
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,010
I feel like I've heard
his name somewhere.

155
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,290
All right.

156
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,900
I'm going to show you my real stuff.

157
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,880
Wow, cool !

158
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,670
Kine, good luck !

159
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,990
This is my true ability !

160
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,420
Bases-loaded...

161
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,490
...homerun...

162
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,650
One run.

163
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,600
Two runs.

164
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,770
Three runs.

165
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,920
Four runs.

166
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,410
8-5.

167
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,810
I'm going to teach you the fun
of the game without time limits.

168
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,610
It's embarrassing, so don't tell anyone.

169
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,730
Damn him.

170
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,900
Another pinch-hitter.

171
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,450
There are mis-pitches once in a while.

172
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
How about this ?

173
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,390
Foul !

174
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,800
Hooked it.

175
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,800
I didn't think I could 
move my back this easily.

176
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,930
Um...

177
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,230
Are you from the same junior high ?

178
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,460
Yes. From Seinan Junior High.

179
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,490
Seinan Junior High ?

180
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,550
Kunimi and Noda ?

181
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,100
Then you two must be the...

182
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,990
That's right. It's Kunimi Hiro. There's no mistaking it.

183
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,820
No wonder I thought I heard your name somewhere.

184
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,640
Then just as I thought...

185
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,980
That's right.

186
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,550
He's the son of an employee at my father's company.

187
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,300
He gets 5000 yen per
month of allowance.

188
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,600
He spends most of it on porn.

189
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,460
That Kunimi Hiro !

190
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,350
That's me.

191
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,510
Um, well...

192
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,000
Hey, Kunimi, your father works for
Koga Commercial Company, doesn't he ?

193
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,440
Come to think of it, that may
be the company's name.

194
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,550
I knew it !

195
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,420
Um, that's not what
we are talking about.

196
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,290
I mean...

197
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,320
Nice play.

198
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,200
Out !

199
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,760
Damn him...

200
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,990
Hang in there !

201
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,020
Show your fighting spirit !

202
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,650
Give it your best !

203
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,250
Dammit.

204
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,030
Baseball idiot ?

205
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,050
Who are you talking about ?

206
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,050
Me ?

207
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,100
Yes. And...

208
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,660
...Hiro and Noda.

209
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,760
You're all...

210
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,910
...baseball idiots.

211
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,370
We're all baseball idiots, huh ?

212
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,000
Strike ! Batter out !

213
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,470
Three outs ! Change !

214
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,740
Hey, Hikari.

215
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,060
Hm ?

216
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,250
Do you have Kunimi's registration form ?

217
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's see...

218
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,660
Here you go.

219
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,890
...!

220
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,700
Hiro.

221
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,980
Do you need some warm-up pitches ?

222
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,050
Nope.

223
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,200
As for the signs, the rock will be the fastball, and scissors will be the curveball.

224
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,200
There's no paper ?

225
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,490
No.

226
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,200
What's wrong ?
Oh ?

227
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,450
You need more than just
fastballs to go up against us ?
Oh ?

228
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,000
You need more than just
fastballs to go up against us ?

229
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,400
But I'd get bored
calling pitches that way.

230
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,650
And I can't catch it if he throws a 
curveball without giving me a sign first.

231
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,000
Being the baseball idiots that they are,
will they be able to quit baseball so easily ?

232
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,130
Here.

233
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,800
What if it were you ?

234
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,500
I'd still continue to the last,
until my body breaks down.

235
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,700
Hiro is in the soccer club. 
Noda is in the swimming club.

236
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,300
This is my last game.

237
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,650
Mine, too.

238
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,730
Let's begin.

239
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,230
Play !

240
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,100
First...

241
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,650
...this.

242
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,470
What's the call ?

243
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,310
S...strike !

244
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,270
Okay, okay.

245
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,890
W...what is he ?

246
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,600
That's way faster than a regular fastball.

247
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,410
Of course.

248
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,650
They formed the battery...

249
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,950
...on a team that won the junior high
regional tournament two years in a row.

250
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,590
Our school doesn't have a baseball club. Why would such guys come here ?

251
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,540
Right ?

252
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,820
Who knows ?

253
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,650
It's rock.

Notes:
Battery = the regular pairing of a certain catcher and pitcher because they work best together.

The "No paper" line for the signs was probably referring to Hiro's Forkball that he really can't control.

Hiro, you're pitching ?

261
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,870
Yeah. My elbow is doing just fine.

262
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,050
It's the revival of the battery that won the junior high regionals two years in a row.

263
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,090
But this is our last.

264
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,120
Why ?

265
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,010
I can't continue to pitch
and wreck my elbow.

266
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,360
You say so, but you're fired up.

267
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,710
Don't read my feelings.
