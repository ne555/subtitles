2
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,300
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,420
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:47,150
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,160
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,100
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,170
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,240
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,740
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,020

00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,400
 Episode 08

14
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,400
The Elbow is Made of Glass, He Says

15
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,900
If they hear such a sound...

16
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,500
If pitchers hear such a sound on the
mound, they'd just want to run away.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,630
Hey, minor. 
That's a beer vending machine.

18
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,550
Don't worry.
My father asked me to get some.

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,310
Right now, I have no interest in bitter drinks like this.

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Then do you want a Coke ?

21
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,950
You don't know who you'll be playing in 
the summer preliminary tournament yet ?

22
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,470
No.

23
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,940
How's your team this year ?

24
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,500
We're the favorite to win
the tournament of course.

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,900
But as prestigious as Meiwa Daiichi is...

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,400
...it hasn't gotten past the 
semi-finals in the past three years.

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,210
And in the spring invitational, too, it was one of the candidates but ultimately wasn't chosen.

28
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,870
That's because I wasn't there.

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
What about pitchers ?

30
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,170
Including the reserves, 
we have enough pieces.

31
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,650
The only thing is that the ace pitcher, Maruyama, is experiencing some elbow pain.

32
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,390
Elbow...


33
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,800
He's fine.
 He's had it properly looked at.

34
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,680
What was that physician's name ?

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,550
Doctor Uetake.

36
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,450
Yeah.

37
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,900
He says that it's just fatigue...

38
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,500
...so he  should be good to go in the preliminary if he rests it well for several days.

39
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,690
That's good to hear.

40
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,900
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

41
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,900
If your...

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,630
Hm ?

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,270
Um, no, never mind.

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,840
If my elbow were fine, then what ?

45
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,400
Would you have come to my school ?

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
If you and I were
on the same team...

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,020
...the regional tournament would 
become boring for three years.

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,350
I guess you're right.

49
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,310
Just as I thought,
it started to rain again.

50
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,400
The rainy season will be over soon.

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,170
Right.

52
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,930
Oh ?

53
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,700
Kunimi !

54
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,880
Hi.

55
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,900
You run every day ?

56
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,130
Yeah. It's been a habit
of mine for a long time.

57
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,270
Besides, leg strength is important for every sport, not just baseball.

58
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,940
Regardless of what I end up doing, it won't be meaningless.

59
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,600
If you haven't decided what you're going to do yet...

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,530
...can you temporarily be the
coach for the Baseball Fan Club ?

61
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,450
Hm ?

62
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,250
If you're just coaching, you
don't have to tax your elbow.

63
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,500
You don't have to do it,
unless you have free time.

64
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,650
I'm not good at telling people what to do.

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,380
Oh, I know.

66
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,350
If you're going to get someone
to coach, Noda would be better.

67
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,740
Noda ?

68
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,550
Yeah.

69
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,100
From pitch-calling to defensive
alignment, the flow of the game.

70
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,920
Catchers always have to keep an eye on all aspects of the game.

71
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,750
Temperamentally, too, he's better suited for the role than a selfish pitcher.

72
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,670
Kunimi.



73
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,550
Hm ?

74
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,110
You don't play any 
position other than pitcher ?

75
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,440
Thanks to my selfish personality.

76
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,000
Anyway, Noda is the best.

77
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,150
Then, I'll ask.

78
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,380
He finally caught up to me.

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,210
Hey...Hiro...!

80
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,650
You should slow down. 
Are you trying to kill me ?

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Good morning.

82
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,250
Hoo...hoo...hoo...

83
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,200
Are you an owl or something ?

84
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,190
What is your relationship to Hiro ?

85
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,500
We attend the same school. 
We only recently met, and that's it.

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,510
That's good.

87
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,960
This guy is a pervert, so you
shouldn't get involved with him.

88
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,900
Hey...

89
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,000
In that respect, as much of a pervert as I am, I'm older and have more self-restraint.


90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,250
So girls are much safer with me.

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,000
Huh ?

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,050
Moreover, this guy has a monthly allowance of just 5000 yen.

93
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,450
But as for me, look.

94
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,200
As you can see, I have cards...

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,710
...and a secret savings account that my wife doesn't know about, so I live quite comfortably.

96
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,710
Hey...

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,510
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime ?

98
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,470
Well, the company's entertainment expenses will pay for it, so you shouldn't feel shy.

99
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,450
...

100
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,050
You can learn a lot by 
going out with an older guy.

101
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,790
Let's see...

102
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,110
Oh, I'm Koga.

103
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,060
Yes, Ms. Koga.

104
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,370
Well, I'll think about it.

105
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,300
You can fire him.

106
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,250
...?

107
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,510
I have to go. I need
to get to school early.

108
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,590
Hm ?

109
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm going to put up some posters to
recruit new members for the Fan Club.

110
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,690
Someone has been tearing them
down no matter how many I put up.

111
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,430
I see.

112
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,970
Good luck. 
Bye, Ms. Koga.

113
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,290
Huh ? Ms. Koga...?

114
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,290
You should look forward to 
getting called in by your boss.

115
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,470
What ?

116
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,000
President Koga's daughter...?

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,300
If you're transferred to a post in some other city, you should go there alone.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,110
It's torn down again.

119
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,270
I'm not going to back down.


120
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,220
Haruka, I'm done here.

121
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,170
Oh, thanks, Asako.
I appreciate it.

122
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,480
But it's probably useless.

123
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,700
You're the hero !

124
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,700
The hot
springtime
of youth

125
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,700
Now play ball !

126
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,700
Hot-blooded

127
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,700
Baseball Fan Club
is Looking For
 New Members !

128
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,700
Baseball is an old people's game. No one's interested.

129
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,010
Then I like old men ?

130
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,060
You like old men ?

131
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,200
You didn't fall for
my father, did you ?

132
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,150
What ? What're you talking about ?

133
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,600
Oh, that's not what
 I'm talking about.

134
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,380
Oh, that's right. 
Show your best stuff, old man.

135
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,620
What was that ?

136
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,040
Um, Noda.

137
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,410
Yeah ?

138
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,150
I have something I want to ask you.

139
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,550
Can you spare some 
time for me after school ?

140
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,400
W...what ?

141
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,550
What...?

142
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,440
No way...
I can't believe it.

143
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,500
Hey, hey ! Come on !

144
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,330
...!

145
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:16,560


146
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,020
Hey, Maruyama.

147
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,250
My elbow...

148
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,080
Hello ? Hello ?

149
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,510
What's wrong, Tachibana ?

150
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,420
No one's here.

151
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,700
Uetake Clinic

152
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,850
The windows are closed 
and the curtains are closed.

153
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,440
They're not supposed
to be closed today.

154
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,500
It can't be helped. Let's have him examined at another hospital.

155
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,830
Goal !

156
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,660
An amazing talent, Kine
has a gold medal right leg.

157
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,600
Huh ? They're...?

158
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,030
Why are those two...?

159
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,300
Hey, Peeping Tom.

160
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,650
Don't scare me.

161
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,650
Just as I thought, 
you're feeling uneasy.

162
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,450
What are you talking about ?

163
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,960
Those two have been bonding since the baseball game the other day.

164
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,320
It can't be true ! There's no way Koga would go out with a guy like him !

165
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,720
Oh, they disappeared.

166
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,780
Where are they ?

167
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,450
Women's Dressing Room

168
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,340
Probably the unoccupied dressing room of the girls' swimming club.

169
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,000
How do you know ?


170
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,510
Noda is good at it.

171
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,860
Taking a girl into the
dressing room, I mean.

172
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,730
W...what ?!



173
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,600
Get out !

174
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,980
So can I really ask you to do it ?

175
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,810
Yeah. As you can see, 
my rehab is going well.

176
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,800
More importantly, there's no way I can turn down your request.

177
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,550
But I had never heard that butterfly-style swimming is good for rehabbing a bad back.

178
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,640
That's what the doctor says, 
so it must be true.

179
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,370
I have to be able to
hit some fungo at least.

180
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,740
Okay, I've got to do one more lap.

181
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,130
Don't call me.

182
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,460
eyecatch

183
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,450
Maruyama hurt his elbow ?

184
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,820
Yeah. Right before the preliminary, we lost our ace pitcher.

185
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,890
But didn't you say that Maruyama's sore elbow was just fatigue ?



186
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,450
That's what that doctor
named Uetake said.

187
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,700
But it turned out differently when they had him examined at the University Hospital.

188
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,200
Dr. Uetake is famous around 
here for sports medicine, right ?

189
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,790
Yeah.

190
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,400
607...

191
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,650
Hey, Hiro. Can you 
get me some beer ?

192
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,370
Sent Onono Imoko to Sui.

193
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,970
608...

194
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,660
Emissaries to Sui return
to Japan via Kudara.

195
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,650
Honey, this is strange !

196
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,870
Hiro is studying.
It's going to rain hard.

197
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,860
What's wrong with him ?

198
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,450
Just let me kill time however I like.

199
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,900
First-Year
Mid-Term
Top 50 Scorers

200
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,610
They should stop doing this sort of thing in this day and age.

201
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,990
But for those who worked hard, it will 
be kind of a reward, don't you think ?

202
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,360
So who worked hard ?

203
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,240
You got into the top 50 just because you guessed right. Don't get too carried away.

204
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,150
You have to narrow 
down the target pitch.

205
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,550
If you swing at everything, you
 won't be able to hit for average.

206
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,400
 "44 Sakurai Kinzou 47..." "45 Nemoto Jun 471" "46 Koga Haruka 452" "47 Kunimi Hiro 449" "48 Koyama Junko 447

207
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,450
Koga Haruka

208
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,450
Kunimi Hiro

209
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,300
Hi. We're neighbors.

210
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,290
Oh, hello.

211
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,680
If I'm just down by three points, I can take the lead in the second term.

212
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,560
Moron.

213
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,840
Huh ?


214
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,200
Haruka had a perfect
 score on one of the exams...

215
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,900
...but she forgot to put her name on it, so she received zero points there.


216
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,200
It's like a superstar who hit a homerun but forgot to step on home plate.

217
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,500
Beaten by 103 points.
It's totally a called game.

218
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,000
And you're down by how many points ?

219
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,420
Don't dodge the question by laughing.

220
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,110
What are these "plate" and "called" about ?

221
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,220
Those are baseball terms. 
It's proof that they love baseball.

222
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,970
Oh.

223
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,810
See ?

224
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,610
Although he doesn't do well in school, he has a baseball brain.

225
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,670
He's going to be a good coach.

226
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,950
Yes.



227
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,060
There's no one at this clinic.

228
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,990
What ?

229
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,320
They went out of business ?

230
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,700
I'm not sure.

231
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,950
But it's been closed for a week or so, and I haven't seen anyone come in or out.

232
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,450
I see...

233
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,250
Uetake Clinic


234
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,420
How much longer are you 
going to be holed up in there ?

235
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,870
Just come out already, crappy father !

236
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,750
Crap and father won't 
come out at the same time.

237
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,750
Crap would have to come out first.

238
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,350
Get it out of there already !

239
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,550
Hiro, you have a call.

240
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,250
From who ?

241
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,060
Hikari.

242
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,150
Hikari ?

243
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,130
Hey, what is it this
early in the morning ?

244
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,830
Hiro, did you read the
newspaper this morning ?

245
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,470
I just got out of the shower.

246
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,900
Read the "society" page now.

247
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,660
What is it ? Did some idol get engaged to a sumo grand champion again or something ?


248
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,890
Just hurry up and read it.

249
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,220
Here it is.

250
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,940
The "society" page ?

251
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,740
Yeah.

252
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:20,470
"Pistol robbery on the rise." "A small 
airplane crashes. Two Japanese found dead."

253
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,560
No, those aren't it.

254
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,550
"Jail sentence for nine people,
including the company president."

255
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,600
"Unlicensed doctor..."

256
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,490
"...arrested" ?

257
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,160
That's it !

258
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,700
Uetake Hiroshi [58]

259
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,700
Unlicensed doctor arrested

260
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,080
"Uetake"...

261
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,700
Hello ?
Hiro, are you listening ?

262
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Hiro ? Hiro ?

263
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Unlicensed...

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Hiro ? Hiro ?

265
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,710
Arrested...

266
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,550
I'm coming over right now.
Wait for me there.

267
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,470
Hiro ? Are you listening, Hiro ?

268
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,400
Exam Room

269
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,900
Exam Room

270
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,990
How did the exams go ?

271
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,800
The elbow is made of glass, he says.

272
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,480
I see.

273
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,000
It's made of glass...

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,100
...but it's bulletproof and won't break even if someone shoots at it.

275
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,870
What ?

276
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,010
They didn't find anything
wrong with my back, either.

277
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,480
Then...

278
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,090
Just as we thought...

279
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,480
Screw that fake doctor, Uetake !

280
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,680
Hey, are you really going to do this ?

281
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,610
Don't you think it's childish ?

282
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,500
No.

283
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,200
This is minimal revenge.

284
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,650
I can't just go quietly.

285
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,290
Be a lookout for us.

286
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,000
No.

287
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,810
Are you going to stop us ?

288
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,760
I'm going to do it, too.

289
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,860
What ?  

290
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,900
Moron

291
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,300
Quack

292
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,800
Liar

293
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,800
Screw you

294
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,700
Dumb ass

295
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Dummy !

296
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,060
Someone's coming !

297
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,080
Ugh !

298
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,090
Ah, I feel content.

299
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,920
Right, Hiro ?

300
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:52,890
Hiro ?

301
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,990
From here on...

302
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,110
...it's something they have to deal with.

303
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,440


304
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,180
What are you going to do ?

305
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,200
About what ?

306
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
You know.

307
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,380
Of course.

308
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,790
If you're seriously aiming for the Koushien, transferring to another school is an option.

309
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,740
Don't you feel that it's shameful to do that at this stage ?

310
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,590
A little.

311
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,270
Do you dislike this school ?

312
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,300
No.

313
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,500
Then let's do the right thing.

314
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,420
It must be fate that both of us came to a school without a baseball club.



315
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,640
It'll be interesting to start from scratch.

316
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,820
Yeah.

317
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,620
We're going to start the history of this school's baseball club.

318
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,020
All right.

319
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,150
The Koushien doesn't matter.

320
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,990
We get to play baseball again.

321
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,160
With our golden battery.

322
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,370
I have no complaints.


323
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,870
Let's surprise those 
powerhouse baseball schools !

324
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,510
All right. Let's do it !

325
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,620
What ? Why ?

326
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,850
Are you all right, Manager ?

327
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,060
Yes, I'm fine.
I have band-aids.

328
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,130
Manager, I'm sorry to say, 
but I have to decline being the coach.

329
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
What ?

330
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,730
I'll be a player.

331
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,330
Player ?

332
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,250
How about that ?

333
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,970
It sounds great.

334
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,270
But what about Kunimi's elbow ?

335
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,380
Noda, don't jam your fingers.

336
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,090
Okay.

337
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,950
Nice sound ! It's amazing !

338
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,870
This is what it is.

339
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,250
That's right. This is what it is.

340
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,300
So this is what it is ?

341
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,620
Okay, I'll throw a forkball now.

342
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,100
No ! Don't do that !

343
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,080
Strike !

Notes:
Hiro Studying: This is probably from Japanese History book. 
As you may know, Sui is a Chinese dynasty circa 581-619, 
and "Onono Imoko" is a famous emissary that Japan sent to Sui.

Rain Superstition: It's a common superstition that there will be a rainfall after something weird happens.

352
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,720

 sound further and further away.

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,170
The star I'm watching today...

361
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,650
...glistened yesterday.

362
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,270
In the town full of things that disappear...

363
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,400
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

364
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:05,380
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

365
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:13,500
...rather than losing our time to regret.

366
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,900
Happiness is not something...

367
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,730
...that someone does for me.

368
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:30,300
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

369
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,080
It's great that you can
play baseball again.

370
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,550
Yeah. I have to catch up again.

371
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,030
Catch up ?

372
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,150
Hideo is now a hero of the high school baseball world, right ?

373
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,870
You'll catch up to him soon.

374
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,130
Of course. I can't wait till 
I face him in a game.

375
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,870
How confident.

376
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,700
That's all I have, after all.

377
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,730
Next episode of H2 is,
"God Must Have Wanted to See It."

378
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,050
Next episode of H2 is

379
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,050
God Must Have Wanted to See It

380
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,050
Look forward to it !

381
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,080
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

382
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,900
