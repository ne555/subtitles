23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,790
Strike ! Batter out !

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,600
That pitch was high.

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,930
Oh, really ?

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,300
Wow, Kine !

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,560
You're cool !

28
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,690
Hi.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
Don't worry.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Let's settle down. 
Things are just starting.



31
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,560
We're doing fine ! Let's score some runs, one by one !

32
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,800
Pull yourself together !
Let's try our best !

33
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,790
What's wrong, catcher ?

34
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,600
You don't seem energetic !

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,540
Let's give it a shout !

36
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,150
Two outs ! Two outs !

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,400
Yeah !

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,950
Bright spring day.

39
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,400
This Sunday afternoon, in the game between Soccer Club and Baseball Fan Club...

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,660
...the Soccer Club is
leading by three runs.

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,920
It's not that I'm
narrating this to anyone.

42
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,670
Strike !

43
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,050
You were right not to
have swung at that pitch.

44
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,310
I guess so...

45
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,230
Maybe it was too fast, even though I said I'd only throw fastballs ?

46
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,200
No wonder you said that you'd get some change back even with just fastballs.
Impressive. No wonder you said that you'd get some change back even with just fastballs.

47
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,650
Right, Kine ?

48
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,770
Here's your change.

49
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,050
I'm going to throw the next one right down the middle.

50
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,990
What's wrong with him ?

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,010
Strike !

52
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,550
This is you as a fifth-grader ?

53
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,600
Yeah, I was like that when
I joined the Hakusan Angels.

54
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,890
You were big.

55
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,680
Really ?

56
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,480
Really.

57
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,150
I mean, Hiro was about 
this height back then.

58
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,210
When we were playing together, 
people thought he was my little brother.

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,100
Hikari's little brother, huh ?

60
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,060
Then it would be Kodama, Nozomi, or Tsubasa...

61
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,770
I'm not a bullet train.

62
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,840
He couldn't measure up to me no matter what we did.

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,520
Hurry, hurry !

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,190
Hey, wait !

65
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,200
Running, tree-climbing, sumo wrestling.

66
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,920
I was better at everything.

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,350
Baseball, too ?

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,500
That's right. Baseball
was the only exception.

69
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,760
He was often taken out to join
my father's bush-league games.

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,530
Not just to fill up the roster,
but rather as a player.

71
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,000
See ?

72
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,900
Back then, I was getting attention as the 
cleanup batter for the Hakusan Angels...

73
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,670
...so I was getting really cocky.

74
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,610
But he struck me out on three pitches.

75
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:41,730
A midget with an oversized uniform took a big motion and threw an unbelievable pitch.

76
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Thanks to that, I, who disliked practice
and had been playing with just pure talent...

77
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,220
...ended up taking practice swings from morning to night for all three years of junior high.

78
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,300
Thus, giving birth to the slugger...

79
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,740
...who will hit cleanup as a first year in the prestigious Meiwa Daiichi club.

80
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,860
Maybe.




81
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,350
But on the whole...

82
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,590
...you have a good record against him throughout the intra-squad games, right ?

83
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,400
There's no ace pitcher who seriously 
crushes his own team's cleanup batter.

84
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,700
When you think about the games you'll be pitching...

85
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,250
...you want your cleanup batter feeling good about himself.

86
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,460
Is that true ?


87
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,110
Hiro isn't that thoughtful though.

88
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,140
Well, either way, an earnest match
between you two will never happen.

89
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,500
Hey, who's he ?





90
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,470
This guy in the back,
who always looks sullen.

91
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,600
Hmm...

92
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,550
Oh, yeah.

93
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,600
He's the guy who was the ace pitcher hitting cleanup until I joined the Hakusan Angels.

94
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,470
An ace pitcher hitting cleanup ?

95
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,830
Yeah.

96
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,000
As I recall...

97
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,800
...his name was something like Fune or Yone.

98
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,930
Kine !

99
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,600
Change !

100
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,090
Wow, Kine !

101
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,920
You're cool !

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,050
Look this way !

103
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,480
He's the best !

104
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,360
They're members of my fan club.

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,040
I didn't ask.

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,410
There'll be at least one
more before summer.

107
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,010
A special member, I mean.

108
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,800
Let's stay focused !

109
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,200
I like baseball better, though.

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,300
Ouch.

111
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,170
It's your turn to hit.

112
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,180
Don't swing at balls, okay ?

113
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,670
Hey, are you listening to me, Kunimi ?

114
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,170
Come to think of it, I've been keeping the same posture for a while now.

115
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,530
Watch the ball well.
It's a lousy pitch.

116
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,640
Ball.

117
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,920
His body...

118
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,150
Hm ?


119
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,200
He's thrusting his body
forward a bit too much.

120
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,210
Oh, you noticed.

121
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,650
If he stays back on his 
back foot a little more...

122
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,500
...he'll be able to make crisper pitches, with better command.

123
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,510
I see, staying back
on the back foot.

124
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,230
Timeout.

125
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,650
What's going on ?

126
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,050
The day will be over soon if they
keep taking timeouts like this !

127
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,200
Sorry for the wait.

128
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,990
Okay.

129
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,200
Play.

130
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,340
Strike !

131
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,130
He should stop moving his head, too.

132
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,310
It takes his eyes 
off the catcher's mitt.

133
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,600
Yeah, that's right.

134
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:46,680
Timeout.

135
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,700
Hey, hey, hey, hey !

136
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,760
Sorry for the wait.

137
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,490
Play.

138
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,810
Strike two !

139
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,040
How was that ?

140
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,660
Now, he needs to use his arm
better and stay back at the waist.

141
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,270
Using his arm better and staying back at the waist.

142
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,540
Um...

143
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,280
Hm ?

144
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,700
If you say all those things
at once, he'll get confused.

145
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,980
Okay ?

146
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,070
Oh, yeah.

147
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,550
That's right.

148
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,100
Strike ! Batter out !

149
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,450
What were you doing ?
All you did was just stand there.

150
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,270
Well, we don't have
to be so greedy, Kine.

151
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,930
He's good enough
to catch your pitches.

152
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,500
Right, Kunimi ?

153
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,580
Thanks.

154
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,600
You can catch it, right fielder !

155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,910
Ah, center fielder !

156
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,410
Nice job, center fielder !

157
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,660
Keep up the good work !

158
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,050
Let's stay focused !

159
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,590
Nice job !

160
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,470
Call me Hikari.

161
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,490
EYECATCH

162
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,820
Strike !

163
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,550
Strike two !

164
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,610
Strike ! Batter out !

165
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,550
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,460
Don't worry.

167
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,440
Don't worry !

168
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,360
Let's give it our best !

169
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,010
Don't worry, huh ?

170
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah.

171
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,530
Hikari.

172
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,340
Call me Hikari.

173
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,420
Kine, play with them a little bit.

174
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,200
There !

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,690
Yes !

176
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,700
Here's a pass !

177
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,700
All right !

178
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,100
Shoot !

179
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,650
Okay.

180
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,460
Congratulations on your double.

181
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,030
Don't worry.

182
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,550
Won, tan, men !

183
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,770
That's unfortunate. 
Right at the third baseman.

184
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,760
Oh, I dropped it.

185
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Out !

186
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,340
Okay.

187
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,340
Nice work.

188
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,240
Salt, ra, men !

189
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,490
That's pathetic.

190
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,360
It was right down the middle.
He should've hit it over the outfielder.

191
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,550
The second base runner has rounded third base.

192
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,720
Throw home.

193
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,090
All right.

194
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,640
Safe !

195
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,170
What're you doing ?

196
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,880
You should have caught it.

197
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,250
Weren't you playing around ?

198
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,020
You didn't have to give
them a run, moron.

199
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,800
Oh, well.

200
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,920
The runner is on the move.

201
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Out.

202
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,130
Two outs. Two outs.

203
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,400
That's not too bad.

204
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,660
What ?

205
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:28,310
But the transfer needs to be smoother, otherwise he can't get fast runners out.

206
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,860
Who are you ?

207
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,390
I'm just a swimming club member
who just happened to be passing by.

208
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,400
Hit !

209
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,200
Honestly, even if you go to 
baseball clubs around here...

210
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,330
...you won't find as 
good a pitcher as him.

211
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,200
Oh...

212
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,610
Who in the world is he ?

213
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,560
Strike ! Batter out !

214
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,410
Tane !

215
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,410
That's not it.

216
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,990
Maybe it's Yone.

217
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,350
That sounds like an old woman's name.

218
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,300
That's right.

219
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,140
He was a smart pitcher with a great tactical mind, especially for a grade-schooler.



220
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,850
His crisp curveball was particularly remarkable.

221
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,600
Does he still play baseball ?

222
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,410
I don't know.

223
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,200
Come to think of it, I haven't 
heard anything about him since.

224
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:27,120
With that kind of talent, he 
should be on a prestigious team.

225
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,150
It's just that...

226
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,500
It's just that ?

227
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,560
He was a jerk.

228
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,200
Hey, Koga.

229
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,430
You'll just feel miserable if you keep cheering for those pathetic guys.

230
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,800
There's nothing more meaningless than effort made by people without talent.

231
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,640
You should run seriously.

232
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,500
If I ran seriously, it would be an easy inside-the-park homerun.

233
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,290
There.

234
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,100
In that backyard, you can't even practice relay throws, can you ?

235
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,390
You're an eyesore. Why don't
you just disband already, Senior ?

236
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,530
Um...

237
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,120
Batting fourth, third baseman, Akagi.

238
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,680
Out !

239
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,200
What a moron.

240
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,290
Nice job ! Nice catch !
What a moron.

241
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,650
Nice job ! Nice catch !

242
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,650
Let's keep it up !

243
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,000
I got it. I got it.

244
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,110
Out !

245
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,610
Damn.

246
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,050
Moron.

247
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,510
What are you doing hitting
a silly ball from a 3-0 count ?

248
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,810
Really ? If it were you, 
you'd work a walk ?

249
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,040
No way.

250
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,550
See ?

251
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,340
It's okay because
we're just fooling around.

252
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,910
Get Hideo to the plate !
Get on base no matter what !

253
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,420
We're going to turn the
score around ! Got that ?

254
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,330
Yeah !

255
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,550
Batter out !

256
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,910
Yeah ! 
We kept them scoreless !

257
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,330
You did it !

258
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,200
Keep it up ! Keep it up !

259
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
Nice work ! Nice work !

260
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,660
Let's go home, Hiro.

261
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,670
50 more pitches.

262
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,110
If you don't stop, you're going to become a baseball idiot.

263
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,670
Baseball idiot...

264
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,250
Platypus. Salt.

265
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,650
Women's bath.

266
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,450
Bow and arrow.

267
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,470
Arrow...

268
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,010
All right, let's go ! Nice work !

269
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,920
They're such morons.

270
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,820
B...

271
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,550
B...

272
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,630
Baseball...

273
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,350


274
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,540
Hiro, are you going to
quit the soccer club ?

275
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,930
I'm getting tired of going
along with this bullshit game.

276
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,270
So you are going to...

277
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,010
Of course. I'll join the baseball fan club, along with Noda.

278
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,350
Noda will resume baseball, too ?

279
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,430
He comes in to pinch-hit in a bases-loaded opportunity.

280
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,800
He must have intended to
make a timely appearance.

281
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,740
Next episode of H2, 
"Do You Require a Registration Form ?"

282
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,170
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

283
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,090
episode of H2 is Do You Require a Registration Form ? Look forward to it !}
