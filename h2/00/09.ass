What he says is "It's a piece of cake for me to play concurrently on two clubs, and my child is a four year-old." The "my child..." part is the homophone joke.\N\NAnother phonic joke that is totally banal. To "stop" is "yosu / yose / yoshite," and there's a common Japanese female name, "yoshiko," so Kine combines the two sounds.\N\N And another phonic joke. "Think about it" is "kangaete oke" and Kine turns the "oke / oki" part into "Okinawa."
