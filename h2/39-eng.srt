1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,800
Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,000
Give It Your Best, Meiwa Ichi !

17
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,000
In the finals of the Fall Tournament...

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,620
...Hideo's Meiwa battled against Eikyou High School and its ace pitcher, Hirota.

19
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,200
The pitch thrown by Eikyou's Hirota...

20
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,680
...fractured Hideo's arm.

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,100
And winter, which is harsh on
 those who are injured, has come.

22
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,350


23
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,400
The First Date !

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,400
 Episode 39

25
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,400
The Cast in Your Heart Isn't Gone Yet

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,800
Let's go !

27
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,540
There you go !

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,050
Yeah !

29
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,200
Good job !

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,370
Third !

31
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,060
Okay !

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,290
One more !

33
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,140
Let's go !

34
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,260
Tachibana.

35
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,880
Yes ?

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,260
Looks like you're out of the cast.

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,710
Yes, yesterday.

38
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,970
Don't push yourself too hard. 
We're fine as long as you recover by spring.

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know if we can wait that long.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,400
There are things to do, like doing
infield drills and practicing sign plays.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,600
A first year doesn't need to worry about those things.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,200
I want to win at the Koushien.

43
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,250
It's not official yet that we're going.

44
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,260
Besides, this spring won't be your 
only chance, since you're a first year.

45
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,260
You're a first-year, after all.

46
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,560
Dammit !

47
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,540
You're working hard.

48
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,790
You were watching me ?

49
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,400
I don't have my
 arm strength back yet.

50
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,610
You shouldn't push yourself.

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,390
I need to get recover and join
 my teammates as soon as I can.

52
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,000
To be able to win without practicing team plays...

53
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,410
The Koushien isn't such a cakewalk.

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,650
So I do need to 
push myself hard.

55
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,780
You can go ahead and go home.

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,500
Hide-chan...

57
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,120
That was fast !

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
How was it ?

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,730
There's no way anyone can hit that. It was a great pitch.

60
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,300
A liner directly hitting
 the right field wall.

61
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,510
That's what Hirota hit off
 of Hiro's max-effort pitch.

62
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay, I'm done.

63
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,450
It's too cold.
 My arm can't get warmed up.

64
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,740
Kunimi Hiro's homework 
is to add more power.

65
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,380
A coach must be able to 
withstand the cold weather.

66
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,570
Shut up.

67
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,990
It's true that we can't advance
 unless we beat Hirota's Eikyou.

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,150
Thank you !

69
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,950
But I think you're too hung up on giving up that hit.

70
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,080
It's not just about defeating that guy.

71
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
What is it, then ?

72
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,800
It's my own problem.

73
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,500
It's a hurdle I have to overcome in order to go to the Koushien.

74
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,490
I guess.

75
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,380
There will be better
 hitters at the Koushien.

76
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,570
Yeah. There's the son 
of the liquor store, too.

77
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,560
Huh ?

78
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,700
See you tomorrow.

79
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,530
Yeah.

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,850
What's the matter ?

81
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,000
It's just a small thing.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,650
See ? You understand 
how he feels, right ?

83
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,930
Yeah. I get it.

84
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,150
He wants to look cool,
 especially in front of you.

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,150
He doesn't want to show you that he's struggling.

86
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,000
What should I do, then ?

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,910
You should leave him alone. You know better than anyone how stubborn he is.

88
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,400
But as the girlfriend of
 such a stubborn guy...

89
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,400
...I feel that I should prevent him from re-injuring himself through overwork.

90
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,310
"You should cure your elbow pain with your will power !"

91
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,910
You were so hard on me.

92
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,850
Hide-chan will actually try
 to cure it with his will power.

93
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,480
And he's my boyfriend.

94
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,060
Now, go !

95
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,200
I guess you two can't do it.

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,610
You two are kind of reserved
toward each other sometimes.

97
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,400
"Good manners even between friends."

98
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,520
Lame !

99
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm powering up ! There !

100
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,510
Lame !

101
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,100
What ?!

102
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,970


103
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,590


104
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,710
Showing your underwear 
is an unfair attack !

105
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,350
You saw them ?
I won't forgive you !

106
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,010
You should be firm with Hideo, too.

107
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,060
Be firm.

108
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,450
Kunimi !

109
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,760
Hey, Manager !

110
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,590
How's Tachibana doing ?

111
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,160
He's had his cast removed.

112
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,810
But it's amazing. He hit a
 homerun, even with a fractured arm.

113
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,700
Yes.

114
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,180
Are you walking the dog ?

115
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,210
I'm on my way 
to do some shopping.

116
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,040
Come to think of it, you run a bookstore, right, Hikari ?

117
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,210
Yeah.

118
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,390
That's convenient.

119
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,270
Hm ?

120
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,300
Hey, stop that, Third.

121
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,060
Koga, this is what I recommend.

122
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,540
That doesn't work. I need one that's more hardcore.

123
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,900
What ? Something more hardcore ?

124
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,240
That's tough. Let's see...

125
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,450
People under the age of 18 can't buy age-restricted materials, you know ?

126
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,330
The hardcore ones are wrapped in 
plastic and I can't see the contents.

127
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,270
I'd like to get these five books.

128
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,990
New Power-Up

129
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,580
What did you buy ?

130
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,900
It's a secret.

131
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,520
Let's go home, Third.

132
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,840
Bye.

133
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,950
Thank you for your business.

134
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,760
Yeah. See you later.

135
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,600
Hey, what did you buy ?

136
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,860
Let me see them.

137
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,910
No, I won't let you.

138
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,890
Why not ?

139
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,980
I guess Hiro is busy, too.

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,120
Be firm and tell him. Be firm.

141
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,660
Wonderful.

142
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,700
Don't think with your head. Learn it with your body.

143
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,300
Where's that from ?

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,210
It's the words of Mr. Bruce Lee, whom your brother admires.

145
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,100
Oh.

146
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:32,030
Sweet potatoes baked in hot stones !

147
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,710
Do you want one ?

148
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,030
No.

149
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,320
Oh, yes.
 I pilfered these from Father.

150
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,790
Special complimentary tickets for a sports gym. One month free.

151
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,430
This isn't good.

152
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,330
The glitter in your eyes is one of someone who wants to help our ace pitcher bulk up.

153
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,350
That's bad.

154
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,560
Why ? You said that he needs to build some strength, too.

155
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,500
That's bad.

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,650
Even if he's our ace pitcher,
 all players must be treated equally.

157
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,800
We can't give him special treatment.

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,000
You're talking like a coach.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,530
I am a coach.

160
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,930
But...

161
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,500
If you're going to give them to him as a friend, that's outside of my domain.

162
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,570
Huh ?

163
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,830
Well, anyway, I don't need them myself. I guess I'll leave them here.

164
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,780
Sorry for the intrusion.

165
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,700
Hikari !

166
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,650
Good evening.

167
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,500
How long have you been there ?

168
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,000
Just now.

169
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,630
You should have said something. You surprised me.

170
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,440
Your arm.

171
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,700
You're such a worrier.

172
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,500
It's fine. See ?

173
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,600
There's no way he's fine.

174
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,500
But I don't think you 
should push yourself.

175
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,090
I can't sit still. 
Give me the bat.

176
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,060
Don't give it to him, Hikari. 
You should be firm and tell him.

177
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,500
Here.

178
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,200
Why did she give it to him ?!

179
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,650
Was it the wind ?

180
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,400
Hide-chan.

181
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,460
Oh, am I in the way ?

182
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not that, but it must be cold. It's getting windy, too.

183
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,100
There he goes again,
 trying to look cool.

184
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,440
Hide-chan, don't overwork yourself.

185
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,400
Geez.

186
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,040
Bye.

187
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,760
Take care.

188
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,750
Thanks.

189
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,730
Oh, man.
 Do I have to intervene ?

190
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,820
No, I don't.

191
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,200
Right ?

192
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,880


193
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,100
Aim for the Koushien

194
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,630


195
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,800
Aim for the Koushien

196
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,360
Good morning, Kunimi !

197
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,820
Hey, Manager !

198
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,090
Kunimi.

199
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,960
What's the matter ?

200
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,360
I have a favor to ask.

201
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,970
Think of this as a date. 
Can you come with me ?

202
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,650
As I told you, I'll go with you as long as we're splitting the tab.

203
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,560
Oh, don't worry about the cost.

204
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,340
This gym is part of my father's company, so we can use it for free.

205
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,200
Kunimi Taro of the Third Section of the Sales Department....

206
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,570
...has never received such a great offer.

207
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,740
It's no good ?

208
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,150
If he gets promoted to executive rank, like tomorrow, there's no issue.

209
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,170
Should I ask my father ?

210
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,280
No way.

211
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,530
I was just kidding.

212
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,200
Anyway, it's good to 
build strength at a gym...

213
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,600
...but I'm not suited for 
working out with machines.

214
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,000
I love to run with the wind like this, and feel the smell of the land.

215
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,650
If I were a professional ballplayer...

216
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,990
...I'd be in the envious position of being able to work out in a warm, southern country.

217
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,430
Okay. We'll go with
 however you want to do it.

218
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:21,000
I did study a lot about what kinds of 
muscles are needed for a power pitcher.

219
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,300
It would be ideal to give
yourself all-around training...

220
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,570
...but I reached a conclusion that this would be the best option.

221
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,250
The dorsal muscles are hard to train through routine workout, after all.

222
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm impressed.

223
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,490
What ?

224
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,520
You're impressive.

225
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,040
Um...

226
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,260
Third ! Good boy ! 
Here you go !

227
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Senkawa High School

228
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,470
There !

229
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,610
Here you go !

230
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,330
Oh, I'm sorry !

231
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
There !

232
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,000
This red-bean jam bun is tasty.

233
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,730
Are you done eating ?

234
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,970
I might be a lucky guy.

235
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,180
What are you talking about ?

236
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,430
If I think that way, it gives me some peace of mind.

237
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,690
Oh, so you're not eating.

238
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,500
It broadens your mind, and you start to see things you didn't before.

239
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,850
It's a little weird between Hikari and Hideo.

240
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,430
Those two ?

241
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,510
When I see them, it frustrates me.

242
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,310
They've always been
 like that, haven't they ?

243
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,140
They got together because you played go-between.

244
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,360
I see.

245
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,500
But I'd say they should be able to manage by themselves now.

246
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,200
Yeah.

247
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
You're not eating this ?

248
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
It can't be helped.

249
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,030
This will be the last time.

250
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,060
What ?

251
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,090
What did you do here ?

252
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,960
You said you weren't going to eat.

253
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,120
I didn't say that !

254
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,550
Give me back my bun !

255
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,790
Didn't you say you've become peaceful ?

256
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,050
Here.

257
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,250
Are you sure it's okay ?

258
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,900
Yes. Please let them use those.

259
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,880
Thanks. See you !

260
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,230
You did it ?

261
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,740
Hm ?

262
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,950
You gave them to him ?

263
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,610
Yup.

264
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,610
Marvelous.

265
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,150
Hey, Hiro. 
I didn't know you were here.

266
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,120
What are you doing ? 
You surprised me.

267
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,150
The fact that you're favoring the left arm means you're still far from recovered.

268
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,060
I only recently got the cast off.
 It goes without saying.

269
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,050
Come with me.

270
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,600
Hm ?

271
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,000
Open

272
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,340
A complimentary ticket for the gym ?

273
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,720
Yeah.

274
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,380
That's nice of you.
You really are my best friend.

275
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,250
Hey.

276
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,000
I have one more ticket here.

277
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,300
Then why don't we go together ?
You should work out some, too.

278
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,250
Moron.

279
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,000
Huh ?

280
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,730
Idiot.

281
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,770
What's that about ?

282
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,210
You don't seem to understand why I brought you here.

283
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,100
Welcome.

284
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,490
Hi.

285
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,380
Hiro, what is it that you
 wanted to talk about ?

286
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,240
Hm ?

287
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,260
Hide-chan...

288
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,650
Anyway, I'll give these 
tickets to you and Hikari.

289
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,000
You should go there together.

290
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,850
Why ?

291
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,260
You probably think that the behind-the-scenes effort needs to be kept to yourself.

292
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,090
Huh ?

293
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,680
You probably think that you want to 
continue to look cool in front of Hikari.

294
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,430
Hey !

295
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,500
Don't read my mind.

296
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,950
Honestly, you haven't 
changed since junior high.

297
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,700
Hmm...!

298
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,980
You'd try acting cool in front of Hikari.

299
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,780
Whether you were nervous 
or whatever, you'd never talk.

300
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,300
I always had to play the clown.

301
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,120
But that should be over, 
don't you think ?

302
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,740
Anyway, you should know that
 this is the last time I'll intervene.

303
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,290
Hiro ?

304
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,650
You shouldn't talk to me. The rest should be decided by you two.

305
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,330
Thank you for coming.

306
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,000
What the heck am I doing ?

307
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,900
The cast on your arm may be gone, 
but the cast in your heart isn't gone yet.

308
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,210
You shouldn't stay so stiff anymore.

309
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,500
By this time, you two should be
 beyond acting cool in front of each other.

310
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,630
The draft through the space
between you two is way too cold.

311
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,580
What is Hiro talking about, really ?

312
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,730
He's the one who's
 trying to act cool.

313
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,690
That's right.

314
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,440
Anyway, you should know that
 this is the last time I'll intervene.

315
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,330
He's such a meddler.

316
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,240
There's no draft through 
the space between us.

317
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,850
Right ?

318
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,440
But if it looked that way to him...

319
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,730
Would you come with me ?

320
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,000
I love you, Hide-chan.

321
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,950
Oh...

322
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,690
There !

323
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,400
I see. Hikari and him are going.

324
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,360
Yeah.

325
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,200
I have to think of some other way to build your strength.

326
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,490
I'll work hard on that.

327
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,640
Your smile gives 
me enough strength.

328
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,400
Eh ?

329
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,700
If we're late,

That's right. Good. Slowly.

Hikari.

334
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,990
If it were Hiro...

335
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,300
If it were Hiro...?

336
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,450
You'd be harder on him, right ?

337
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,100
Be firm and tell him. Be firm !

338
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,410
Firm !

339
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,450
Huh ?

340
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,270
You really are different from Hiro.

00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:00,630
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

359
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,930
"I'm definitely glad we met."

Let's stay strong and move forward.

361

When I'm by myself I notice...

362
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,430
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

363
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,230
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

364
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,480
...there are more and more smiles.

365
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,930
Just by looking at you, see ?

366
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,030
My eyes will look kinder.

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,790
Memories ? What are they ?

370
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,730
I'll give you a hint. 
Elm. Essay. Baseball.

371
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,360
I don't get it at all.

372
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,550
Geez. I guess I'll give you
one more hint, just for you.

373
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,070
The schoolyard of
 the elementary school.

374
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,210
Anyway, I guess I'll
 have to go and see it.

375
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,540
That's right. I hope you'll remember the dream you had back then.
