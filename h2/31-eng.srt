Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,440
Hideo and I frantically looked for Hikari.

17
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,760
We were seriously worried about the possibility of her being assaulted.

18
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,750
But all that came out of it was an uneasy feeling.

19

Win! Meiwa Nine

26
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,570
Victory for Meiwa!

27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,800
Meiwa

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Good Luck!

Nakai

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,630
This is really great.

36
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,450
Yeah. It's heating up.

37
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,000
Certain Victory! Eikyou High School

38
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,000
Good Luck

39
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,810
Give It Your Best, Eikyou Nine

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,720
Fight ! Fight !

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,520
Tachibana, this is an easy win !

42
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,400
Who do you think is going to win ?

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Hmm...

44
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:56,860


45
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,900
Wow... 

46
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
Boom, boom, boom.

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,900
Pop, pop.

48
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,800
Wow...

49
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,450
What are you doing over there ?
 The final game has started !

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,960
The ballpark is just next door. 
Get a move on ! Run ! Run !

51
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right. I guess we 
came here to watch baseball.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,910
Of course.

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll go on ahead.

54
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,140
She could have given us a ride.

55
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,650
Meiwa Ichi

56
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,650
Eikyou

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,530
After the top of the 2nd, the score is 0-0.


58
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,650
But once you've come this far, you'd 
probably be able to go to the Invitational.

59
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,900
Yeah. Two schools are 
selected from Tokyo every year.

60
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,300
But I'm happy for you.

61
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,120
About what ?

62
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,970
That you two don't have to play
 against each other in the preliminary.

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,120
The what ?

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,630
That's right ! Perhaps we'll face off against Meiwa in the Koushien next summer !

65
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,790
What ?

66
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,700
Huh ?

67
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,950
I mean, we're located right on the boundary between the north and south parts of Tokyo.

68
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,080
Meiwa would be from southern Tokyo. 
And Senkawa would be from northern Tokyo.

69
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,760
Oh, you didn't know ?

70
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,160
It's a double.

71
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,450
Sorry about that.

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,120
Oh, I'm fine.

73
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,100
That's such a nice spectacle, just as it should be in high school baseball.

74
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,300
Hmm...

75
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,740
He's Hirota Katsutoshi
of Eikyou High School.

76
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,360
He's a first year who got tapped as the ace pitcher, hitting cleanup, out of nowhere.

77
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,200
A first year who's in the starting lineup. He's just like Tachibana.

78
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,300
Yeah.

79
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,620
North Tokyo.

80
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,690
Yes, Eikyou High School is.

81
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,780
Meiwa is from the south,
 and Senkawa is from the north.

82
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,700
We won't face Meiwa.

83
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,160
I wonder if we should be happy...

84
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,700
Or disappointed.

85
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,110
It's kind of a let down.

86
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,950
Meiwa Ichi

87
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,950
Eikyou

88
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,800
Meiwa Ichi

89
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,800
Eikyou

90
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,260
Out.

91
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,200
He paints the corners.

92
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,200
Yes, he does.

93
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,650
I got it. I got it.

94
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,060
A pitch-to-contact guy ?

95
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,650
If you can pitch-to-contact and hold down the Meiwa lineup, that's impressive.

96
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,200
Murabe

97
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,200
Tachibana

98
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,200
Nakai

99
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,050
What happened in
 Hideo's first at-bat ?

100
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,850
No idea.

101
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,600
He struck out swinging.

102
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,450
Well, that happens sometimes.

103
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,300
Moreover...

104
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,810
...it wasn't just a strikeout.

105
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,540
Strike !

106
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,810
I guess it wasn't just a rumor.

107
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,300
Huh ?

108
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,800
He touches the cap once and
 then raises his arm. That's his sign.

109
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,300
He's predicting a strikeout.

110
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,200
A predicted strikeout ?

111
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,300
Yeah.

112
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,510
He can pull a stunt like that ?

113
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,300
Of course he denies it.

114
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,170
He says it's just coincidental.

115
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Senior.

116
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,500
Huh ?

117
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,150
That's my spot.

118
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,250
Oh, sorry about that.

119
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,260
You should be more attentive.

120
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,810
But...

121
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:54,100
If this "coincidence" occurs in every game, the cheer squad will expect it regardless.

122
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,550
Hold it !

123
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,100
So you're saying that Hideo struck 
out when it was predicted like that ?

124
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,260
Well, who knows ?

125
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,570
Okay, let's play-to-contact !

126
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,510
EYECATCH

127
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,550
Meiwa Ichi

128
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,550
Eikyou

129
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,000
Hikari, I'm going to get some juice.
You want some ?

130
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,970
If you're buying me one, yes.

131
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,300
Your lack of reservation is so refreshing.

132
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,370
I'll get going.

133
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,720
Hey.

134
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,000
Hey, exam student. What are
 you doing in a place like this ?

135
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,290
I'm taking a study break.

136
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,290
Out.

137
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,900
The Invitational appearance is all but decided. He's finally going to be a national star.

138
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,210
And eventually, he's going to be a professional baseball player who earns a huge salary.

139
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,330
I'm counting on you, Hide-chan.

140
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,580
Take care of me,
 in place of my dead brother.

141
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,100
You don't have to bring up 
your dead brother all the time.

142
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,600
Hide-chan isn't going to 
abandon you regardless.

143
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,480
I suppose.

144
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,650
But the truth may be that he thinks of me as an unwelcome reminder.

145
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,650
He had almost forgotten
 about it all by now, after all.

146
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,600
It's your brother who taught Hide-chan baseball, right ?

147
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,550
Then the fact that he hasn't given up baseball is evidence that he hasn't forgotten.

148
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,690
...is evidence that he hasn't forgotten

149
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,900
You should rest assured.

150
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,000
No matter how famous he becomes, Hide-chan will always be what he is.

151
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,400
Your childhood friend.

152
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,700
You're really preachy today.

153
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,300
Once I learned that you were younger than us...

154
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,000
...your way of acting bad started to seem kind of adorable.

155
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,260
Um, Hikari...

156
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,240
Thanks.

157
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,700
Now, go. 
This is my friend's seat.

158
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,950
Oh, Shuu.

159
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,390
Did you give it up ?

160
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,670
Give up what ?

161
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,800
Hide-chan wasn't the only one your
 brother taught baseball to, was he ?

162
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,740
Out !

163
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,140
Hirota.

164
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,020
We don't need a perfect 
game or a no-hitter.

165
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,080
I know, Coach. 
We first need to win.

166
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,920
Senior, you're going at it halfheartedly.

167
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,850
If you're going to do it,
 you have to go all the way.

168
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,060
If it's an accident, you won't be
 blamed for it, no matter what it is.

169
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,730
Fight ! Fight ! Meiwa ! 
Fight ! Fight ! Meiwa !

170
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,200
I guess it's his turn.

171
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,000
This is the second at-bat for the liquor store's son.

172
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,400
Strike !

173
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,590
That punk...

174
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,870
Strike ! Batter out !

175
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,990
It was close.

176
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
That was the fifth 
predicted strikeout.

177
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,170
Tokyo really is a big world. 
What a phenomenal pitcher.

178
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,800
Eikyou High School, Hirota Katsutoshi.

179
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Starting next year, they'll be one 
of the perennials at the Koushien.

180
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,400
In north Tokyo, there's Senkawa.

181
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,250
Kunimi Hiro.

182
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,910
Both are certainly phenomenal pitchers.

183
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,100
But in terms of their team as a whole, the difference is apparent.

184
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,020
The depth of the roster. 
Excellent training facilities.

185
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,930
And above all, the total respect that the coach commands.

186
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,280
Coach Shiroyama.

187
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,280
He's a famous coach who's won one spring and two summer Koushien championships.



188
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,000
He's coached for a long
 time, in many places.

189
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,400
Once you reach his age, you'll be called a famous coach, too.

190
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,540
Ball.

191
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,450
This is the first time that
 there's been a full count.

192
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,370
Yeah. He's not wild.

193
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,100
Safe.

194
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,950
Senior, your start is slow.

195
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,050
You should value 
your starting lineup spot.

196
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,250
There's a good first year reserve third baseman.

197
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,550
Murabe

198
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,550
Tachibana

199
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,550
Nakai

200
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,120
Batting fourth, third baseman, Tachibana.

201
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,250
Go get them, Tachibana !

202
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,980
Fight, Hide-chan !

203
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,700
He's amazingly popular.

204
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,420
Ball.

205
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,790
...?

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,950
Ball.

207
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,650
His motion...

208
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,650
Can it be...?

209
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,500
Strike !

210
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,950
Strike two !

211
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,300
Was it such an unhittable pitch ?

212
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,950
No.

213
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,470
I think he's returning the favor.

214
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
If you can declare it, go right ahead.

215
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,910
Hey, you...

216
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,450
That was a little different.

217
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,600
Serves him right.

218
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,130
I guess he's not a 
run-of-the-mill luck-pusher.

219
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,800
Hideo, crush his pride !

220
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,050
Hide-chan...

221
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,020


222
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,750

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:57,330
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

242
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,630
"I'm definitely glad we met."

243
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,450
Let's stay strong and move forward.

244
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,180
When I'm by myself I notice...

245
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,130
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

246
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,930
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

247
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,180
...there are more and more smiles.

248
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,630
Just by looking at you, see ?

249
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,730
My eyes will look kinder.

Next Episode

251
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,570
Hit by a pitch. Hide-chan is down.

252
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,130
He's fine. He'll get up 
like nothing happened.

253
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,660
That's right. 
Hide-chan is a talented hitter.

254
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,810
Yeah, he's a big guy.

255
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,120
He's going to show us how big he is.

256
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,060
But really, I can't like how Eikyou plays baseball.

257
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,120
Is it possible that 
they hit him on purpose ?

258

An At-Bat Full of Spirit

262
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,500
Look forward to it !

263
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,390
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
