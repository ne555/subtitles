Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,750
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,750
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,850
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,900
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,400
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,870
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,500
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,700
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:52,300
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,200
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,750
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,060
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,550
...to this big, endless dream.

17
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,870
Hikari and I had a sleepless night.

18
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,600
Well, I was actually snoring and sleeping.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,690
The next day, the sky was bright, as though nothing had happened.

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,010
Nothing really happened, but 
I couldn't tell Hideo about this.

21
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,020
That's right. I couldn't tell Hideo.

22
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,500
I Can't Sleep...

23
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,050

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,440
Thank you.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,100

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,660
We're blessed with great weather here at Koushien Stadium.

30
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,300
As you can see,
 the stadium is packed.

31
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,300
This is the final game
of the summer tournament.

32
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,760
The commentator, as you know, is Mr. Nehori Ichitarou.

33
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,830
Wow.

34
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,700
Pleased to meet you.

35
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,000
Top of the first, 
Saeki Chuuou is up to bat.

36
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,700
Well, this sure is
a Japanese summer.

37
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,410
Now, the pitcher, Yamashita,
prepares to throw his first pitch !

38
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,450
He throws !

39
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,890
Strike !

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,560
The second pitch.

41
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,330
It's hit !

42
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,030
The third baseman deftly handles a hard-hit ball.

43
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,500
As expected, the teams in the finals sure are good.

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,330
I can't sleep, Hide-chan.

46
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,510
Bottom of the first, Youkou High School has an early scoring opportunity.

47
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,680
Runners on second and third with one out, the batter is the cleanup hitter, Yoshida.

48
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
All right, Tachibana ! One more !

49
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,610
Please !

50
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,840
Okay, one more !

51
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,790
Please !

52
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,540
Bottom of the sixth, 
Youkou's inning continues.

53
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,750
It's a hit ! They scored their ninth run !

54
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,600
Moron ! That's not right !

55
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,550
Saeki Chuuou

56
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,550
Youkou

57
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,100
Well, it's the sixth inning, and the game has turned into an unexpectedly lopsided one.

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,700
This is this year's final game of the 
National High School Baseball Tournament.

59
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,600
Saeki Chuuou is making its first appearance at the Koushien...

60
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,650
...and it has miraculously advanced this far with one come-from-behind win after another.

61
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,200
But they've been forced onto the
 defensive against Youkou High School...

62
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,250
...widely thought of as the favorite to win the championship.

63
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,300
It's gone over the outfielders !

64
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,750
It's their tenth run !

65
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, an error ! The third base runner charges home plate !

66
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,250
Safe !

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,380
What the heck are they doing ?

68
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,100
Why do they throw when
 it wouldn't make it in time ?

69
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,800
What is their manager thinking ?
 Pull yourselves together !

70
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,600
Um, it's troubling other customers.
Could you please keep it down ?

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,350
I got a little carried away.

73
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,200
Sorry about that.

74
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh...

75
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,250
Can I have another cup of coffee ?

76
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,250
This is your seventh...

77
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,080
It's 11-0, a commanding lead.

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,350
I hope they'll hang in there and finish out the game.

79
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,880
That's right.

80
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,050
That's right.

81
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,250
In terms of lopsided
games at the Koushien...

82
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,310
...the game that comes to
mind is from ten years ago.

83
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,650
Yes, there was one.

84
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,550
That game by Sousei High School.

85
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,180
The 0-30, no-hitter loss.

86
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,250
Man, again ?

87
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,110
If you mention that, Yanagi's
father, meaning our principal...

88
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,460
...will get irritated.

89
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,220
After all, the Koushien doesn't
 do called games. It was rough.

90
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,050
Yes, exactly.

91
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,200
When there's that much
of a gap between teams...

92
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,640
...I wish we could have
called off that game.

93
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,670
You shouldn't say stuff like that, idiot !

94
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,650
You should have seen how they'd compete in terms of their achievement test scores !

95
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,010
The school that gets "no-hit shutout" would be their opponent !

96
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,900
That year, Sousei Baseball Club was the best team in the nation, in terms of academics !

97
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,600
For three years, those guys
 never lowered their grades...

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,720
...and worked hard on both academics and baseball !

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,200
If it's a school baseball competition...

100
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,060
...you should judge them based on both academics and sports !

101
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,170
Oh...

102
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,700
Sir...

103
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,060
Can I have another cup of coffee ?

104
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,000
Sure...

105
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,880
Oh, the runner is taking a big lead.

106
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,210
A throw from the 
catcher to second base.

107
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,610
It's an out !

108
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,800
How stupid !

109
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
What are they doing ? 
That's not how you do it !

110
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,250
Let me manage the team !

111
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,200
Aim for the Koushien

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,050
The game is over. 16-0.

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,130
Youkou High School wins the 
summer Koushien tournament !

116
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,250
Well...

117
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,720
Well...

118
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,400
Well, well...

Ah.

121
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,450
Hi.

122
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,600
What are you doing ?

123
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,000
I came here to clean the room. What about you, Hiro ?

124
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,400
Um, well, I just came by to get the undershirts that I forgot.

125
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,830
Um...

126
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,800
Oh, crap.

127
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,150
Here.

128
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,600
Oh, you have those kinds of books ?

129
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,080
It's your study guide, right ?

130
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,980
Moron !

131
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,650
Oh, Hiro.

132
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,230
Hide-chan is coming back from his training camp tomorrow.

133
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,200
I see. 
It's tomorrow for us, too.

134
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,350
What ?

135
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,350
Senkawa High School

138
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,640
The construction work for the baseball field starts.

139
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,060
Oh.

140
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,410
Bye.

141
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,150
If I find any more of your "study guides" 
as I clean the room, I'll save those for you.

142
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:57,960


143
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,370
What ?!

147
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,120
Well, well, well...

148
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,700
"Back up," "hot blood."
"Come out, Heroes."

149
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,510
Hm.

150
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,700
Come Out

151
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,700
Heroes

152
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,350
Aim for Koushien
Kunimi Hiro

153
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,970
It's not over yet.
One hundred more pitches...

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
Here I go, Noda !

155
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,700
Okay.

156
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,250
Good job, Hiro. One more out.

157
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,490
Let's pull ourselves together...

158
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,790
Okay. Let's finish with
the 140 km forkball...

159
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,490
We did it, Noda !

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,720
What...

161
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,310
EYECATCH

162
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,760
Did anything happen while
 I was away at training camp ?

163
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,410
Um, not really.

164
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,000
How's Hiro doing ?

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,500
He's being his usual lazy self.

166
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,440
That sounds just like him.

167
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,650
He should follow your
example a little more.

168
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,980
I mean, Hiro is...

169
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,500
Oh, yeah.
The fireworks display is today.

170
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,000
It's that time of the year already.

171
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,950
Cool-Down Fireworks Display Festival

172
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,270
Welcome.

173
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,650
Ring Toss
1 Try - 200 yen

174
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,650
Here you go.

175
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,780
It's such a big crowd.

176
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,910
But anyway, where has Hiro gone ?

177
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,350
He should know about
the fireworks display.

178
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,220
Ever since he was a child, he was 
always excited about these festivals.

179
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,040
He's probably chasing 
some lady's tail right now.

180
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,460
Where in the world did he go ?

181
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,200
Huh ?

182
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
Where did Atsushi go ?

183
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
He's not here ?

184
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,540
No.

185
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,730
For goodness sakes, 
everyone's so self-centered.

186
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,120
Really.

187
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,180
Hey, Meiwa's cleanup batter.

188
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,110
Who are you ?

189
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,150
Moron ! It's me !

190
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,220
Oh, Fune.

191
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,540
It's Kine !

192
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,250
Ah, yeah, it's Kine.

193
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,880
Have you seen Koga ?

194
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,100
Huh ?

195
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,600
I haven't seen her today.

196
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,550
I see. I was supposed
 to meet her here.

197
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,290
More importantly, have you seen your team's battery ?

198
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,700
Why should I care about those guys ?!

199
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,480
Get out of my way !

200
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,110
Koga !

201
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,990
Koga is also missing...?

202
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,600
Where did that beauty go ?

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,300
Welcome !

204
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,110
Would you like some tasty yakisoba ?

205
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,060
Next customer, please !

206
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,150
A big serving, please.
 Give me some extra, okay ?

207
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,300
Sure.

208
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
What are you doing here ?

209
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,560
Well, I was just passing by.

210
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,100
Kunimi, thanks for the wait...

211
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,200
Oh.

212
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh.

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,530
Good evening, Noda.

214
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,640
Hi.

215
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,760
It looked dangerous, so...

216
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
For me.

217
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,430
My mother was supposed to do this,
but she had a sudden schedule conflict.

218
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,670
I was told to pinch-hit for her.

219
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,250
I see.

220
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,370
So Hiro is pinch-hitting
for the pinch-hitter ?

221
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,250
That's right.

222
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,050
I'm the dependable
savior in times of need.

223
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,690
One plate of yakisoba, please.

224
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,430
Sure.

225
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,210
Two here, please.

226
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,200
Sure, right away !

227
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,220
I guess I'll be the ball boy.

228
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,040
Oh.

229
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,910
Oh well.

230
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,620


231
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,900
Geez.

232
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,800
You should stay calm while you do it.

233
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,600
Eh ?

234
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,270
Yeah.

235
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,650
Mister, one more time !

236
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,420
Sure.

237
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,230
Okay, next customer !

238
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,310
Howdy, Miss.

239
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm Kunimi Tarou, of the third section of the sales department of Koga Trading Company.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,540
And his wife.

241
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,300
You two look like newlyweds. Are you on a date ?

242
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,900
Well, I saw you from over there.

243
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,190
I didn't know that our stupid son was here with you.

244
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,400
And he looks like
 a good match.

245
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,480
Shut up !

246
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,780
If you're not going to buy anything, just go away !

247
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:17,980


248
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,550
Hey.

249
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,710
You're fine, Miss.

250
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,350
Umm...

251
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,300
Kunimi Tarou of the third
section of the sales department...

252
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
...will protect you, even
 if it costs him his life.

253
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,200
Honey, hang in there ! 
Your promotion depends on it !

254
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,000
You want some of this ?

255
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,720


256
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Huh ?

257
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,960
Here's the pack you're waiting for.

258
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,590
Thanks.

259
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,310
I never thought you'd create a baseball club, Father.

260
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,270
Everyone's grateful to you.

261
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,640
Including me, of course.

262
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,830
Hello.

263
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,200
Well, this is where you can see the fireworks the best.

264
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,080
Everyone came over
here by coincidence.

265
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,200
Construction Site

266
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,200
Senkawa High School

267
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,200
Baseball Field

268
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,440
The backstop net is on that side ?

269
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,390
Yes.

270
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,550
You always stand under this tree.

271
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,510
What ?

272
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,000
When you watch fireworks, that is.

273
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,250
That's right.

274
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,660
I see. That's how you all
ended up cooking yakisoba.

275
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,250
Yeah.

276
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,470
And in exchange for my
 valuable work, we got this.

277
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:52,950
Wow.

278
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,120
Now, let's go to Hideo's place and
have a yakisoba party with free drinks.

279
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,660
One drink per person, okay ?

280
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,120
That means...

281
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,250
A can of juice, a can of coke,
a can of oolong tea, a can of coffee.

282
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,800
A total of four cans for me.

283
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,410
You only get one of those !

284
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,450
Then I'll take one big bottle.

285
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,150
What ?

286
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,670
Hideo, you've lost.

287
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,750
What a mess !

288
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,050
We'll take it like 
a free-and-easy party.

289
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,240
Phew.

290
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,150
Now, all the leftovers are taken care of.

291
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,250
You sure ate a lot.

292
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,450
It was better than I thought, Hiro.

293
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,720
Yeah.

294
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,990
See ?

295
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,700
You can become the prince
of the yakisoba world anytime.

296
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,700
Why, you...!

297
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Hey !

298
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,600
If I become one, I'm never going to hire you, even for part-time work.

299
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm not going to do anything other than professional baseball, so I don't care !

300
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,320
You jerk ! I'm going to
break your arm now !

301
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,060


302
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,390
You jerk !

303
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,110
Are you giving up ?

304
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,190
No way !

305
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,200
Don't back down, Hide-chan !
Go get him !

306
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,110


307
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
Somebody, cheer for me, too !

308
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,800
Go for it !

309
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Damn...

310
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,000
Ouch ! It hurts !

311
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,450
Lousy baseball player !

312
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,970
Shut up, Yakisoba Brat !

313
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:22,600
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

314
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,310
"Brat" ? Who are you 
to talk to me like that ?

315
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,800
Ouch ! Ouch !

316
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,960
There !

317
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,350


318
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,200
Oh, I'll clean this up.

319
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,540
I'll help, too.

320
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,740
Moron.

321
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,880
There.

322
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,100
Safe.

323
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,320
Nice backup.

324
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Thanks.

325
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,550
She's always like this. So she has all kinds of wounds all over her.

326
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,460
But I'm fine. I have a
band-aid with me today, too.

327
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,450
Oh.

328
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,990
What ? 
It's not good enough ?

329
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,600


330
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,210
Koga !

331
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,290
Hey, Koga !

332
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, it's the grand finale.

333
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, really ?

334

Hawaiin Shirt Guy in Restaurant: If you recall, Sousei High School is known to be an academically superior school. This guy is talking about how Sousei was so much more superior to the other school in terms of academics.

351
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,900

359
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,950
"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

360
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:00,650
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

361
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,830
"I'm definitely glad we met."

362
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Let's stay strong and move forward.

363
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,650
When I'm by myself I notice...

364
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

365
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,400
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

366
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,700
...there are more and more smiles.

367
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,900
Just by looking at you, see ?

368
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
My eyes will look kinder.

369
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,030
So they're constructing the field for
Senkawa High School's baseball club.

370
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,340
Yeah, it's different when
it becomes an actual club.

371
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,650
You seem motivated.

372
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,060
We have a club room, and we're getting some newcomers, too.

373
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,970
So you're seriously starting
to prepare for the Koushien now ?

374
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,250
Of course !

375
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,870
But...

376
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,330
Is something bothering you ?

377
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,720
Next episode of H2 is, 
"The Coach Has Arrived ! I'm Koga Fujio."

378
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,700
Next episode of H2 is

379
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,700
The Coach Has Arrived ! I'm Koga Fujio

380
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,700
Look forward to it !

381
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,760
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

382
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,430
