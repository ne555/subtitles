1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,800
Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,480
Her name is Amamiya Hikari.

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,240
She's my childhood friend.

18
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,220
When she's with me, she 
shows her strong-willed side...

19
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,000
...but in front of Hideo, whom she loves, she becomes an awfully attractive girl.

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,030
But that's not supposed to be all there is to her.

21
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,890


22
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,000

Baseball Club

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,470
Koga.

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,570
What is it ?

28
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,180
Practice ended early.

29
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,190
I guess.

30
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,260
You have time, right ?

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,800
Not really.

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,730
Let's go home together.
 I'll buy you a hot monja.

33
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm not hungry.

34
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,250
Do you want to go home together ?

35
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,700
Um, well, yes.

36
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,700
Let's go home together, then.

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,650
What ? What ?

38
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,450
You're going to treat 
me to some monja ?

39
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,300
What ?

40
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,700
I'm Koga, you know.

41
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,500
What ?!

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,220
Koga, which do you like better, takoyaki or imagawayaki ?

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,090
It's tasty !

44
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,700
If you're looking for cheap but good food, you should leave it to me, Noda Atsushi.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Imagawayaki

46
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,200
He's been eating out a lot since elementary school.

47
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,550
The soy-flour candy at that
 candy store in front of the school...

48
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,000
That was the best ever.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
Wow.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,560
Hiro would put so many of them into his mouth at once that he'd choke on them.

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,950
He kept wheezing, so the candy store lady called an ambulance one time.

52
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,750
That happened ?

53
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,760
Shut up.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,080
Hey, is your elementary
 school far from here ?

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,010
No, it's just a ten-minute walk.

56
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,580
I want to see it.

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,340
I don't want to see it.

58
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,720
Oh, I should show you the 
graduation totem pole that Hiro broke.

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,700
What's that ?

60
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,250
There's also the wall that Hiro tried to jump over and failed when he was late for class.

61
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm not going.

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,660
I said I'm not going !

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,400
Snow...

64
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,740
What was that ?

65
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,600
Hey, Hiro !

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,980
You're not coming, Kunimi ?

67
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,200
I guess I'll go.

68
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,820
Shouwa Year 47 Graduation 
Commemorative Totem Pole,
 Made by the Graduation Class

69
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,240
This is the totem pole that Hiro threw a stone at and broke.

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,780
He did that ?

71
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,850
According to him, he thought he could pull off a "daruma otoshi."

72
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,260
That was a pure and innocent idea, appropriate for a child.

73
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,250
Please Do Not Run
in the Hallway

74
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,200
Year 5, Class 3

75
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,850
Hiro

76
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,160
It feels small now.

77
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,240
This is where you two 
started playing baseball ?

78
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Yeah.

79
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,070
This elm tree never changes.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,290
We used to make throws
 from here to those iron bars.

81
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,160
When you were in elementary school ?

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,200
We reached there when we 
were in fifth grade, right, Noda ?

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,500
Even when you were
 little, you were amazing.

84
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,550
Shall we make a throw ?

85
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,520
All right.

86
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,500
Here I go !

87
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,810
Okay !

88
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,750
Hiro, here it comes !

89
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,000
Like that elm tree, I...

90
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,550
Hiro !

91
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,700
Kunimi !

92
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,700
Hiro !

93
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,650
Kunimi !

94
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,800
Hiro !

95
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,290
What was it ?

96
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,870
Kunimi ?

97
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,270
I forgot.

98
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,270
Please.

99
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,700
You're back, clean-up guy.

100
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,400
Yes.

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,450
Please.

102
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,310
All right.

103
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,470
Rehab is complete.

104
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,230
Amamiya Hikari,
 thanks for your work.

105
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,810
It's cold.

106
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,600
Sanpou Sports

107
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,430
Tachibana !

108
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,050
Sanpou Sports

109
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,050
Reporter,

Tokyo,
Adachi-ku,
Kobayashi
0-00-0

111
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,030
I'm Amamiya from Sanpou Sports.

112
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,930
Hello.

113
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,520
Mr. Amamiya...?

114
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,320
A memory from a snowy day ?

115
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,280
I think that's what it is, 
but I can't remember.

116
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,550
A snowball fight.

117
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,850
That's not it.

118
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,000
You made a snow hut.

119
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,910
That's not it, either.

120
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,310
Is it about when we drew pictures in the snow with our pee ?

121
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,970
That's definitely not it at all.

122
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,150
Is it about Hikari ?

123
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,380
Um, well, it's probably nothing.

124
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,800
I hope it'll accumulate.

125
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,530
If it does, you might remember.

126
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,720
Moron ! We won't be
 able to practice if it does !

127
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,100
That's true.

128
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,210
But today will also be a 
memorable day, wrapped up in snow.

129
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,400
Really, it's nothing.

130
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,010
That's what I said, 
but it bothers me.

131
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,160
Crap !

132
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,350
Hiro, you have a phone call !

133
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,110
Hikari's essay ?

134
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,080
When Haruka mentioned 
Hikari's name, I remembered.

135
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Something about snow, and the elm.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,020
She wrote something about that.

137
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,400
That must be it !

138
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,140
Can't you find it in the 
graduation essay collection ?

139
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,770
I can't read mine because of the scribbles you made.

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,990
Wait.

141
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,500
Found it.

142
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,500
Amamiya Hikari

Memories of 
Elementary School

143
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,600
Maybe not.

144
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,100
This might be it. You remember that we buried a time capsule, right ?

145
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,570
Didn't we put "My Treasure" into it ?

146
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,420
Huh ?

147
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,410
You put a ball in. I put a cap in. 
And I think Hikari put her essay in it.

148
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,800
Do you want to 
dig it up and see it ?

149
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,750
Moron ! That's meant to 
be a present for future kids.

150
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,380
Then there's only one way.

151
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,200
If you want to know what's in that essay, you should just ask Hikari.

152
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,640
It's nothing important.

153
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,840
It's not worth asking her about.

154
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
Just forget about it.

155
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,050
Well, even if they're
 not the tastiest things...

156
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,440
...you get nostalgic about cheap snacks and you somehow feel like eating them.

157
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,310


158
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Aim for the Koushien

159
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580


160
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,450
Aim for the Koushien

161
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,310
It's nothing important.

162
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,610
It's not worth asking her about.

163
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,600
Just forget about it.

164
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,300
It's cold.

165
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,160
Hey.

166
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,050
You're playing pachinko again ?

167
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,980
What do you mean "again" ?

168
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,190
I always see you near a pachinko place or a bar.

169
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,180
I've only seen you tending the store once or twice.

170
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,340
That's not nice to say.

171
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,400
I get up early in the morning...

172
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,080
...open the boxes of books delivered to us, and display them in the store.

173
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,510
And after everyone goes to sleep,
 I organize the receipts and do bookkeeping.

174
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,490
Man, I'm so busy.

175
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,300
Why don't you do all those things during the day...

176
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,750
...when you're otherwise just dawdling around ?

177
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,540
Pachinko places would close, you know ?

178
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,970
Pachinko places are open late, too.

179
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,700
In the evening hours, 
the good slots are all taken.

180
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,090
Oh, well. Because you're hardly ever home, people think that you've left.

181
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,790
Don't be silly.

182
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,530
Then do you know what Hikari's treasure
 was when she was in elementary school ?

183
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,110
Well, why don't you come to our
house for a cup of tea, for once ?

184
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,550
I always stop by your house.
You're just hardly ever there.

185
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,670
It's just that you're hardly ever there.

186
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,230
Really ?

187
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,500
Amamiya

188
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,370
Oh, how rare.

189
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,280
You're such a liar.

190
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,760
What do you mean, 
"I always stop by your house" ?

191
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,900
"How rare," she says.

192
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,800
I was talking about you, Dad.

193
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,060
Oh, I see.

194
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,460
Oh, Uncle is here.

195
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,780
Takaaki is here ?

196
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,370
It's been a while.

197
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,950
Takaaki is a newspaper reporter, right ?

198
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,570
Yeah, he's going back to the
 main office in Tokyo next year.

199
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,800
Oh.

200
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,770
Hey, Hiro, come here !

201
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,650
Sure.

202
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,740
Good evening.

203
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,550
Hiro, you've grown.

204
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
What happened to baseball ? 
Are you still playing ?

205
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,470
Yes.

206
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,160
Which school do you go to ?

207
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,540
It's Senkawa.

208
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,970
Senkawa ?

209
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,450
Their baseball club was 
established just recently.

210
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,770
Oh, is that true ?

211
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,020
Yes, it is.

212
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:25,330
Speaking of which, I just went to see Meiwa, the leading candidate for the Invitational.

213
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,250
So he says.

214
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,180
That guy, Tachibana Hideo, lives up to his reputation.

215
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,060
I think he's going to be a star player 
who will get people to come to the park.

216
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,450
So he says.

217
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,260
Yup.

218
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,330
He's smart, and he's thoughtful.

219
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,450
He'll do well in 
professional baseball, too.

220
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,690
If it's about Tachibana, it's 
way easier to just ask Hikari.

221
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,360
Huh ?

222
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,000
I just remembered.

223
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,760
Remembered what ?

224
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,500
The essay you wrote in elementary school, about your dream for the future.

225
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,400
It was to become a
 newspaper reporter, right ?

226
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,530
Yeah, a sports reporter.

227
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,300
That's right.

228
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,700
Wednesday, May 21st

229
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,700
Class Newspaper

230
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,700
This Week's Kunimi and Noda

231
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,600
This Week's Kunimi and Noda
He threw 70 meters !

232
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like that elm tree, I'd like to be
 someone who will never change.

233
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,250
Can it be...?

234
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,120
Can it be what ?

235
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,450
Is that still what you want to do ?

236
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,250
You think it's impossible, don't you ?

237
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,000
No.

238
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,760
I think you can do it.

239
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,260
When I told Hide-chan about it, he didn't take me seriously.

240
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,190
It's because you never
 show your true self to Hideo.

241
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,410
Huh ?

242
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,900
When you're with him,
 you act like a docile, nice girl.

243
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,450
Hideo doesn't know how 
stubborn or strong-willed you are.

244
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,000
Hmm.

245
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,100
Boys want to show their good sides when they're with girls, too, right ?

246
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,240
If you don't show him your true character from time to time, it'll be stressful.

247
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,460
Oh ?

248
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,410
Didn't you say you're done playing the go-between ?

249
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,120
Hmm...

250
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,120
Hikari and Tachibana Hideo...

251
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,500
Are you surprised ?

252
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,120
Well, I have no complaint about it.

253
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,970
But as a pair, 
it feels a bit strange.

254
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,000
Is that a news reporter's intuition ?

255
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,130
Well, it's not anything reliable.

256
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,720
My image of Hikari is that of her when 
she was in elementary school, after all.

257
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,880
I see.

258
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,500
It's cold.

259
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,130
My treasure...

260
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,470
...is my dream.

261
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,800
Memories are memories.

262
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,780
I'm home.

263
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,860
Oh, he's home now ! 
He's home now !

264
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,800
Hey, moronic son.

265
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,510
You have a phone call from the company president's daughter.

266
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,450
What's up ?

267
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,000
Hey !

268
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,040
The snow is beautiful ? 
Are you a moron ?

269
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,310
Ugh...!

270
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,260
All the powerhouse schools 
have indoor workout facilities.

271
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,610
If this weather continues, 
they'll get even further ahead of us.

272
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,140
Tomorrow, we'll start to remove the snow from the field in the morning.

273
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,500
So get up early.

274
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,700
Speak more politely...

275
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,670
I can't wake up by myself, so come pick me up.

276
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,400
What have you done...?

277
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,770
Six o'clock ? 
Moron ! It's too early !

278
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,650
Honey...

279
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah, I guess that sounds right.

280
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,810
Okay.

281
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,830
Huh ? What ? 
The snow is beautiful ?

282
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,870
You're still talking about that ?

283
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,900
You have to live for the future ! 
For the future !

284
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:31,450
Like that elm tree, I want to be someone who'll never change.

285
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,690
He remembered.

286
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,700
My treasure.

287
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,920
It is my dream.

288
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,400
When I see that elm tree in the schoolyard, I always feel it.

289
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,550
In snow or rain, that elm tree has always encouraged me.

290
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,730
That's why I want to
 be like that elm tree.

291
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:09,530
I like baseball. I like how everyone works hard and plays the game.

292
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,660
I want other people to know this feeling, so I'd like to be a sports reporter.

293
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,380
I think that, if I work hard like that elm tree, my dream will someday come true.

294
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,360
You think it's impossible, don't you ?

295
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,150
No, I think you can.

296
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,480
Yup.

Notes:
 "Monja" is like okonomiyaki, but a thinner version of it. 

"Imagawayaki" is a type of Japanese muffin, containing bean jam, and served hot.

"Daruma otoshi" is a type of game. 
See http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daruma_doll under the subheading, "Children's games"

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:45,880

314
00:22:52,920 --> 00:23:01,230
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

315
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,530
"I'm definitely glad we met."

316
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,350
Let's stay strong and move forward.

317
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,080
When I'm by myself I notice...

318
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,030
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

319
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,830
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

320
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,080
...there are more and more smiles.

321
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,530
