Presented by Central Anime

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,670
A rock concert I went to with Hikari.

13
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,400
Service suspended between
Shirai and Mikami,
due to flooding on the tracks. 
Thank you for your patience.

14
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,640
Because of a rainstorm, 
train service stopped...

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,220
...and many accidents followed.

16
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,150
"Up-bound" train service
has ended for today.

17
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,450
We couldn't go home...

18
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,010
...and we, Hikari and I, ended up in a scenario where we had to spend the night together.

19

 Episode 23

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,500
I Can't Sleep...

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,500
A Night With Just the Two of Us

22
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,630


23

Concert Site

24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,390
Welcome to our inn.

25
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, I'm glad we were able to find a nice inn, Big Sister.

26
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

27
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,020
Well, there was the rainstorm, and then a childbirth.

28
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,730
In the end, we missed the last train.

29
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,750
It really was awful today, Big Sister.

30
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,650
You're right.

31
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,550
But the concert was great,
 so I guess it balances out.

32
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,270
Right, Big Sister ?

33
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,180
Yeah.

34
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,100


35
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,650
The bath is open 24 hours.

36
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,450
Oh, it is ?

37
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,150
That's great.

38
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,770
I'll take a relaxing bath and 
recover from the long day.

39
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,420
Right, Big Sister ?

40
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,650
Yeah.

41
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,120
Well, please enjoy your stay.

42
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,990
She looked like she was a little 
suspicious, didn't she, Big Sister ?

43
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,560
I suppose.

44
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,650
It might have worked three years ago...

45
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,420
...but now, it's a bit of a stretch to present ourselves as siblings.

46
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,900
I wonder what we seemed like to her.

47
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,350
Who knows ?

48
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,450
Keep it clean.

49
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,710
I thought we bought two.

50
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
One of them is for Hide-chan.

51
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,990
Oh.

52
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,200
You bought two T-shirts, too, right ?

53
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,990
Yep.

54
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,000
For a thing like this.

55
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,420
What do you mean,
 "For a thing like this" ?

56
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,160
Oh, nothing.

57
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
It's just that if we
 hadn't bought that stuff...

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,880
...we might have been able to get a taxi to go home.

59
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,160
Are you trying to 
say this is my fault ?

60
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,440
Not really. I just thought we might have gotten a taxi to go home.

61
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,650
You don't give up, do you ?

62
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,170
You should be glad that 
we're not sleeping outdoors.

63
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,640
Yeah.

64
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,290
I'm going to call home.

65
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,130
Okay.

66
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,800
What does she plan to tell them ?

67
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:48,620


68
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,850
You missed the last train ?
The concert was that long ?

69
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah. So I'll stay overnight tonight.

70
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,200
Honestly, you're so troublesome.

71
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,550
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,650
But Hiro is with you, right ?

73
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,440
Yeah.

74
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,350
Okay then. Don't worry your parents too much, okay ?

75
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,900
Sure. Bye.

76
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,840
Oh, yes. You had a phone call, from Tachibana.

77
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,800
Yasui Inn

78
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,990
Oh.

79
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,220
What did your mother say ?

80
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,400
About what ?

81
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,000
You explained to her why this happened, right ?

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,650
The ring search, the 
childbirth incident, and such.

83
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,810
Not really.

84
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,930
What ?

85
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,590
I just said that we missed the train, so we'd stay overnight. That's all.

86
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,700
Hey...

87
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,510
I mean, the more I explain things,
the more it sounds like an excuse.

88
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,550
And your mother didn't say anything ?

89
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,380
She's not worried because you're with me, I guess.

90
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,320
Wasn't the last time we looked like siblings three years ago ?

91
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,930
To my mother, you're
like a part of the family.

92
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,120
Oh, well.

93
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,370
I guess she doesn't understand how her daughter looks to boys our age.

94
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,750
How do I look to them ?

95
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,510
Huh ?

96
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,580
Hmm...

97
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,370
I mean, you know, well it's like...

98
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,000
...you're an attractive woman
who makes men's hearts throb.

99
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,040
This is the first time 
I've been told that.

100
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,150
What are you talking about ?

101
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:48,150
Since junior high, you've received piles of love letters with corny phrases like that.

102
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,650
By you, I mean.

103
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,550
Yasui Inn

104
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,500
Well, we were so close
 that I didn't see you clearly.

105
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
It's only recently...

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,500
...that I started to vaguely understand why
 the guys around me were fussing over you.

107
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,920
I wasn't seeing you clearly, either.

108
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,200
Because you were too small.

109
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,850
No !

110
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, man.

111
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,550
It was healing well, but because of this stupid concert, it's swelling up again.

112
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,950
See ?

113
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,410
Oh, it's true.

114
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
What do you mean, "it's true" ?

115
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,450
Aren't you supposed to
worry or something ?

116
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,900
The bath here seems 
to be good for bruises.

117
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,490
Oh, I see.

118
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,250
Then I'll go take a bath, Big Sister.

119
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,600
Large Public Bath

120
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,200
Hot water

121
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,200
Hot water

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Women

123
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,700
It's hot !

124
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,450
Hm ?

125
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,300
Uh, oh !

126
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,800
It's a mixed bath ?

127
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,230
Is it the common setup...

128
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,230
...where there are separate entrances but they go to the same place ?

129
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,580
That means... 

130
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,820
What ?

131
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,740
Crap !

132
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,840
EYECATCH

133
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,250
So I missed the last train.

134
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,150
I didn't have enough money for a taxi, but I
had enough to stay the night at a cheap inn.

135
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,550
What a coincidence.

136
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,180
We came for the same concert, and ended up at the same inn for similar reasons.

137
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,270
Right.

138
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,300
So who did you come with ?

139
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,480
You didn't come here alone, did you ?

140
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,610
Ah.

141
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,100
It's Noda.

142
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
I see.

143
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,960
What about you ?

144
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,650
Don't ask such a thoughtless question.

145
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:37,800
Do you think I would come this far for a concert with a guy ?

146
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,500
Huh ?

147
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,250
Don't tell anyone you saw me here.

148
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,270
Lots of girls will be
sad if they find out.

149
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,340
Sure.

150
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,200
I'll get going, then.

151
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,910
Sure.

152
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,900
Well, it probably goes without saying, but don't intrude on us, okay ?

153
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,320
No way I would.

154
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,100
You came here with a guy, huh ?

155
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm envious that you
can be so carefree.

156
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,200
Don't come peeping on us, okay ?

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,560
No way I would.

158
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,540
Hey, Kine. 
Lend me a 100 yen coin.

159
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,860
I can't watch the porn channel.

160
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,450
100 yen.

161
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,300
It's hot.

162
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,000
That was such a long bath.

163
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,400
I guess.

164
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,700
Can you get out of the way ?

165
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,850
I want to get my bag.

166
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,900
Well, I guess I'll watch some TV.

167
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,720
 Silly !

168
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,100
You don't have to stop.

169
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Well, if I start to watch, I can't stop.

170
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,830
Oh, is that how it is ?

171
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:30,890
Wow...

172
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,610
Do you want something to drink ?

173
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,630
No thanks.

174
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,090
What's so good about this stuff ?

175
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,580
People who don't understand won't understand.

176
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,020
I guess that's true.

177
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,910
Do you want to use the brush ?

178
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:51,980
With each palm touching the other's, we walked in the sun.

179
00:16:51,980 --> 00:17:00,990
It's full of warmth, and we talked about lots of things.

180
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:11,030
Being together shouldn't feel painful.

181
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:20,800
Just keep carrying this brimming feeling.

182
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:30,390
There are many things where just
 being kind doesn't move us forward.

183
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:42,510
But I don't hesitate to do things
for you, and for the two of us.

184
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:52,100
There will be a day when you can 
see love like a gentle rainbow.

185
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,250
If you don't try to notice...

186
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,650
...you'll overlook it, and you'll make a mistake.

187
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:11,200
As we repeat the laughing and smiling...

188
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:19,610
...everyday that we can't relive is formed.

189
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,240
You want the futons further apart ?

190
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,650
It doesn't matter.

191
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,700
Either way, I can't escape if you come after me.

192
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,670
What do you mean by that ?

193
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,650
Back in the day, I could 
beat you in a sumo match.

194
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,550
But now, I don't stand
 a chance even if I resist.

195
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,530
Hey...

196
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,780
Now, let's go to bed.

197

Yasui Inn

199
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,200
She feels safe falling asleep even though I'm right by her.

200
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,750
Nothing has changed
since three years ago.

201
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,590
Do you regret introducing Hikari to Tachibana ?

202
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,050
Let's go to the Koushien, Manager.

203
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,630
This is troubling.

204
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,790
I can't sleep...

205
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,270
...Hide-chan.

213
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:30,830
Notes:
Noda was reading "Saturday" and if you looked closely
 at the front you'll see H2.

Yasui Inn Unspoken Joke: The name of the inn is a joke. 
"Yasui" is an actual surname, but it is also a homophone for the word, "cheap."  So it sounds the same as "Cheap Inn."

214
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:33,730
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

215
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:37,660
Notes:


216
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:41,580
...rather than the footsteps that


 sound further and further away.

222
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,180
The star I'm watching today...

223
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,660
...glistened yesterday.

224
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,280
In the town full of things that disappear...

225
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,410
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

226
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:07,360
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

227
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:15,510
...rather than losing our time to regret.

228
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,910
Happiness is not something...

229
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,740
...that someone does for me.

230
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:32,310
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

231
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,290
The Koushien tournament has ended, and summer is nearing its end.

232
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,750
Yeah, but there's still one more event remaining.

233
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,100
Oh, the fireworks display.

234
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,470
That's right. So let's not be 
awkward with each other.

235
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,490
What are you talking about ?

236
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,620
I mean, about us 
spending the night together.

237
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't worry about that at all.

238
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,880
Really ?

239
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,610
Next episode of H2 is, "The Summer for Each of Us, Like Fireworks."

240
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,100
I Can't Sleep...

241
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,100
Next episode of H2 is

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,100
The Summer for Each of Us, Like Fireworks

243
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,100
Look forward to it !

244
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,750
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

245
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,170
