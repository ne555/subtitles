00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,450
Repeating seasons...

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,750
...and accumulating memories.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,750
Like in childhood...

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,850
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,900
When I stumble and look downward...

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,400
Tears flow and shine, but...

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,870
Back to the ground

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,500
A smile heals wounded wings.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,700
Back to the ground

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:52,300
The wind and the earth embrace me.

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,200
I don't care what anyone says...

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,750
...because I believe in myself.

14
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,060
Someday, I will come close...

15
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,550
...to this big, endless dream.

Presented by Central Anime

17
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,590
This summer, we fought against Meiwa with all our passion.

18
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,310
And our baseball club was established.


19
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,910
As all of us store our feelings within 
our hearts, the summer has passed.

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,450
The construction of Senkawa High School's baseball club field began.

21
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,490
And yes, a new season has come for us.

22
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,930

Senkawa High School Baseball Field Construction Site

27
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,920
You're early.

28
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,100
Who are you ?

29
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,850
I'm Hikari, the only daughter of Amamiya Bookstore.

30
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,780
You don't remember ?

31
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,200
The new semester is starting, and you're going to be late.

32
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,360
Your baseball club is starting.

33
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,590
You came by just to say that ?

34
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,900
It's because you didn't come by.

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,540
"Hikari, we have a game today."

36
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,750
"Hikari, I'm pitching for
 the first time today."

37
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,820
...

38
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,490
The one who always reported
 everything to me was you, Mister.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,860
We go to different schools. There will be times I won't take the trouble to keep you posted.

40
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,090
Is that how it is ?

41
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,020
That's how it is.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,370
I guess it is.

43
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,210
Hikari, you probably know this already, but our baseball club starts today.

44
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,490
You should get fired up !

45
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,000
I am !

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,840
Run, Kunimi Hiro !

47
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,650
Yeah !

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,600
Hey.

49
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh, hello.

50
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,700
Private School - Senkawa High School

51
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,600
Senkawa High School Baseball Club

52
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,600
Participants Wanted !

53
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,600
Back Up the 
Hot Blood!

54
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,600
Heroes,
 Come Out

55
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,480
Oh, we have a baseball club now ?

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,000
I hear that they put up a good fight against Meiwa Daiichi.

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,990
Who was it ? There was someone who put in a great performance.

58
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,670


59
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,490
Who was it ?

60
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,780
You know, the guy who 
was in the soccer club.

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,040


62
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,520
Oh, you mean Kunimi !

63
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,550
There was someone else, too.

64
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,710
There were others, not just Kunimi.

65
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,300
Yeah, that's right.

66
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,030
Right, there was Noda.

67
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,150
No !

68
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,990
Yanagi did well, too.

69
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,790
Hey, ace striker.

70
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,600
That's right.
 I'm the ace striker...

71
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,190
I hear that you played 
in that game, too.

72
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,670
Well, for me, their style of
baseball is just child's play.

73
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,230
But really, it's impressive.

74
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,860
Well, I gave it a 
little bit of my best.

75
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,470
Kine, you're in the soccer club, right ?

76
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,040
O...of course, Captain !

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,900
Oh gosh, why do you ask ?

78
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,030
That's fine then.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,950
Club

80
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,450
Okay, it's done.

81
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,850
Baseball Club

82
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,330
Baseball Club.

83
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,520
Yeah, it sounds great.

84
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,240
Yeah.

85
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,040
With this, we third years 
have no more regrets.

86
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,470
We're going to retire, but 
good luck to the rest of you.

87
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,000
Thank you, Seniors !

88
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,890
I got it !

89
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:27,100
Baseball Club

90
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,900
Is everyone here ?

91
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,730
I don't know how long 
we've all waited for this !

92
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,630
Don't cry.

93
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,240
Huh ? Where are Kunimi and Noda ?

94
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,800
Girls' Track Team

95
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,550
It's heavy today. It's not good.

96
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,250
Yeah, let's hang in there.

97
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,150
I have to do the hurdles today.

98
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,310
It's a great environment.

99
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,600
Yeah, we have a great view.

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,450
Um...

101
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,270
I mean, the track team's practice is great for building lean muscle.

102
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,990
That's right. It's worth 
researching for training methods.

103
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,350
I feel like I got faster 
during summer break.

104
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,550
This is nice.

105
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm opening it.

106
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:32,720


107
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,670
This is the club room for the
Senkawa High School Baseball Club.

108
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,730
We did it ! 
This feels like a dream !

109
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,300
This is the Baseball Club's floor !

110
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,430
It's kind of big.

111
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,480
This has been our dream !

112
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,670


113
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,400
Hey.

114
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,500
Hello.

115
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,850
Who is he ?

116
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,140
He's our manager's big brother.

117
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,550
What are you doing here ?

118
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,550
This and that.

119
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,500
Can we remove the rope ?

120
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,020
Sure.

121
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,460
Your brother works
 for a transport company ?

122
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,680
I heard he got a job, but...

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,590
Do it from that side.

124
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,090
You're siblings and you
don't talk to one another ?

125
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,330
There's a big age difference.

126
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,310
Wow ! We've got 
so many new balls !

127
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,020
We have bats and gloves, too.

128
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,390
The construction of our baseball field has begun, too. We're getting everything we need !

129
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,400
My father is thorough when 
he decides to do something.

130
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,800
Hiro, take that side.

131
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,200
Hey.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,060
Akagi...

133
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,180
What are you doing ?
Let's lend them a hand.

134
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,540
Okay...

135
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,600
Thank you.

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,720
We appreciate it.

137
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,000
Akagi.

138
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,250
Kunimi, since you're a 
former soccer club member...

139
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,650
...I wanted to congratulate you on your new start.

140
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,800
So we came here to help. 
Right, Kine ?

141
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,440
 Um, that's right.

142
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,100
Thanks.

143
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,400
You're all legitimate baseball club members. You should hold your heads high.

144
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,600
The people I dislike the most are ones who don't stand tall.

145
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,580
...

146
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,250
He was peeking in all along.

147
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,350
Well, it was just a matter of how long he could continue to peek in and refrain from joining us.

148
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,700
Kunimi.

149
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,200
You want me to, Captain ?

150
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,020
Um, I'm still not used
to being called "Captain."

151
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,480
Anyway, take a look.

152
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,850
Yamaguchi and the other 
seniors have just retired...

153
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,230
...and I want to stand firm as the new captain, but...

154
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,650
"50 practice swings" "Catch 30 minutes" "Tee batting 1 hour"}

155
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,650
Practice Menu
Running 15 minutes
Stretching 10 minutes
30 sit-ups
30 push-ups
50 practice swings
Catch 30 minutes
Tee batting 1 hour

156
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,950
You can change it as you see fit.

157
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,060
But is it okay for a first year like 
me to set the practice menu ?

158
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,460
If you do it, everyone
will go along with it.

159
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,160
Hmm...

160
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,800
Let's establish this baseball club's tradition together !

161
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,300
Let's do it.

162
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,040
Um.

163
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,750
Meiwa Daiichi High School

164
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,700
Body, Mind, Heart

165
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, no...

166
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,650
What is it ? It's creepy.

167
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,400
I can just picture Hiro.

168
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
Hiro ?

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,260
He's probably making a
 difficult face and working hard.

170
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,600
Ah.

171
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,670
And he's acting
 like he's not fired up.

172
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,670
He wears a poker
face at critical times.

173
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,040
Especially when he's 
entrusted with important tasks.

174
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,080
His personality is suited
to being a pitcher.

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,200
He's suited to be a pitcher, huh ?

176
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,230
Man, you're so easily moved
by words like "starting a tradition."

177
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,100
Are you one to talk ?

178
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,310
Well...

179
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,800
So...

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,890
No.

181
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,300
Two hundred practice swings.

182
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Won't that be too 
hard for everyone ?

183
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,390
They'll try hard.

184
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,430
Then push-ups.

185
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,250


186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,300
Sit-ups ?

187
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,860


188
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,000
We won't be able to use the field for a while, after all.

189
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,990
We'll work on playing catch and
 building fundamental body strength.

190
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,570
That's right.

191
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,980
Speaking of which, why is he here ?

192
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,960
Maybe he's a sociable person.

193
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,930
EYECATCH

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,770
So how's the baseball club going ?

195
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,310
It's amazingly fun.

196
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,900
After all, the girls' track team club room is next to ours.

197
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,250
Huh ?

198
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,310
We get a parade of beautiful legs.

199
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,290
Oh, you must feel lucky.

200
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,950
It's so irresistible, right ?

201
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,650
Yeah.

202
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,600
You guys are talking about
that kind of stuff again ?

203
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm not going to show it to you.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,060
I thought you were
focused on baseball.

205
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,000
It just started. We're still
in a preparatory stage.

206
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,750
Practice Menu:
Running 30 minutes
Stretching 20 minutes
50 sit-ups
50 push-ups
200 practice swings
Play Catch 1 hour
Tee batting 2 hours

207
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,680
Hmm.

208
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,930
We do twice as much as this.

209
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,960
Noda, multiply that by two.

210
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,740
Don't get worked up.

211
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,550
So who's your coach ?

212
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,610
Huh ?

213
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,500
Coach ?

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,700
What ?

215
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,030
I don't know...

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Senkawa

217
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,200
Kunimi, is this "road work for 1 hour"...

218
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,660
...which is written after 50 push-ups and 50 sit-ups, for tomorrow ?

219
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,550
No, it's all for one day.

220
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,150
Oh, I see...

221
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,000
It's the first step toward the Koushien.

222
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,380
Oh...

223
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,340
What ?

224
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,090
The Koushien ?

225
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,970
No way...

226
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,790
By the way, what happened to the coach issue ?

227
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,650
I was told to come to the Principal's Office later.

228
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,400
I think it's about that matter.

229
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,720
I see. I'm looking forward to that.

230
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,350
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight...

231
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:26,200
...fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight.

232
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,680
He's here again.

233
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,250
Hey.

234
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,350
Hello.

235
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,800
Hey.

236
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,050
He must have a lot 
of time on his hands.

237
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,880
I guess.

238
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,490


239
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,710
Fight, fight...

240
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,720
Let's slow down.

241
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,550
I guess.

242
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,800
Things are just starting out, after all.

243
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,350
Abrupt and excessive workouts will fatigue them, rather than building physical strength.

244
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,140
We should take it one step at a time.

245
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,670
Senkawa Baseball Club, hang in there !

246
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,200
You seem happy.

247
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,500
I can call them
 "baseball club," after all.

248
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,530
But I wonder if things
 have really changed.

249
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,600
Things are definitely changing.

250
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,900
I can't actually 
feel the difference yet.

251
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,880
The wind feels different, doesn't it ?

252
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,080
The wind ?

253
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,660
Okay, let's go.

254
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,880
What ? Still...?

255
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,410
Yes, it's the autumn wind.

256
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Dammit !

257
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,870
Goal !

258
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,460
What ? They're worn 
out after the roadwork ?

259
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,500
I can't bear to watch this. 
Man, they're beyond help.

260
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,230
Honestly, he's beyond help.

261
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,350
I can't do this anymore...

262
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,300
This is hard...

263
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,700
This really is...hard.

264
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,570
No...

265
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,310
Maybe this practice 
menu is a bit much.

266
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
They just haven't 
found their pace yet.

267
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,850
Captain.

268
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,210
Captain.

269
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,540
Arikawa.

270
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,650
Oh, me.

271
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,960
The principal wants you.

272
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,550
Is it the coach thing ?

273
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,200
Probably.

274
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,750
Phew, it's cold !

275
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,430
But really, are we going to do
 this much in practice every day ?

276
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,990
We're going for the Koushien, after all.

277
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,390
The Koushien, huh ?

278
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,860
Yes, the Koushien.

279
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,650
Didn't we just want to
 play baseball for fun ?

280
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,200
Yeah, I suppose so.

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,180
The Koushien is just a pipe-dream.

282
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,280
Rather, it's more of
 a joke than a dream.

283
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,540
What ? Are you 
giving up on the Koushien ?

284
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,080
How many high schools do you think there are ?

285
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,380
It's impossible.

286
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,750
It's definitely impossible.

287
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,060
This is pathetic. They've finally
 become a baseball club, and this is it ?

288
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,400
Akagi.

289
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
What brings you here ?

290
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I said come here !

291
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,700
I'll tell you why I've always
 thought you were pathetic !

292
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,650
 As a player and as a teammate !

293
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,000
Teammates ?

294
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,150
Kunimi, where are you headed ?

295
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,800
To the Koushien, Akagi.

296
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,700
I'm going to the National Stadium.

297
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,540
Knowing where we're headed
 makes things clear and easy, right ?

298
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,650
That's right.

299
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,000
Even if it's tough, we work hard.

300
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,570
And that makes it even more worthwhile when we actually get there, right ?

301
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,000
I feel sorry for people
 who don't have a goal.

302
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,100
Is he a protagonist
 in a young-adult drama ?

303
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,200
The baseball fan club was just a trifle.

304
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,650
But you guys worked hard to create a baseball club so that you could go to the Koushien.

305
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,500
And that impressed me.

306
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,720
Wow, he's starting to get 
carried away all on his own.

307
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,420
I started to have a dream. Don't give up halfway !

308
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,090
Keep running until the end !

309
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,910
Got that ?

310
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,000
Y...yes.

311
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,750
Now, 200 practice swings, right ?

312
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,770
Oh no, he's here again ?

313
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,530
I'm going to do it.

314
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,630
We'll make our dream come true !

315
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,700
And then there's 
someone who gets excited.

316
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,350
The wind is cool, and it feels good.

317
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,540
Let's take it one step at a time, at your own pace.

318
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,550
Yeah.

319
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,550
As long as you do it until the end.

320
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,800
Until our dream...

321
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,600
...comes true ?

322
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,380
Yes.

323
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,790
After the practice swings,
 you'll hit 100 tosses.

324
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,580
Yeah !

325
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,180
Now, let's get back to training !

326
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,430
Yeah ! Aim for the Koushien !

327
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,430
Aim for Koushien !

328
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,310
Let's do it !

329
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,710
They're such strange people.

330
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,880
Kine.

331
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,700
Which one do you want to pursue ?

332
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,100
The National or the Koushien ?

333
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,190
Both.

334
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,350
He who runs after two hares will catch neither, they say.

335
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,500
But you won't know until
you run after them, right ?

336
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,260


337
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,730
What's with that swing ?

338
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,270
You're still swinging like a mosquito can land on it  !

339
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,400
It's the hip rotation ! It's the hips !

340
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,480
The noisy one is back.

341
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,300
Yeah.

342
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,890
Hey ! You should properly file the enrollment form !

343
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,850
Don't be such a square. 
We know each other so well.

344
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,710
How much do we 
really know each other ?

345
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,400
Captain, what happened
 to the coach issue ?

346
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,890
Him...

347
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,700
Oh, he's my brother.

348
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,580
Oh, he's my brother. I'm sorry. He just has too much time on his hands.

349
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,580
I'm sorry. He just has too much time on his hands.

350
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,680
That's not it. Um...

351
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,200
Hey, guys, come over here.

352
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,300
This is...

353
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,040
This is our manager's big brother.

354
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,480
Hello.

355
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,390
Nice to meet you.

356
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,750
I mean...

357
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,550
So what happened to the coach ?

358
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm Koga Fujio.

359
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,130
Huh...?

360
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,260
So what happened to the coach ?

361
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,470
Nice to meet you.

362
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,530

"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

380
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:57,800
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

381
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,980
"I'm definitely glad we met."

386
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,850
...there are more and more smiles.

387
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,050
Just by looking at you, see ?

388
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,850

Hiro, you guys are going to play a game,
 even though your field's not finished ?

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,270
The third years are retiring
 after summer, you know.

392
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,730
They become busy studying for the entrance exam, after all.

393
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,750
If the seniors hadn't formed the fan club, we wouldn't have been here.

394
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,370
So you're going to play a send-off game, to express your gratitude.

395
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,270
But the opponent team is...

396
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,600
