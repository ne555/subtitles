...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

One day, during summer break...

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,480
...I pinch-hit for Hideo, and 
went out on a date with Hikari.

18
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,550
"Up-bound" train service
has ended for today.

19
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,620
Did Hikari tell Hideo that we couldn't 
go home and spent the night together ?

Hikari !

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,110
It looks like it's going to rain.

27
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,360
You should go home early.

28
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,880
Working overtime ?

29
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,700
Yeah, the fall tournament starts tomorrow.

30
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,670
See you.

It looks like it's going to rain.

33
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,400
I hear that a typhoon is coming.

34
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,680
I thought it was your stomach.

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,000
You heard it ? Let's eat 
some ramen and go home.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,610
Let's do that.

37
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,680
Autumn is the season of appetite.
 If you work out hard, you get hungry.

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,050
That's right !

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,850
Let's go ! Let's go !

40
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,800
But we have to go Dutch.

Rain...

44
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,300
She feels safe falling asleep, even though I'm right by her.

Nothing has changed

46
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,370
I guess Meiwa's first game tomorrow will be called off.

47
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,640
Autumn is definitely
the season for sports !

48
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,420
Yeah.

49
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,460
Hey.

50
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,250
You know him ?

51
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,290
Yeah.

52
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,800
Who is he ?

53
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,550
He was a neighbor when we were in elementary school.

54
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,050
He'd moved away 5 years ago,
 but he came back here, apparently.

55
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,830
Were you a good friend of his ?

56
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,560
Yeah, we used to hang out a lot.

57
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,200
Hey, Rival.

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,750
You seem to be on
 top of your game.

59
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,900
Well, you should enjoy it while it lasts, 
until our baseball club joins the competition.

60
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,100
Our baseball club ?

61
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,700
You don't even come to our practice. You shouldn't act tough.

62
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,010
Don't worry about that. Once the ballpark is built, I'll come to your practice, too.

63
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,210
After all, I'm busy playing 
both soccer and baseball.

64
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,620
Between those, 
I have to go on dates, too.

65
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,990
Why are you acting so vain ?

66
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,050
You didn't tell anyone what 
happened the other day, did you ?

67
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,760
What happened the other day ?

68
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,200
You know, at the inn where we spent the night, after the outdoor concert.

69
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,400
Hmm ?

70
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:19,200
Oh well. She tells me, "I don't want to go home tonight."

71
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,760
By coincidence, we ended up in the same inn as you two.

72
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,100
You two ?

73
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
You and Kunimi.

74
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,300
And my partner was...

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,240
Don't imagine something naughty, okay ?

76
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,980
We spent the night purely as 
wholesome high school students.

77
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,350
I didn't go to any outdoor concert.

78
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,970
Huh ?

79
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,650
What ?

80
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,150
Hiro was also with a girl that night.

81
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,050
And she was an absolute beauty.

82
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,900
What ? Did you lie to me ?

83
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,120
That's unfair !

84
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
You spent the night
 with a girl at that inn ?

85
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,550
Damn you...

86
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,000
As for us...

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Us...

88
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
"As for us" ?

89
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,940
Well, we popular guys have
 our own hardships, I suppose.

90
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,100
Go, go [team name indistinguishable]

91
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,600
Oh, it's time for the game.

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
Now, make sure to cheer for me.

93
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,990
Well, you should enjoy it while it lasts, 
until our baseball club joins the competition.

94
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,370
Our baseball club ?

95
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,380
You don't even come to practice. You shouldn't act tough.

96
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,190
Don't worry about that. Once the ballpark is built, I'll come to your practice, too.

97
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,910
Hey, Kunimi !

98
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,200
The girl you spent the night with wasn't Koga, was it ?

99
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Of course not, moron.

100
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,610
It was my big sister.

101
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,360
That's what I thought !

102
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,100

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Hiro.

105
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,550
Your sister's here.

113
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,240
Strike. Batter out.

114
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,320
He must totally trust you.

115
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,350
Who ?

116
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,500
Batting fourth, third baseman, Tachibana.

117
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,980
Well, you could also say that 
my best friend has a big heart.

118
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,510
What are you talking about ?

119
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm talking about us spending the night together after the concert.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,600
Ball.

121
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,200
Because you told him
 about it, it saved me.

122
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,650
I thought about telling him. 
He called me after I came home.

123
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,500
But it was from camp, and
 his seniors were teasing him.

124
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,420
So he hung up right away.

125
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,000
He really is a big-shot.

126
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,700
If I were him, I wouldn't 
be feeling at peace.

127
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,150
Out.

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,220
What happened ?

129
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,650
Well...

130
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,170
...it looks like he forgot
 to step on home plate.

131
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,910
Even then, he went 3 for 4.

132
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,170
If he had that homerun,
it would have been for the cycle.

133
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,350
Ugh !

134
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,800
EYECATCH

135
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,470
He attacked me first.

136
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:41,010
I don't know who's at fault here, but it's clear who's stronger.

137
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,590
Picking on the weak isn't cool.

138
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,600
When I fight, I fight to the end.

139
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,800
Or are you going
 to pick up this fight ?

140
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,450
You'd better refrain.
It's clear who's stronger.

141
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,060
...?

142
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,800
Baseball club ?

143
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
Just established.

144
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,440
Are you sure that baseball club 
guys can afford to get into a fight ?

145
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,650
Whether it's a baseball club or the tea ceremony club...

146
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,910
...there's no club where its members are allowed to get into a fight.

147
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,000
I have this habit where I do practice
 swings without checking my surroundings.

148
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,380
No matter how hard
 you try, it'll be all in vain.

149
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,800
As long as Tachibana Hideo is around, you can never go to the Koushien.

150
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,050
Hard work is never wasted,
even if it doesn't lead to the Koushien.

151
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,400
I don't know what he was like as a child, but I wouldn't want to hang out with him.

152
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
Aim for the Koushien ! 
Tachibana Hideo

153
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
0:04:02.00 0:04:03.00  

154
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Hide-chan.

155
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,950
He's not here.

156
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,720
...?

157
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,680
Do you want a piece of apple ?

158
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,700
I don't want a piece of apple.

159
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,970
Oh, I see.

160
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,340
Who are you ?

161
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,150
Sagawa Shuuji.
 I'm Hide-chan's childhood friend.

162
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,750
We used to be good friends.
 We always did things together.

163
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,700
What was mine was Hide-chan's. What was Hide-chan's was mine.

164
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,810
If you come any closer,
 I'm going to shout.

165
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,970
You shouldn't do that.

166
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,030
It'll be dangerous if I get startled and my hand slips as I peel the apple.

167
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,600
Oh, a cockroach.

168
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,600
That's such an overused tactic.

169
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,200
It's flying.

170
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,220
Stop that already...

171
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,880
Shit !

172
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,330
Hey ! Open up !

173
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,900
What's the ruckus ?

174
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,650
You're being a nuisance to the neighbors.

175
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Hey.

176
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,550
Hi, Hiro.

177
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,240
Do you want an apple ?

178
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,200
You little...! It's mine !

179
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,400
Sorry about that.

180
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,600
I have this habit where I do practice 
swings without checking my surroundings.

181
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,480
Here.

182
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,930
If you have a message
 for Hideo, I'll take it.

183
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,320
Tell him to work hard and become more famous.

184
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,660
Tachibana Hideo is
 the pride of us brothers.

185
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,400
Brothers ?

186
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,450
Oh, welcome home, Hide-chan.

187
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,980
What are you doing ?

188
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,500
Can't you tell ?
 We're comparing heights.

189
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm just trying to figure out how much taller I'm going to get.

190
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,500
Do it in your room.

191
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,300
Here. It's something your 
childhood friend left behind.

192
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,780
He was here ?

193
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,700
He seems like a tough fighter, but he seems to dislike cockroaches.

194
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,040
He was already in the room. I was taken by surprise.

195
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,050
I almost shouted.

196
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,010
I was surprised, too, to see him for the first time in a long while.



197
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,210
Okay, let's pull ourselves together.

198
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,120
Let's go !

199
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,360
One more !

200
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,950
He's working overtime today, too.

201
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,200
Hikari !

202
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey !

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,660
Hikari, let's walk home together.

204
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,270
Yeah.

205
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,810


206
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,350
You're so handsome !

207
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,090
Look this way, please !

208
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,550
What's going on ?

209
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,120
If you could act as his girlfriend for a day, it would be great.

210
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,000
He told a friend from his previous school that he had a girlfriend ?



211
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,470
And out of the blue, that 
friend is coming to visit him.

212
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,830
Yeah.

213
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,630
You're the perfect fit for the
 description he gave his friend, he says.

214
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,550
Do you believe him ?

215
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,010
What do you mean ?

216
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,650
He's totally lying to you.

217
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,390
He's my childhood friend.

218
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,600
That was five years ago.

219
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,470
You should be objective and see what he's like now.

220
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:42,250
I can bet that this friend
 of his won't show up.

221
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,030
I don't want to be
 alone with that guy.

222
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,000
No matter how much I ask ?

223
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,950
There's something 
wrong with you, too.

224
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,800
Why are you obeying him ?

225
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,730
Is he blackmailing you or something ?

226
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,700
I got it.

227
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,930
You'll accept it only when
you're going out with Hiro.

228
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,610
Hide-chan !

229
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,060
That's what it is, isn't it ?

230
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:08,930


231
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,970
What's with that flashy towel ?

232
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,150
Oh, this ?

233
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,900
This is Koga's towel.

234
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,230
As I was resting just now, 
she kindly handed it to me.

235
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,580
I see.

236
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,160
It smells nice.

237
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,590
Kunimi !

238
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,010
Koga, thanks for this.

239
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,370
It's not yours ?

240
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,640
Huh ?

241
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,400
Um...

242
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,170
...that's my towel.

243
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,170
Here.

244
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Here, use this.

245
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,970
Thank you.

246
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,780
Hey, let's run one more lap.

247
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,930
Sure !

248
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,310
Okay !

249
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,760
Wow, it smells nice.

250
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,500

I thought with frustration, when I met you.

269
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,100
"I'm definitely glad we met."

When I'm by myself I notice...

272
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,750
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

273
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,550
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

274
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,700
...there are more and more smiles.

275
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,170
Just by looking at you, see ?

276
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,300
My eyes will look kinder.

Hiro, the Senkawa High School 
Baseball Club finally has a ballpark.

279
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,090
Yeah, we're going to play a game to commemorate its completion.

280
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,960
Which school did you invite ?

281
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,450
Hiryuu West, I hear.

282
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,450
Hiryuu West ?

283
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,430
You mean that school that got barred from official competition because of a brawling incident ?

284
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,460
They look bad-mannered, but...

285
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,600
Right, we shouldn't judge people based on their appearance...
