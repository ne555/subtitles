Repeating seasons...

00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

You can't judge people by how they look.

17
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,750
They may have seemed rough, 
but they were all good guys.

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,750
But he really does seem dangerous.

19
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,740
Sagawa Shuuji. What happened between him and you, Hideo ?

Hikari is in Trouble ! Shuuji's Trap !?

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,660
What's with this dirty hat ?

25
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,590
Don't touch it !

26
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,780
Oh, scary.

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,520
...?

28
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,000
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,270
The phone's ringing.

30
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,550
Hello.

31
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,150
Oh, Hide-chan.

32
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,500
It's me, Shuu.

33
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,730
Oh, hi.

34
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,200
About what I asked 
you the other day...

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,200
Ah, that ? 
To tell the truth...

36
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,180
It's okay. 
Just pretend you didn't hear it.

37
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,400
What ?

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,260
When you think about it, it's stupid.

39
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,660
And I don't want to trouble you.

40
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,780
I'll be honest and tell the truth.

41
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,000
But...

42
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,600
It's fine.

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,800
After all, people at my previous
 school think that I'm a liar anyway.

44
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,900
Bye.

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,020
Wait, Shuu.

46
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,550
Hikari told me.

47
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,050
I don't want to say it, but...

48
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,850
Then don't.

49
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,750
I don't want to hear you say bad
 things about my childhood friend.

50
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,800
Sorry about that.

51
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,800
I've only been a friend of yours since junior high. That's a shallow friendship, I guess.


52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,360
You're my best friend !

53
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,180
The best one I've ever had.

54
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,920
It's amazing that you can say stuff like that without feeling embarrassed.

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,900
So, can you tell me about your childhood friend ?

56
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,090
He had a brother who
 was four years older.

57
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,400
He taught me how to play baseball.

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,750
He was the catcher and cleanup 
hitter on the town's baseball team.

59
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,000
For me, he was the 
star player I felt closest to.

60
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,240
Every day, until the sun went down, he played catch with me and Shuu.

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,450
Does his brother
 still play baseball ?

62
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,280
He died.

63
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,200
When I was in fourth grade...

64
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,600
It's a shame that
 the game got canceled.

65
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,420
There's no way we can
play a game in this weather.

66
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,550
It's a typhoon.

67
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,740
It was raining real 
hard last night, too.

68
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,400
The field is totally soaked.

69
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,710
I wanted to surprise
 those Minami-town guys.

70
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,130
After all, both of you have
 improved so much in half a year.

71
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,300
We're talented, Hide-chan.

72
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,010
Moron, it shows how
 good your coach is.

73
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Tecchan, don't worry about it !
It's dangerous !

74
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,530
I'm fine. 
I can reach it.

75
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,910
See.

76
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,170
Hide-chan, stop by our 
house on the way home.

77
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,540


78
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,050
The three of us can play a game.

79
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,700
Okay.

80
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
We bought a new game.

81
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,700
Wow !

82
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,260
Shuu was so proud of his brother.

83
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,300
If only your hat 
hadn't been blown away.

84
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,900
If only that typhoon hadn't come.

85
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,300
If only it hadn't rained 
so hard the night before.

86
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,600
If only you hadn't played baseball.

87
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,610
If only his mother and father hadn't met.

88
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,530
Or gotten married.

89
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,000
If only, if only.

90
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,280
If only you hadn't been 
born, you wouldn't die.

91
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,800
If we start talking about "ifs and buts"
 after the game is over, there's no end to it.

92
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,090
You want another cup of coffee ?

93
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,100
Yeah.

94
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,870
So that's what it was.

95
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,800
I got what it was, but there's no guarantee 
that the guy is still a good boy after five years.

96
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,140
That's what it is.

97
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,590
Even the lowest, worst criminal could be
 kind of cute when he was in grade school.

98
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,590
He lied to his friend from his previous school that he had a girlfriend ?

99
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,300
That friend is coming to see him now, out of the blue ?

100
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,150
I totally match the description of the girlfriend that he gave his friend ?


101
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,030
Well ? Well ? Well ?

102
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,720
Anyway, why don't you help Hideo out here this time ?

103
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,030
Don't worry. I'll disguise 
myself and watch over you.

104
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,490
If he does anything weird,
 I'll jump out and rescue you.

105
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,340
He seems tough.

106
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,850
I know.

107
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,500
I'll try not to lose consciousness until after you've escaped.

108
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,290


109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,780
Besides, you're really conceited to think
 that he's going to do something to you.

110
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, that's what you told me.

111
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,490
You said I'm an attractive woman who makes men's hearts throb.

112
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,900
Um, anyway...

113
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,630
...it's not nice to judge people by their appearance or first impressions, you know ?

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,420
If you take the time and talk to them, sometimes they turn out to be good people.

115
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,760
Really ?

116
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
Just sometimes...

117
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,780
What ? Oh, really.

118
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,390
Thanks, Hide-chan.

119
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,250
Yeah, I got it.

120
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,650
Sagawa

121
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,650
Bye.

122
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,430
Oh, my. You caught cold 
or something, Hide-chan ?

123
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,400
EYECATCH

124
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,290
Are you a destitute manga artist or something ?

125
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,000
...

126
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Did you wait for long ?

127
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,880
Not really. I would have been
 perfectly fine if you hadn't come.

128
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,500
Let's go, then.

129
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,610
To where ?

130
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,950
Where my friend is waiting for us.

131
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,560
It's not here ?

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,390
I'm counting on you, buddy.

133
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,500
Ku

134
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,000
Kuni

135
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,400
Kunimi.

136
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,400
I knew it ! It's Kunimi !

137
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,390
You must be mistaking
me for someone else.

138
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,200
It's too obvious and 
unfashionable, moron.

139
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,580
What's with this outfit ? 
You're making me laugh !

140
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,200
I don't want to hear that from you, of all people.

141
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,700
Listen.

142
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,430
What ?

143
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,580
If you don't shut up and leave...

144
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,200
What if I don't leave ?

145
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Hmm...let's see...

146
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,800
I'm going to...

147
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,650
I'm going to tell people that you 
poked a hole in our clubhouse...

148
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,200
...and tried to peep into the women's track team clubhouse next door.

149
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What ? How did
 you know my plan ?

150
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,300
I can see through 
everything you're thinking.

151
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,720
Just go away.

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,340
Okay, sorry to intrude.

153
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,510
Damn. That was what 
I was thinking of doing.

154
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,500
Well, the guy with the cold must be following them.

155
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,090
But still...

156
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,150
 Today's High Score

157
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,150
I... I give up !

158
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,150
I can still take it !

159
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,150
Come back yesterday !

160
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,950
It's a shame that I
 couldn't show off this punch.

161
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,560
Hmm...

162
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,020
We're not there yet ?

163
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,900
Almost.

164
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,800
Couldn't we have 
met up back there ?

165
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,700
He's coming to this
 town for the first time.

166
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,700
I had him come to a place that's easy to find, so that he wouldn't get lost.

167
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,810
Oh.

168
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,100
What are you doing ?

169
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,600
Nothing.

170
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,240
Oh, Hide-chan.
 Long time no see.

171
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,060
Yes, it's been a while.

172
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,380
Your recent performance was amazing. You've made newspaper headlines.

173
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,680
Well...

174
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,960
You really have grown. You were playing around here back when...

175
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,900
Five years ago.

176
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,800
And now, you're a superstar.

177
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,930
This way ! This way !

178
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,740
Tecchan, come over here !

179
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,450
Hurry !

180
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,800
How many ?

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,450
Um, well, I'll leave it up to you.

182
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,450
Oh, I'm talking about your homeruns. How many have you hit already ?

183
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,470
Ah, well...

184
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,690
Hey, this is where we're
 meeting up with your friend ?

185
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,110
Yeah.

186
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,320
You can see these three
 chimneys from anywhere, right ?

187
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,730
But these factory ruins are creepy.

188
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,470
I didn't know.

189
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,030
This wasn't ruins five years ago.

190
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,950
Ifs and buts...

191
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,960
Tecchan, was it a good game ?

192
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,200
Tecchan is amazing.

193
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,500
It's an elementary school baseball game, but he's working hard.

194
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,200
Hide, focus and wait
 for the right pitch !

195
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,150
You've got to match my brother's intensity ! 
Show your mettle ! Hit a walk-off !

196
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,940
Yeah !

197
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,990
Hide, don't dwell on it just
 because you couldn't get a hit.

198
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,110
But I'm so frustrated...!

199
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,990
You tried your best.
 And that's good enough.

200
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,290
But if only I had gotten a hit...

201
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,600
Hide, don't say "ifs and buts."

202
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,320
Okay ? No "ifs and buts."

203
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,100
Tecchan...

204
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,650
Tecchan...

205
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,560
Why don't you come 
over here and sit down ?

206
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,760
No thank you.

207
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,050
Oh, okay.

208
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,550
But really, I'm jealous.

209
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,400
I'm talking about Hide-chan.

210
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,650
He's become a star high school baseball player as a first year.

211
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,650
He has all the attention, and 
people expect big things from him.

212
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,700
He's surrounded by
 newspaper reporters and fans.

213
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,460
And on top of that, he has a beautiful girlfriend like you.

214
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,990
This world is so unfair.

215
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,300
If he has things people 
would be envious of...

216
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,750
If he has so many things 
people would be envious of...

217
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,450
...it means he's worked
 so hard to attain those.

218
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,660
I'm fortunate that I'm
 a childhood friend of his.

219
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,520
You're not listening to me, are you ?

220
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,530
That famous guy listens to anything and everything I ask of him.

221
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,000
He buys me meals. 
He lends me money.

222
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,130
And today...

223
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,960
...I get to borrow his girlfriend.

224
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,000
He really is charitable.

225
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I guess he's being respectful of my dead brother.

226
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,400
If you come any closer,
 I'm going to scream.

227
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,090
So a cockroach is going to 
come flying again or something ?

228
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,400
T...that's right.

229
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,170
The cockroaches around
 here are pretty big.

230
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,110
...

231
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,000
What kind of taste do you have ?

232
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,700
Shut up. It was half hidden,
 so I thought it was a penguin.

233
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,900
That's right. 
It's easy to mix them up.

234
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Yesterday, I found 
one in the kitchen...

235
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,760
...

236
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,600
What are you doing here ?

237
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,000
What about you ? 
Weren't you watching Hikari ?

238
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,130
I wasn't worried because
 I thought you were watching her.

239
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,930
Dammit !

240
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,550
Hiro !

241
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,000
What is it ?

242
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,560


243
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,890
He's here.

244
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,040
Hm ?

245
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,280
Well, there's no need to worry.

246
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,150
So you really trust him.

247
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,790
I trust him.
 He's my childhood friend.

248
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,450
If you trusted him, you wouldn't be stalking him in disguise.

249
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,090
I guess something like that 
may have happened in the past.

250
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,560
Let bygones be bygones ?

251
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm thankful that I got to
 know Tecchan, and you, too.

252
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,960
And him, too. He'd often get
 misunderstood, but the truth is...

253
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,850
We've got to look for her !

Like you, I run up the pedestrian bridge...

262
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:34,480
Notes:
If you must know the porn mag's title: "Sexy Sunday"

The phrase, "come back yesterday !" is a common one that means something along the line of "don't bother coming back."

263
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,450
...keeping up with the sunny sky, I want to feel courageous.

264
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,310
Notes:
 Graffiti is nothing important but: "Explosive Run !" "Idiots !"
 "Go get them !"

Doll tag Hiro caught: "Mr. Cockroach"

 Board in old factory: the character that's on the board is "Yasu" or "An" and it can mean "cheap," but it's probably a part of a name or a word. Maybe it's "Safety" ["anzen"]

265
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,170
"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:55,800
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

272
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,100
"I'm definitely glad we met."

273
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,920
Let's stay strong and move forward.

274
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,650
When I'm by myself I notice...

275
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,600
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

276
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,400
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

277
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,650
...there are more and more smiles.

278
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,100
Just by looking at you, see ?

279
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,200
My eyes will look kinder.

280
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,600
Hiro, you said you'd watch over me.

281
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
It's Hideo's fault. 
He was taking his time.

282
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,930
Next episode of H2 is,
 "Hikari's Lie, Hiro's Tears."

283

Hikari's Lie, Hiro's Tears

286
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,350
Look forward to it !

287
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,320
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
