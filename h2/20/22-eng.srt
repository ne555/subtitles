2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,910
I'm Kunimi Hiro, a first year pitcher with Senkawa High School's baseball club.

13
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,750
I'm a close friend of Tachibana Hideo, the cleanup hitter for Meiwa.

14
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,060
He asked me to pinch-hit on 
his date, and I couldn't say no.

15
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,100
The date is with Hikari,
 my childhood friend.

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,550
I've known her
since we were little...

17
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,160
...so there shouldn't be any reason for me to feel nervous, but...

18
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,820


19
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:09,080

 Episode 22

21
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:09,080
Pinch-Hitting for a Date: 
The Couple is Unable to Return Home

22
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,150
Mr. Madison's Bridge

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,340
Nontenora

24
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:32,650
Red Broncross

25
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,240
Hey...

26
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,400
Oh, no...

27
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,020
Dummy.

28
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,020
Oh, you weren't on the train ?

29
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,360
Nope.
 I figured this would happen.

30
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
You've always done things
like this since you were little.

31
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,400
Here.

32
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,310
Thanks.

33
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,960
This flavor brings back memories.

34
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,820
I thought so.

35
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,150
We haven't gone out together in a while.

36
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,470
Really ?

37
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,270
Well.

38
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,400
Let's go.

39
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,050
Yeah.

40
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,840
Thank you so much.

41
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,790
No problem.

42
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,840
What is it ?

43
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,020
Nothing.

44
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,650
What is it ? It bugs me.

45
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,730
It bothers you ?

46
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,550
Yeah.

47
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,040
I just thought, "Until recently, you
couldn't even reach the strap handle."

48
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,900
Oh, that ?

49
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
Didn't I tell you ?

50
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,190
I have big hands and feet,
so I'll definitely grow bigger.

51
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,320
You've certainly grown.

52
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,140
Here, please have one.

53
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,950
Thank you.

54
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:42,100
When I'm needed by someone...

55
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,950
...I learn for the first time where I am right now.

56
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:56,600
Just as the metronome gets interrupted...

57
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:04,560
...so few people can hear the monotonous sound.

58
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,480
With a clunk, I place my forehead on the display window.

59
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:22,030
For what can I cry ? I look up beyond the sky.

60
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,840
When you're not with me, you overflow.

61
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:38,030
On the streets and by the windows, the clues overflow.

62
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:46,310
Loneliness doesn't corner us.

63
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:54,530
Rather, it teaches us whom we cannot lose.

64
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:20,100
Even those long, difficult nights that make us retreat...

65
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:30,380
...we'll be able to laugh about someday, like a childhood scar.

66
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:41,900
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

67
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:50,170
...rather than losing our time to regret.

68
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:58,300
Happiness is not something that someone does for me.

69
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:06,950
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

70
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,040
Hey.

71
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
Huh ?

72
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,100
Was the can of juice tasty ?

73
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,350
Thanks for that.

74
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,260
You know him ?

75
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,270
Kind of.

76
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,000
I got to know him 
about three hours ago.

77
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,450
Shin-Tokoroguchiko Station

78
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,150
Service suspended between
Shirai and Mikami,
due to flooding on the tracks. 
Thank you for your patience.

79
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,700
Man, it was amazing.

80
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,560
Because of the sudden rainstorm, the concert was cut short.

81
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,800
Girls' underwear was showing through, and train service is stopped.

82
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,700
Really, we've got to have more 
outdoor concerts during summer.

83
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,300
I told you so.

84
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,900
Yeah.

85
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,000
It's 8:30.

86
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,650
Do you think this is that 
well-known course of events...

87
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,190
...where the couple who can't go
home and spend the night together ?

88
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm very sorry.

89
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,600
In half an hour or so, they say that train service will resume.

90
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,900
Okay.

91
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,350
Let's go spend some time
at the cafÃ© near the station.

92
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,100
Run !

93
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,640
EYECATCH

94
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,600
What kind of things do you 
usually talk about with Hideo ?

95
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
You want to know ?

96
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,790
I'm curious.

97
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,850
I see.

98
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,230
About social service, environmental issues...

99
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,000
...taxes...

100
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,800
And about our dreams
for the future, I guess.

101
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,840
Dreams ?

102
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,450
What's Hideo's dream for the future ?

103
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,170
First, the Koushien.

104
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,090
Then professional ball.

105
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,050
Rookie of the Year. 
All-Star appearance.

106
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,300
Individual titles.
The team winning the championship.

107
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,310
Breaking several records, and retiring afterward.

108
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,040
Become a commentator 
and then a field manager.

109
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,700
And three children in
a heartwarming home.

110
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,300
And you're the wife.

111
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,010
He didn't say that part.

112
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,030
There's no need to even hear it.

113
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,190
You want to become a pro, too ?

114
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,220
I wonder.

115
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,090
Playing baseball for
a living sounds tough.

116
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,100
Well, I'm sure I'll play baseball until I can't move anymore.

117
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,120
But it can be bush-league or anything, in my case.

118
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,060
I suppose.

119
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,320
I always want you to
play baseball for fun.

120
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,940
So ?

121
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,000
Hm ?

122
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,200
What's your dream ?

123
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,600
The perfect crime and political reform.

124
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,900
Oh, the rain seems to have stopped.

125
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,400
I do want to get married.

126
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,650
But before that, I want to find a 
job where I can feel confident.

127
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:39,650
And become an independent adult who has her own perspective.

128
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,530
So you want to become a
"career-focused woman" ?

129
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,250
I don't mean something grand like that.

130
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,870
But at least, I don't want to live 
my life just following my partner.

131
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,220
So I don't really mind if my husband is a professional baseball player...

132
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,300
...or an ace pitcher for the
neighborhood baseball league...

133
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Oops.

134
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,580
What do you mean, "oops" ?

135
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,120
Well, the trains seem
to be running. Let's go.

136
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,610
Thank you.

137
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,700
What are you doing ? We'll be late.

138
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Yeah.

139
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,900
Well, I guess we avoided trouble.

140
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,350
What do you mean ?

141
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,320
If we couldn't go home and had to spend
the night together, Hideo would beat me up.

142
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,770
Why ?

143
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,950
Why ? It's a given !

144
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,170
A man and a woman
spending the night together...

145
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,430
 What could possibly happen between you and me ?

146
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,300
Oh, you sound confident.

147
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,700
It's a given.

148
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,550
It's strange.
I wonder where it went.

149
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,000
Um...

150
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,050
There's no ring here.

151
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,650
You shouldn't make
such a hasty conclusion.

152
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,200
I can't find it.

153
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,910
Really, I wonder where it went.

154
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,230
Shall we give up ? Okay ?

155
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,020
No ! Look for it !

156
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,140
Okay ?

157
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,600
That's right.
 It's an engagement ring.

158
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,650
Yes, that's right, Miss !

159
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,310
Oh, it's Hikari, right ?
You're definitely right !

160
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,210
You must be happy to 
have such a great girlfriend.

161
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry I'm such a bad girlfriend !

162
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,250
I didn't mean it like that.

163
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,500
I mean, it's your fault, Lacchie !

164
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,000
It's your fault for proposing to me in a place like this !

165
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,900
I wanted to put it on your finger after the concert !

166
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,550
Well, you shouldn't fight, Lacchie.

167
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,100
That's right. You'll find it.

168
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,000
Really...?

169
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,440
Can it be found...?

170
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,550
We will find it.

171
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,000
It's here !

172
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,010
Really ?

173
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,200
Thank goodness !

174
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,430
This is...

175
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,250
Yeah.

176
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,000
Right now, it's still a glass ring, but someday, I'll give you the real ring.

177
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,900
A shiny one. So have faith in me, and stay with me.

178
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,290
I guess they're shining.

179
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,720
Yeah, it's shiny.

180
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,050
Right ?

181
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,850
Hikari.

182
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,650
Huh ?

183
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,900
Hurry up, or we'll
be late for the train.

184
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,030
Yeah, let's go.

185
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,950
By the time we get home, it'll be midnight.

186
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,170
Thanks for that.

187
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,800
Leave them alone !
We don't have time !

188
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,930
Yeah...

189
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,750
Hikari.

190
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
Hikari !

191
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,300
Darling, I can't hold it anymore !

192
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,440
The baby's coming out !
 He's coming out !

193
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,410
Are you okay ? Hang in there !

194
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,660
We're definitely not helping them.

195
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,170
Darling, I can't hold it anymore !

196
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,600
Hang in there ! I'll take you to the hospital right way !

197
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,970
Dammit !

198
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,400
The baby's coming out...!

"Up-bound" train service
has ended for today.

201
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,100
Well then...

202
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,360
I'm glad that couple made it in time.

203
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,340
Yeah.

Well then, what are we
going to do, "Big Sister" ?

...that I can hold forever as I walk.

213
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:31,480
Notes:
Movie Titles: Nontenora - is probably Cinderella.  Red Broncross - is probably Rumble in the Bronx. Or "Red Bronx" as it was also called.

Train service sign meaning: "Up-bound" means 
"bound for Tokyo area."

214
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:34,380
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

215
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,310
Notes:


216
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:42,230
...rather than the footsteps that


 sound further and further away.

Central Anime(Kansas)
Production
Version 1.0

222
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,830
The star I'm watching today...

223
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,310
...glistened yesterday.

224
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,930
In the town full of things that disappear...

225
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,060
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

226
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:08,010
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

227
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:16,160
...rather than losing our time to regret.

228
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,560
Happiness is not something...

229
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,390
...that someone does for me.

230
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:32,960
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

231
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,890
Oh well, in the end, 
we couldn't go home.

232
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,540
But I feel safe with Hiro.

233
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,930
What do you mean by that ?

234
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,210
I mean, we're like siblings.

235
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,010
You don't understand. You're an attractive woman who makes men's hearts throb.

236
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,460
Is that what you say ?

237
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,270
Well, I might, or might not.

238
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,650
Oh, Hiro is going to turn into a wolf !

239
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,670
Next episode of H2 is, "I Can't Sleep... A Night With Just the Two of Us."

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,700
Look forward to it !

244

Are you having a refreshing workout ?
