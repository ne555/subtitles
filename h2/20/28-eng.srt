00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

15

16
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,820
Hideo's childhood friend, Sagawa Shuuji.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,690
He bothers me, but I have
other things to take care of.

18
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,910
Our ballpark is finally completed.

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,650
 Episode 28

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,650
A Commemorative Game !

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,650
Dangerous Guys Are Coming

22
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:08,300


23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,850
It's looking more and
 more like a ballpark.

24
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,000
We'll finally be able to use our
 ballpark starting next week, right ?

25
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,510
Our ballpark...!

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,800
Private School - Senkawa High School

27
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,060
Guys, we have our opponent for
the ballpark commemoration game.

28
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,320
Which team is it, Captain ?

29
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,430
It's a team that made it to the quarterfinals in the summer tournament last year.

30
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,970
Oh, I'm surprised that a good team like that has accepted to play us.

31
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,700
So which one is it ?

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,940
Hiryuu West.

33
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,990
What ?!

34
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,910
What the heck ?!

35
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,650
It's supposed to be the memorable first game for our baseball team.

36
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,500
 But of all the teams, 
Hiryuu West is our opponent ?

37
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,680
Is there a problem ?

38
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
You don't know ?

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,700
They're a violent team that was barred for a year for an in-game brawling incident.

40
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,540
That suspension just ended recently.

41
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,400
Apparently, they've been
 looking for a practice partner...

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,450
...but haven't been able to find one, and they've been in need of help.

43
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,000
Of course ! 
Hiryuu West is notoriously bad !

44
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,120
I hear they bean people like crazy.

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,500
Wasn't the reason for the brawl also because of a bean ball ?

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,260
That's right. They hit somebody, and yet
 they got mad when someone complained.

47
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,640
I might get a fever
 and miss the game...

48
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,070
You shouldn't judge 
people by a rumor.

49
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,310
I guess, but...

50
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,910
They did actually
 get suspended, after all.

51
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,730
No, there are no bad 
people who play baseball.

52
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,570
But...

53
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,150
Yeah...

54
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,490
Don't worry.

55
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,430
I have a plan, just in case. You shouldn't worry.

56
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,320
That's all.


57
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,430
He doesn't seem like an ordinary guy.

58
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,310
Right.

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,050
He disappears without 
watching us practice.

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,050
Senkawa High School
Baseball Club Ballpark,
Completion Commemoration Game

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,900
Baseball Club

63
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,560
Today, it doesn't matter
 if we win or lose.

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,500
First, play an actual game, and 
identify the areas of improvement.

65
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,710
The opponent made it to 
the quarterfinals last year.

66
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,770
It's a suitable opponent for
 gauging where we are right now.

67
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's see how good the Senkawa High School Baseball Club is.

68
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,320
That's what the principal said.

69
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,400
He definitely isn't an ordinary guy.

70
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,270
Right.

71
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
Let's go.

72
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,820
Yes, sir !

73
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,600
Ah !

74
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,210
Huh ?

75
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,530
I forgot.

76
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,090
Dammit. They shouldn't be treating their main slugger this way.

77
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,090
Give me a break.

78
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,190
Hey, baseball club guy.

79
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,250
What ?!

80
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,040
Captain, they're here.

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,840
Yeah...

82
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,390
Here it is. This is the 
place you're looking for...

83
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,710
Man, they're far scarier than I thought...

84
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,170
Father, Mother, please forgive me for dying before you...

85
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,590
What are you babbling about ?

86
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,610
We shouldn't judge people by
 their appearance. Right, Kunimi ?

87
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,400
Yeah.

88
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,660
But if we meet them on the street, 
maybe we shouldn't make eye contact.

89
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm Yokomichi, the
 coach for Hiryuu West.

90
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Thank you for inviting us today.

91
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,650
I'm Koga, the coach here.

92
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,550
You may have heard many rumors...

93
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,100
...but they've learned from their 
mistakes, so please be don't worry.

94
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,900
Old geezer, can we start practicing ?

95
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,340
Can we do some pre-game practice ?

96
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,330
Please.

97
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,700
Then let us borrow
 the field for a while.

98
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,330
The old geezer says we can start.

99
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,120
It's important to properly 
maintain your equipment.

100
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,950
Both teams, line up !

101
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,270
You're pitching ?

102
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,220


103
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,070
You're pitching ?

104
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,210
Yes, that's right.

105
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,200
If you're not confident that you can locate your pitches, don't aim for tight spots.

106
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,700
I'm a calm guy...

107
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,380
...but we have many short-tempered guys on our team.

108
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,800
Even if it just scrapes the 
uniform, you might see blood.

109
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,800
Sure. I'll throw everything
 right down the middle today.

110
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,900
Hey, hey. I'm not 
threatening you or anything.

111
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,750
Team

112
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,750
Hiryuu West

113
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,750
Senkawa

114
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,750
2

115
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,750
1

116
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,570
Play ball !

117
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,190
Yeah.

118
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,640
Strike ! Batter out !

119
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,360
He really threw everything right down the middle.

120
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,630
I guess he's really 
underestimating us.

121
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,940
Yeah ! Let's crush them !

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,010
We can't fool around
 against a newborn team !

123
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,050
Yeah !

124
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Go get them !

125
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,200
Hit them !

126
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,660
Out !

127
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,800
Are you all right, Yanagi ?

128
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,200
They didn't slide into you ?

129
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,200
Um, no.

130
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,300
But really, that guy 
was going after his leg.

131
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,550
Definitely.

132
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,390
That was a routine play.

133
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,500
It's an aggressive play to break up the double play.

134
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,270
Hit by pitch.

135
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,850
Any pitcher can hit
 a batter sometimes.

136
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,400
EYECATCH

137
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,560
Out !

138
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,730
Good job !

139
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,000
This is awful.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,500
They say that 
baseball is a combat sport.

141
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,440
But what if they get injured ?

142
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,470
You said there are no bad people who play baseball.

143
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,000
That's...right, but...

144
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,690
Then you should trust your own words.

145
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,280
Out !

146
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,600
I had no doubt that he
 would slide into Noda.

147
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,900
He wanted an out, 
so he blocked the plate.

148
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,030
He didn't want to make
 an out, so he slid around.

149
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,300
That's all.

150
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,090
It's a routine defensive play, 
and a routine base running play.

151
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,090
Baseball is a combat sport...

152
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,170


153
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,790
I'm sorry !

154
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,380
Thanks...

155
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Nice effort.

156
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,810
Strike !

157
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry. The ball got away 
from me because of the sweat.

158
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,050
I wonder about that.

159
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,390
Wasn't it a retaliation for 
what happened earlier ?

160
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,540
No, it really was the sweat.

161
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,180
How can we 
believe you scumbags ?

162
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,750
Are you saying it was intentional ?
 Don't look down on us !

163
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,660
Hit by pitch.

164
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,400
Don't get rattled ! It just
 scraped the uniform a little bit.

165
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,310
Watch out, Kunimi.

166
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,910
I don't want to say this, but they might retaliate.

167
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,800
Senior...

168
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,150
...your zipper's open.

169
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,400
...?

170
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,870
There's no need to worry.

171
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,100
There are no bad 
people who play baseball.

172
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,330
I believe that, too.

173
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,700
That's right.

174
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,030
Ball.

175
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,330
Damn. He hit my 
best pitch so easily.

176
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,050
You thought he'd 
retaliate, didn't you ?

177
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,000
Huh ?

178
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,600
You've still got a ways to go.

179
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,550
I said there are no bad 
people who play baseball.


180
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,800
Oh.

181
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,680
Strike !

182
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,600
Yeah !

183
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,940
Can I ask you a question ?

184
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,020
What is it ?

185
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,260
What was the "plan"
 you had just in case ?

186
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,400
There's no need for that now.

187
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,580
Yes, but just for
 reference, what was it ?

188
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,730
It was just a bluff.

189
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,520
What ?

190
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,830
Did you actually play baseball 
when you were in high school ?

191
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,030
I was definitely in the baseball club.

192
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,940
I didn't get to play in a game even once in those three years, though.

193
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,000
The coach thoroughly hated me.

194
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,200
He was an absurd dictator coach.

195
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,080
I never understood a
 thing he was telling us.

196
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,650
Does that sound like sour grapes ?

197
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,280
Not really.

198
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:11,480
In those three years, I kept thinking in the dugout about what I'd do if I were the coach.

199
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,300
Come to think of it...

200
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,070
...I probably held a desire since then to become a high school baseball coach.

201
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,570
Strike !

202
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,700
I'm happy that your
 dream has been realized.

203
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,480
Yeah.

204
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,940
Wow...!

205
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,390
Out ! Game set !

206
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,840
Did you see my super play ?!

207
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,170
Nice.

208
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,670
I'm impressed that you 
squared up and hit that pitch.

209
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,230
A pitch inside, and then a pitch away. That's playing it by the book.

210
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,360
Sometimes, the ball 
slips away, though.

211
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,340
Well, I guess I'll let
 you off the hook today.

212
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Hiryuu West

213
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,600
Huh ?

214
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,000
How did you like playing a
 game for the first time in a year ?

215
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,850
Don't ask me something
 that goes without saying.

216
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's go back and 
start practicing, then.

217
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,160
What ? Now ?

218
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,760


219
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,900
Hey, geezer ! What kind of 
crap are you talking about ?

220
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,790
We shouldn't judge people by rumors or appearances.

221
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,910
I guess so.

222
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,220
Even then, scary people are scary.

223
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,270
By the way, 
who's driving that bus ?

224
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,800
Senkawa High School

225

Hiryuu West
Has Been Here

226
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,470
So, did this give 
you any information ?

227
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,280
They're good...!

228
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,590
I had no idea. 
Our team is this good ?

229
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,910
You said it didn't 
matter if we won or lost.

230
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,200
Our opponent was last year's quarterfinalist, you know ?

231
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,120
They were on a year-long hiatus.

232
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,560
From the fifth inning or so, their legs were getting tired from the lack of training.

233
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,970
I can see the Koushien, Haruka !

234
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,030
There.

235
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,700
You have an extreme weakness for the Koushien, right ?

236
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
That's good !

237
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,120
He's no ordinary guy.

238
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,220


239
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,690
Now, let's clean up our ballpark !

240
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,020
Yeah !

Notes:
The red writing by Hiryuu West: This "has been here" message is often used by biker gangs and stuff.

250
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:42,500
...keeping up with the sunny sky, I want to feel courageous.

251
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:43,360
Notes:
 Haruka's joke at the end to her brother: This is probably an irony. The phrase, to "have an extreme weakness for" something literally means "have no eyes for" something. And the coach's eyes, when Haruka takes the sunglasses off, are very tiny.

252
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,220
"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:57,850
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

259
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,150
"I'm definitely glad we met."

260
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,970
Let's stay strong and move forward.

261
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,700
When I'm by myself I notice...

262
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,650
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

263
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,450
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

264
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,700
...there are more and more smiles.

265
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,150
Just by looking at you, see ?

266
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,300
My eyes will look kinder.

Next Episode

268
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,820
I know that we shouldn't judge
 people by their appearance, but...

269
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,000
Hideo's childhood friend,
 Sagawa Shuuji, definitely looks fishy.

270
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,670
Yeah, I wonder if Hide-chan is being blackmailed by him.

271
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,200
I wonder what
 happened in Hideo's past.

272
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,360
There must be something wrong with Hide-chan, to ask me to go on a date with him.

273
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,430
But you can't turn down Hideo's request, right ?

274
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,750
Next episode of H2 is,
 "Hikari is in Trouble ! Shuuji's Trap !?"

275
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,300
A Memorial Game !

276
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,300
Next episode of H2 is

277
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,300
Hikari is in Trouble ! Shuuji's Trap !?

278
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,300
Look forward to it !

279
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,000
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
