00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,450
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,750
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,750
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,850
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,900
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,400
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,870
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,500
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,700
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:52,300
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,200
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,750
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,060
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,550
...to this big, endless dream.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,400
After this and that, we have a coach.

17
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,100
Baseball Club

18
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,100
And Senkawa High School 
Baseball Club has been launched.

19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,020
But we only made it this far because our seniors started the baseball fan club.

20
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,200
I Can't Sleep...

21
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,200

00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,200
Farewell, Seniors ! A Tearful Send-Off Game

23
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,640


24
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,800
Baseball Club

25
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,990
This really is a club room.

26
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,700
Yeah. It's definitely a club room.

27
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,000
It's definitely a club room.

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,840
I can't forget the time we marched into the principal's office, just the two of us.

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeah. We were really surprised.

30
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,150
You really want to play baseball ?

31
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,250
Um, yes. Please let us.

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,490
Okay, then.

33
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,650
I will gladly fill out
 your transfer request.

34
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,350
Which school would
 you like to transfer to ?

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,420
What ? No !

36
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,460
Please wait.
 We just wanted to...

37
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,800
If you want to play baseball, 
you should attend another school.

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,710
I hate baseball.

39
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,990
So it ended up being
 The Baseball Fan Club.

40
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,150
And now it's been upgraded to an actual baseball club.

41
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,350
Moreover, with a club room.

42
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,450
Yeah.

43
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,660
If this had happened a year earlier, we could have used this room, too.

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
The exclusive practice field, too.

45
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,550
Senior Yamaguchi, Senior Nemoto.

46
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,390
Hi, Manager.

47
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,000
Come on in.

48
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,050
If you have time, can
 you watch us practice ?

49
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,030
Hey, are you trying to tempt students
 prepping for college entrance exams ?

50
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,620
Our grades are a little 
below average, you know ?

51
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,840
I don't want to spend a year 
prepping for the exam again.

52
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,960
That's right.

53
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,870
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight...

54
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,890
A send-off game ?

55
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:31,130
We have this baseball club only 
because our seniors started the fan club.

56
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,720
See ? We should share
 our enjoyment with them.

57
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,950
So, a send-off game ?

58
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,640
Yeah, that's a great idea.

59
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,500
It would've been nice to use
 this field to play that game, but...

60
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,650
Okay, let's do it.

61
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,780
As the new captain, I was thinking we'd want to do something for them, too.

62
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,300
Even if we use another ballpark, the seniors will surely be happy.

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,890


64
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,810
Look. Your ballpark will soon 
be born with a baby's first cry.

65
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,730


66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,550
Hey.

67
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,250
So how did it go ?

68
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,200
I was able to reserve a ballpark...

69
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,900
...but I'm having a hard time
 finding a team to play us.

70
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,600
Good luck, 
Kunimi Hiro !

71
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,550
You know, lots of teams are
 preparing for the fall tournament.

72
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,300
That's true.

73
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,150
So I want to ask the
 Greengrocer Kuma's team.

74
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,050
I see.
 The shopping-street team, huh ?

75
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,800
Come to think of it, the seniors used to play games with them.

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,590
A send-off game.

77
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,350
Private School - Senkawa High School

78
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,330
Wow, that's great !

79
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,460
About the date, will next Sunday work for you ?

80
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,000
If we wait too long, you
might be busy studying.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,300
Is that okay with you ?

82
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,480
Yeah, it works for me.

83
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,100
Me, too.

84
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I'm relieved. We started to set the date before asking you.

85
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,650
So I was worried that things
 might not work out.

86
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,630
Don't worry about such a thing.

87
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,750
You're the captain of the baseball club,
not the fan club. You should feel confident.

88
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,720
O...okay !

89
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,980
Then, please excuse us.

90
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,010
The mock exam is
 on Sunday, too, isn't it ?

91
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,200
Well, that's just one of them.

92
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,050
If we pass, we pass. 
If we fail, we fail.

93
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,200
I guess you're right.

94
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,300
For exams, all you need is 
to hit a homerun in the end.

95
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,300
Wow, you talk big !

96
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,650
Central Park Baseball Field

97
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,000
Greengrocer Kuma

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,050

Suehiro Meat Shop

100
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,650
Send-Off Game for the Seniors
Shopping Street Team x Senkawa High School Baseball Club

101
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,440
It makes me blush a bit.

102
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,400
Me, too.

103
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,200
It shouldn't be that way.

104
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,350
You will be the first alums of our
 glorious Senkawa Baseball Club.

105
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,680
You definitely deserve this.

106
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,030
The first alums...

107
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,550
We'll probably be treated as fossils or antiques one day.

108
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,680
Oh, here.

109
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,710
That's a ball you used to 
use until just recently, right ?

110
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,490
Yeah.

111
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,230
They're kind of like our lucky charms.

112
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,760
This is our last game, so I was hoping to get at least one hit.

113
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,050
Hey !

114
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,400
Hello.

115
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,980
We hear this is the send-off game for Yamaguchi and Nemoto.

116
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes, it is.

117
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,170
Regardless, we're not going to go easy on you. So you should be prepared.

118
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,200
After all, our match record is 4 wins and 4 losses so far.

119
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,150
If we lose the series as you graduate...

120
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,480
...it'll be an embarrassment
 to us, the Shopping Street Team.

121
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,090
Right, Ken ?

122
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,650
Yeah.

123
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,310
Then, can you do the usual ?

124
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,830
Okay, got it.

125
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,650
Well, this is the send-off game, so I'll give you a special deal.

126
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,000
If you win, I'll give you a big serving
 of the usual ramen, plus pot-stickers.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,900
Wow !

128
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,430
Hey, you first year over there.

129
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,170
You're going to lose anyway. You
shouldn't be celebrating ahead of time.


130
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,660
Oh, you sure talk big.

131
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,710
But we're not the 
same as we used to be.

132
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,870
After all, we're the newborn
 Senkawa High School Baseball Club.

133
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,320
It's just a name 
change from the fan club.

134
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,160
You don't even have a coach.

135
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,680
We actually have a coach now.

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,870
He can't be here today.

137
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,830
Moron !

138
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,870
A coach who doesn't attend games should be fired !

139
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,050
That's right !

140
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,760
Hm ?

141
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,500
Hey.

142
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,110
D...Dad ?

143
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,000
Mr. Kunimi...

144
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000

145
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000

Senkawa High School Baseball Club

147
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,460
Oh no...

148
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,480
Sorry about that.

149
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,990
It's been a while, 
so it can't be helped.

150
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,050
I don't even know if
 I can throw strikes, either.

151
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,450
All right, let's relax.

152
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,900
Send-Off Game for the Seniors
Shopping Street Team x Senkawa High School Baseball Club

153
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,660
Let's do it !

154
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,430
Yeah !

155
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,460
Play ball !

156
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,640
A great pitch to hit !

157
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,250
Out.

158
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,000
Senior Yamaguchi, nice pitch !

159
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,180
Oh !

160
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,990
Safe !

161
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,630


162
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,920
Don't worry.

163
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,800
Sure...

164
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,270
Yeah !

165
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,360
A bomb right out of the gate.

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,980
It's not unusual in the first inning.

167
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,580
But really, he hit a
 rubber ball that far ?

168
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,000
He may not look the part, but
 Mr. Kuma actually went to the Koushien.

169
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,960
The Koushien...?

170
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,860
Oh boy.

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,500
Team

172
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,500

Senkawa High School Baseball Club

174
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,500
What ? My father is the starting pitcher ?

175
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,880
Oh, come on...

176
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,450
Are you serious ?

177
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,350
You know, I'm the first one to teach Hiro baseball.

178
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,270
Wow...

179
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,290
Is that true, Kunimi ?

180
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,680
Usually, a kid's first catch
partner is their father, right ?

181
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,310
I see.

182
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,960
Just leave it to me !

183
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,610
EYECATCH

184
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,270
I predict a homerun !

185
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,710
That won't happen. I'm going to strike you out in three pitches.

186
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,020
Here I come. 
Take this Kunimi Ball Tarou Number 1 !

187
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,250


188
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,250
Hit by pitch.

189
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,650
Man. That was a miracle pitch ?

190
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,560
Oh, sorry about that.

191
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,940
Ouch...

192
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,830
Oh no...

193
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,890
Ball four.

194
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,590
I'm not great at the
start of the game.

195
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,700
Senior Yamaguchi, you've got a scoring opportunity !

196
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,460
 This is your last game.
 Try to square up and hit.

197
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,760
Here you go with your
 "whisper talk tactics."

198
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,460


199
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,550
This time, I'll get it done.
Kunimi Ball Tarou Number 2 !

200
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,050
Got it !

201
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,690
Out.

202
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,440
Yes !

203
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,950
Tough luck.

204
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,490
I timed it just right...

205
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,750
Good luck, Senior Nemoto.

206
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,880
We've been waiting 
for you, cleanup batter.

207
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,290
Now, will Mr. Nemoto be able to live up
 to expectations as the cleanup hitter ?

208
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,540
I'm not going to fall for your tactics.

209
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,650
Here comes Kunimi Ball Tarou Number 3.

210
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,970
Got it !

211
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,550
Darn...

212
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,720
Three outs. Change.

213
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,530
This is more like it !

214
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,390
Nice batting, Senior Nemoto.

215
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,320
Here you go.

216
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,110
Welcome !

217
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,100
Hello.
 Can I have a daikon ?

218
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,900
Sure.

219
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,450
A daikon, right ? Thanks.

220
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,170
Ma'am, where's the store master ?

221
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,650
As always, he's out 
for a bush-league game.

222
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,630
They have the send-off game 
for the third years of Senkawa...

223
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,630
...the team they've been 
playing against all this time.

224
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,850
I see.

225
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,490
Oh well. Business is less
 important for that baseball fanatic.

226
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,100
Team

227
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,100
Shopping Street Team

228
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,100
Senkawa High School Baseball Club

229
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,550
Good luck, Kunimi !

230
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,700
Thanks !

231
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,300
Oh, I see. 
His father's named Kunimi, too.

232
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,670
Hiro !

233
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,810
What is it ?

234
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,390
You've grown.

235
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,400
I guess.

236
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,960
Your father is proud of you. But you're still not there yet.

237
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,880
You must surpass your 
father and fly further.

238
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,550
Geez. I'm not a butterfly.

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,270
Let's face off !

240
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,420
All right.

241
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,650
Oh ? 

242
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,620
...?

243
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,540
See that, Hiro ? 
Such magical glove-work !

244
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,250
Yeah, right.
It was just a fluke.

245
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:30,800
Huh ?

246
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,450
Uh, oh...

247
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,240
Timeout.

248
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,190
Kunimi, things aren't 
going too well, huh ?

249
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,980
I'm just starting to get hot.

250
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,450
Okay, then.

251
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,250
If we lose...

252
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,180
...you can pick up the tab for the big serving of ramen and pot-stickers at Ken's, right ?

253
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,650
Right ?

254
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm out of gas.

255
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,330
Pitching change.

256
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,420
All right, I'm going to follow up !

257
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,060
Strike ! Batter out !

258
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,990
Damn !

259
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,760
Strike ! Batter out ! Change !

260
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,550
Yamaguchi, Nemoto, 
don't worry about it !

261
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,720
Things are just getting started !
Let's pull ourselves together !

262
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,340
Out !

263
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,450
Out !

264
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,840
It feels like we're playing against a different team.

265
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,200
You're right.

266
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,400
Can they change so much, just by going from fan club to actual baseball club ?

267
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,960
They're working hard, too.

268
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,250
That's right. If we stay complacent, they won't play with us anymore.

269
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,750
Team

270
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,750
Shopping Street Team

271
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,750
Senkawa High School Baseball Club

272
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,700
This is the last inning !
Let's make a comeback win !

273
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,940
Hey, Tome.

274
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,760
Kuma, this isn't good.

275
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,680
Okay, pitching change.

276
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,450
The star pitcher is
 now on the mound.

277
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,630
A Koushien player is pitching ?
 That's not fair !

278
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,440
Be quiet. You guys are aiming
 for the Koushien, too, aren't you ?

279
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,290
He's right.

280
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,440
Strike !

281
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,270
Strike two !

282
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,620
Strike ! Batter out !

283
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,480
The final inning. Runners on first and second, and our at-bats are coming up.

284
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,810
This really is our last.

285
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,440
Yeah.

286
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,660
Timeout !

287
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,400
If you want to play baseball, 
you should attend another school.

288
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
I hate baseball.

289
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,150
Excuse me, Mr. Kuma.

290
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,660
What is it ?

291
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,900
Could you use this 
ball for me and Nemoto ?

292
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,460
Oh.

293
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,400
This is a hardball.

294
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,850
This is the first ball we purchased when we started the fan club.

295
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,560
All right, then.

296
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,370
You want to get struck out 
with a memorable ball, huh ?

297
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,350
No, I'm going to hit it.
No matter what !

298
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,900
Of course, I won't
 take it easy on you !

299
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,840


300
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,470
Foul !

301
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,870
He might just pull it off.

302
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,300
Foul !

303
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,900
Foul !

304
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,100
He's getting his timing right.

305
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,770
You did it, Senior Yamaguchi !

306
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,580
Safe.

307
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,150
Nice batting !

308
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,840
Okay, my turn !

309
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,650
This must be the first
time you've given up a hit.

310
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,430
Yeah.

311
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,030
Now, we're down by just one run ! 
We're putting some pressure on them !

312
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,990
Senior Nemoto, follow it up !

313
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,610
Leave it to me !

314
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,630
Strike !

315
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,500
Strike two !

316
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,990
I guess I can't hit it after all.

317
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,660
Timeout !

318
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,290
Nemoto, relax.

319
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,170
Oh, do I look tense ?

320
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,730
You were totally tense.

321
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,350
More importantly, look how he pitches.

322
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,700
He has some velocity, and he can locate his pitches.

323
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,490
Hm ?

324
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,000
No wonder he's been to the Koushien.

325
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,150
Yeah.

326
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,900
When Mr. Kuma comes up in to
 close out the game, we always lose.

327
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,000
But he has his weakness, too.

328
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,330
Weakness ?

329
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,460
He pitches with the exact same pace.

330
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,650
One, two, and three.

331
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,880
I see.

332
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,550
The important thing
 is to get the timing right.

333
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,650
Okay.

334
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,300
Play !

335
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,840
Time it by one, two, and three.

336
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,100
One...

337
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,480
...two, and...

338
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,350
...three !

339
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,780
You did it !
It's a walkoff homerun !

340
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,300
We did it.

341
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,210
It was a great game.

342
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,220
Heave-ho ! Heave-ho !
Heave-ho ! Heave-ho !

343
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,370
Everyone loves baseball.

Like you, I run up the pedestrian bridge...

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,950
Notes:
The "whisper talk tactic" is a tactic that became widely known after a famous catcher of NPB named Nomura started using it. Basically, you whisper into the ears of the hitter, and try to get into his head, so that the hitter will be out of sync and gets himself out.

354
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:41,250
...keeping up with the sunny sky, I want to feel courageous.

"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

361
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:56,950
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

362
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,130
"I'm definitely glad we met."

363
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Let's stay strong and move forward.

364
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,950
When I'm by myself I notice...

365
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,900
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

366
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,700
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

367
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,000
...there are more and more smiles.

368
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,200
Just by looking at you, see ?

369
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
My eyes will look kinder.

Next Episode

371
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,210
The fall tournament has begun.

372
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,220
If you win it, you can go to the Koushien next spring.

373
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,530
They came really close 
before losing this summer.

374
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,390
Yeah, we definitely want Hideo
 to go to the Koushien this spring.

375
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,440
It'll be fine. See ? He hit a homerun in the first game.


376
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,290
He definitely doesn't restrain himself.

377
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,600
He sure is a big-shot slugger, right ?

378
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,550
Next episode of H2 is, 
"Hide-chan's Phantom Homerun."

379
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,940
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

380
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,950
Next episode of H2 is

381
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,950
Hide-chan's Phantom Homerun

382
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,950
Look forward to it !
