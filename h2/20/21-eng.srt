2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm Kunimi Hiro, a first year pitcher with Senkawa High School's baseball club.

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,650
Our dream came true, and our fan club was upgraded to an official club.

Aim for the Koushien
Kunimi Hiro

16
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,200
I have rediscovered my dream.

17
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,800
Aim for the Koushien
Kunimi Hiro

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,540
At the Koushien, I'll have a 
date with my beloved baseball.

19
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,390
To make that happen, our manager,
Koga Haruka, takes care of my leg injury.

20
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,450
Koga, let's fall in love...

21
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,500
...with baseball.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:08,450

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,100
Reception / Cashier

27
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,250
I've already told you.

28
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,050
A follow-up just means that they'll take a quick look just to be safe.

29
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,500
It's better than some fake doctor, isn't it ?

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,700
Hey...

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,300
No Entry

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,720
The driver has a bad attitude.

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,530
True.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,080
We're ready to go.

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,590
Oh, sure.

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,890
Seriously, you're making it a 
big deal, taking me by car.

37
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,700
But you wouldn't have gone 
there otherwise, would you ?

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,100
Of course not.

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,120
Why would anyone want to go to 
the hospital on a nice day like this ?

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,400
It has air conditioning
 and it's cool inside.

41
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,540
Don't treat me like an elderly person.

42
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,990
Do you want to go somewhere ?

43
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,040
Moron ! That's wrong !

44
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,100
Oh, the squeeze bunt failed !

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,000
The third base runner is in a rundown.

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,000
What are they doing ?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's tagged out !

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Geez, they should read the flow of the game better.

49
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,650
He's talking about baseball.

50
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,460
So, do you want to go somewhere ?

51
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,080
Hmm...

52
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,200
Hi, Mr. Kunimi.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,150
Oh, Hikari. 
Are you looking for Hiro ?

54
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,560
No, I'm just passing by.

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,650
Oh, that's good.

56
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,650
He's out ?

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,380
Yeah. He's out again today, riding in a car with the president's daughter.

58
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,250
The hospital ?

59
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,550
She might be the manager, but she doesn't have to do so much for him.

60
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,200
Isn't that a good thing ?

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Really ?

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,330
It is.

63
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,400
Oh ?

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,350
Hm ?

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,980
Don't you have to go to work today ?

66
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,970
Oh. You know, it's
 hot every day these days.

67
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,950
I don't feel like going to work.

68
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,970
What ? Then you're skipping ?

69
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,720
Not.

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,200
Even for us adults,
there's summer vacation.

71
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,830
I see.

72
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,590
See you.

73
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,370
Bye.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,390
But I'm really glad.

75
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,200
Well, as far as I'm concerned, 
I was hoping more had worn bikinis.

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,650
If they're going to wear a one-pieces,
I wish they'd wear white see-through ones.

77
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,040
I wish I had brought binoculars.

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,010
I'm talking about your leg injury.

79
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh.

80
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,890
Check it out.

81
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,630
That's the opposite leg.

82
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,350
There.

83
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,800
Anyway, there's no need to be impatient.

84
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,190
Everything starts after summer break.

85
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,010
That's right.

86
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,550
The club room, the field, the coach.

87
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,830
Getting new club members after the third years leave.

88
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,340
We have so many things to do. These preparations will take up the entire fall.

89
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,000
Right.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
After the new first 
year students come in...

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,420
...we'll make a splash into the 
preliminary for the Koushien next year.

92
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,800
Ice

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,100
Ice
Cream

94
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,560
Hey, Kunimi, should we have some ?

95
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,440
Hmm...

96
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,000
I prefer that.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000

Shaved Ice

102
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,830
Gather up !

103
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,650
We'll wrap up practice for today.

104
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,200
Instead, we'll have a week 
long camp, starting tomorrow.

105
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,120
What's wrong, Tachibana ?

106
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,720
Um, nothing.

107
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,320
You have something 
else on your schedule ?

108
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,200
N...no.

109
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,650
And of course,
there shouldn't be.

110
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,950
By all rights, we should be at the Koushien right now.

111
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,650
Well, we'll let you rest up for today.

112
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,500
That's all for now.

113
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,600
Thank you.

114
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,450
I wonder if Hikari 
will be angry with me.

115

Oh, it's cold.

119
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,220
Are you okay ?

120
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,250
I'm fine.

121
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,120
You're gulping it down too fast.

122
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,200
It's fine.
I like this ringing pain.

123
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,690
Right, Ma'am ?

124
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,750
That's right. 
You're right on, young man.

125
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,710
See ?

126
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,600
Honestly, the shaved ice that you 
eat under the summer sun is the best.

127
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,760
Exactly !

128
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,510
The summer sun...

129
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,600
The summer sunlight...

130
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,170
The summer sunlight...

131
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,790
I'm Haruka.

132
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,400
Did you say something ?

133
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,110
Um, nothing.

134
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,430
Kunimi, which do you like better, spring or summer ?

135
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,290
Summer of course.

136
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,810
I knew it.

137
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,040
Why ?

138
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,000
No reason.
Just a hunch.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,250
I mean, the spring one is nice, too...

140
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,990
...but if you're going to go to the 
Koushien, the summer one is the best.

141
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,000
The Koushien ?

142
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,390
Besides, we're not going to make it in time for the spring one next year.

143
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,000
After summer break, the fall
 tournament starts right away.

144
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,510
I see. You're right.

145
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,500
Our primary goal should be
 summer's instead of spring's.

146
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes, the summer !

147
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:48,940


148
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,860
So cold.

149
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,810
You're weird.

150
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,240
Oh ? What happened to practice ?

151
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,900
We finished at noon.

152
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,400
Oh, that's rare. 
That practice-loving coach ?

153
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,730
It might rain.

154
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,980
But I wouldn't want it to rain.

155
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,920
We're going to an
 outdoor concert tomorrow.

156
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,680
Sorry.

157
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,130
Huh ?

158
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,000
I can't go.

159
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,930
Why ?

160
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,200
We're doing a training camp, starting tomorrow.

161
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,350
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

162
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,800
Defeat Meiwa Ichi !

163
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,550
It can't be helped.

164
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,100
Yeah, it can't be helped.

165
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,500
But it's a waste not to use the tickets.

166
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,800
Why don't you go ?

167
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,830
With whom ?

168
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,510
Well...maybe Hiro ?

169
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,590
I guess.

170
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,530
EYECATCH

171
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,350
Did you know, Kunimi ?
There are crabs that can walk forward.

172
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,800
You're pulling my leg.

173
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,000
It's true. I read it in some illustrated encyclopedia.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,990
Oh, really ?

175
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,740
Geez.

176
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,950
Hey, watch out.

177
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,420
Why ?

178
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,370
You're a klutz.

179
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,870
I'm not that much of a klutz.

180
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:28,910


181
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,110
Dummy !

182
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,690
Are you okay ?

183
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,450
It's salty.

184
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,050
Man, that was embarrassing.

185
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,960
You don't need to care
 about what others think.

186
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,990
If I were on the mound, yeah.

187
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:22,510
But they probably think 
that we're on a date.

188
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,460
Huh ?

189
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,650
Even though it's 
not at all the case.

190
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,500
 Let's see who can
reach the car first !

191
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,650
Okay.

192
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,550
Oh, it's raining.

193
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,300
Hikari, are you there ?

194
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,370
I am.

195
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,300
It's raining. 
Get the laundry inside.

196
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,820
Okay.

197
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,950
 No postponement for rain.

198
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,810
Okay, there ! Hit-and-run !

199
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,430
Ugh !

200
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,170
Um...

201
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,170
Come to think of it...

202
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,650
Come to think of it,
I think it was around here.

203
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,000
What ?

204
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,270
Well, when I was in elementary school, I slipped and injured my leg badly.

205
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,500
It must have been hard...

206
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,650
...to carry me on their back and walk back to that beach house where my parents were...

207
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,310
...while I was bleeding from my head.

208
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,000
Who did that ?

209
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,900
Well, my height and weight 
were below average back then...

210
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,700
...so it may not have been that bad.

211
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,310
Wow ! It's cleared up !

212
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,870
Do you regret it ?

213
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,590
What ?

214
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,410
Introducing Hikari to Tachibana.

215
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,190
Hmm...

216
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,450
Hmm...

217
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,550
You don't have to think that hard.

218
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,450
If I had introduced her to someone other than Hideo, I'd clearly have some regret.

219
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Really ?

220
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,320
It feels like the opposite.

221
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,230
Hmm...

222
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,210
Well, let's go.

223
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,700
Too bad. I was hoping that
you'd carry me on your back.

224
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,850
Moron. To be honest, 
my leg still hurts a little.

225
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,750
Even if that's true, I still think you'd carry me on your back.

226
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,510
Hey, hurry it up !

227
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,550
Where were you ?

228
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,510
I was watching high school
 baseball on the TV at the café.

229
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,910
He gets another hit ! With this, he's 4-4 with a homerun today.

230
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,650
This is why I said
they should walk him !

231
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,600
They know he's on a roll, right ?

232
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,650
Why don't you fire this driver ?

233
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,250
Right.

234
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,340
How can a coach like that take a team to the quarterfinals ?

235
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,290
I don't know.

236
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,450
More importantly, you should be watching the road while you drive, Brother.

237
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,120
Okay.

238
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,250
But honestly, high school baseball is really interesting. Don't you think ?

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,500
You're right, Mr. Brother.

240
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,690
The sacrifice attempt...is a foul.

241
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,920
What are they doing ?
That's not the right move !

242
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,890
They should let me coach the team.

243
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,150
Hello.

244
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,230
Oh, Hide-chan. Welcome.

245
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,150
Hey, you look like you have a lot of free time on your hands.

246
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,240
What kind of a greeting is this ?

247
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,300
What kind of greeting is that right after you barge into my room ?

248
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,180
From the looks of it, you'll probably have lots of free time on your hands tomorrow, too.

249
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,700
Are you trying to pick a fight ?

250
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,030
Your leg seems to be fine, too.

251
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,270
Hey...

252
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,290
What's this ?

253
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,120
I want you to pinch-hit for me.

254
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,990
Pinch-hit ?

255
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,740
Yeah. Our baseball club is having a week long camp starting tomorrow, all of a sudden.

256
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,990
Good for you.

257
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,200
Hikari asked me to get these tickets, and it was hard work.

258
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,670
So I'm the pinch-hitter ?

259
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,630
Why don't you have her go 
with one of her female friends ?

260
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,150
Moron !

261
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,650
It's well-known that the audiences
 at these concerts are rude and rough !

262
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,050
You have to go with her and make absolutely sure she stays safe !

263
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,680
What a hassle.

264
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,150
Seriously, this unexpected
camp came about...

265
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,740
...all because of that practice game with you guys !

266
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,430
I was looking forward to going to that concert, dammit !

267
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,300
Then you should have
gone to the Koushien.

268
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,360
Anyway, I've already told Hikari.
I'm counting on you !

269
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,050
Is this your way of
 counting on someone ?

270
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,800
Well, I have to prepare for 
tomorrow, so I'm going home.

271
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,870
Aim for the Koushien
Kunimi Hiro

273

Scumbag.

274
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,060
I'm counting on you !

Signs/Writing in Hospital: In case you were wondering about all that here it is. We weren't going to clutter the screen.

Signs above nurse: "For first-time patients" "Hospital Hours."

Card in change tray:  "Hospital Card" "Kunimi Hiro" 
"Keinan University Hospital."

Sign on counter: "Once you leave your hospital card here, please take a seat and wait until your name is called."

283
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,780
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

284
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,710
Notes:
Haruka thinking about summer sunlight: "Hikari" means light, and here, Haruka uses the word "hikari" for sunlight.

Koushien stuff: The result of the fall tournament is part of whether or not a team will be selected to play in Spring Koushien Tournament.

Kunimi's crab joke: It's another homophone pun. "Really ?" is "hontokana ?" But Kunimi changes it to "honto-kani ?" because "kani" means "crab."

285
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:40,630
...rather than the footsteps that


 sound further and further away.

291
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,230
The star I'm watching today...

292
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,710
...glistened yesterday.

293
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,330
In the town full of things that disappear...

294
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,460
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

295
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:06,410
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

296
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:14,560
...rather than losing our time to regret.

297
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,960
Happiness is not something...

298
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,790
...that someone does for me.

299
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:31,360
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

300
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,690
Hiro, do you feel nervous
 about going out with me ?

301
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,270
That's silly. 
Who would get nervous ?

302
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,500
But just the two of us going out 
brings back a lot of memories.

303
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,900
I don't want to hear
 about old times.

304
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,490
Then shall we talk about 
our dreams for the future ?

305
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,100
Dreams ? 
What is your dream ?

306
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,030
Well, what do you think ?
