1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

Presented by Central Anime

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,210
The practice game against Eikyou High School started out as part of the cultural festival.

17
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,500
The fun of baseball is, in part, the battle of wits between us and our opponent.

18
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,500
But there are also those who want to do away with tactics and just go with a head-on fight.

Welcome !

26
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,300
Yakisoba

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,930
Let's eat those.

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,210
Would you like some yakisoba ?

29
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,250
Sweet

It's reasonably priced !

Welcome, Eikyou High School 






Senkawa Festival Baseball Club Invitational Game

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,900
Out !

36
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,950
Next Year's
Spring Invitational
Candidate, 
Eikyou High School, 
Led by the Famous
Coach Shiroyama, 
Is Coming !!

37
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,950
Game Starts
at 1: 00 PM,
Senkawa
Baseball Club

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,750
Good job, Second !

39
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,100
One out ! One out !

40
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,670
Let's pitch-to-contact !

41
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,660
Yeah !

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,460
Let's bait him with a ball up and in.

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,210
Make him pull it 
and pop it up to third.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,020
Good. Third !

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,050
I got it. I got it.

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
Out !

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
Good job, Third.

48
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,800
When he's throwing at that velocity, he can pinpoint his pitches.

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,190
He won't miss his spot.

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,200
He dominated Meiwa's
second string with it, after all.

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,700
Pitch-to-contact and
make his fielders catch.

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
There are many who aren't
 used to playing actual games.

53
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,300
Real game fielding is 
 good practice for them.

54
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,910
Smart.

55
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,590
That's how a practice 
game should be used.

56
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,500
Make him chase it and get
 him out on a grounder to first.

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,000
Foul !

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,950
What a shame. It went foul.

59
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,170
But has Hiro ever pitched a whole game like that ?

60
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,500
There's no way he could, 
given his disposition.

61
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,400
I wonder if that's his
 strength or weakness.

62
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,780
Either way, I like that about him.

63
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,570
Strike !

64
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,600
Our guys don't seem to get it.
 Why don't you tell them, Hirota ?

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,600
About that pitch you struck out on.

66
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,930
I didn't time it right.
That's all it was.

67
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,090
Oh.

68
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,700
Because you praised him so much, I was expecting a faster pitch.

69
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,100
I see.

70
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,630
Sorry about that.

71
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,630
One more !

72
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,000
All right !

73
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,700
Out !

74
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,990
Three outs ! Change !

75
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,820
He's gotten senile.

76
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,960
That punk.

77
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,990
Don't compare me to 
that good-for-nothing.

78
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,190
Play !

79
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,890
Strike !

80
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,340
Strike two !

81
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,460
Strike ! Batter out !

82
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,500
Strike ! Batter out !

83
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,170
Strike ! Batter out !

84
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,150
Change !

85
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,960
Wow, Hirota !

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,220
So cool !

87
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,120
Hirota !

88
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,500
Three strikeouts, all in three pitches. Nine pitches and done.

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,690
And he's only using 
80% of his power.

90
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,830
All right, we can do it, too !

91
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,390
Don't fall behind a guy like that !

92
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,000
An eye for an eye 
and a tooth for a tooth.

93
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,760
Let's go, Noda.

94
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,910
Okay.

95
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
Shall we go for three strikeouts ?

96
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,000
Then...

97
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,000
...this.

98
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,800
Ball.

99
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,340
The next one is a little more in.

100
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,990
All right ! A grounder to short !

101
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,720
Out !

102
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,480
Are we going to make the outfielders work now ?

103
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,400
This time, here.

104
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,710
Ball.

105
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,290
Next, here.

106
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,690
Ball.

107
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,020
He's missing by one
 ball's width, it seems.

108
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,380
No, he's intentionally throwing there.

109
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,270
Now, throw here, and 
it'll be a fly ball to left.

110
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,980
Out !

111
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,960
Good job, Left !

112
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,900
What part of it is "good" ?

113
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,150
It looks so shaky !

114
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,700
If you're going to make him hit, make them hit it toward me !

115
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,550
Oh, sure.

116
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,400
Then let's do that.

117
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,990
Next, it'll be a weak pop-up to center.

118
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,710
Now, will Kine be able to catch it ?

119
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,770
... Ah !

120
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,630
Nice back up, Right !

121
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,480
Ouch...

122
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,620
Don't dawdle around !

123
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,780
You suck !

124
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,850
Hey, Kine ! 
What're you doing there ?

125
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,000
You're lousy !

126
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,810
Three more pitches left.

127
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,700
The seventh pitch will be here.

128
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,370
Ball.

129
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,850
The eighth pitch.

130
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,110
Ball.

131
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,700
Now, let's finish it with this ninth pitch.

132
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,610
Okay.

133
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,450
Out !

134
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,800
Yeah !

135
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,450
I see.

136
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,530
Yeah, you saved me, Noda.

137
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,800
Of course.

138
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,950
So this is it.

139
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,680
What is ?

140
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,900
You weren't counting ?

141
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,780
Counting what ?

142
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,170
I returned the favor by retiring 
the side in precisely nine pitches.

143
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,610
Huh ?

144
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,450
No doubt about it. 
It really was nine pitches.

145
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,740
Wonderful !

146
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,550
So what ?

147
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,330
Nothing.

148
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:26,990
Oh, okay.

149
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,910


150
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,920
Aim for the Koushien

151
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,280


152
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,820
Aim for the Koushien

153
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,030
Good luck !

154
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,700
You're so handsome !

155
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,990
Give it your best, Hirota !

156
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
Hirota !

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So cool !

158
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,030
Hirota !

159
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,000
Hirota...

160
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,960
Play !

161
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,120
Strike !

162
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,240
Hirota...!

163
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,250
Mifuji Junior High

164
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,150
Hey, Sagawa.

165
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,570
I guess we weren't
 meant to be, Sagawa.

166
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,170
Strike two !

167
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,600
Our relationship doesn't 
seem to be over yet, Hirota.

168
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,150
Strike ! Batter out !

169
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,170
With that swing, the ball won't move
 forward even if he connects on a pitch.

170
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,000
You're right.

171
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,400
Add 100 more swings
to his training menu.

172
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,280
Sure.

173
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,050
Hm ?

174
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,660
The second time through the lineup, we have a chance.

175
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,060
Kine, shorten it up
and swing for contact !

176
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,060
There's no way I'm going to just swing for contact.

177
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,960
Strike !

178
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,500
Wonderful. If he connects, it'll have some distance.

179
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,500
He has it timed right.

180
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,230
He wasn't late on that fastball.

181
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,300
In terms of his athletic talent
 and running speed, he's good.

182
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,120
If he weren't so hung up on looking good, he could be a great lead-off batter.

183
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,950
It's just a matter of time, then.

184
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,200
Before, he was sort 
of popular with girls.

185
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,140
But these days, everyone 
knows what he's really like.

186
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,760
Marvelous.

187
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,550
I'm declaring a ho...

188
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,550
...hokekyo.

189
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,590
Strike ! Batter out !

190
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,140
It will take time, I guess.

191
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Strike !

192
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,780
Strike two !

193
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,800
Strike ! Batter out !

194
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,200
A "shoot," a curveball, and then...

195
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,240
The last one was a slider.

196
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,100
And it had such a sharp break that you couldn't get to it.

197
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,600
He's good. No wonder
 he's going to the Koushien.

198
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,850
He's in the same block, and 
he's a first-year, the same as us.

199
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,740
We can't just wait for
 his graduation, I guess.

200
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,760
I guess.

201
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,030
After three innings, the score is 1-1.

202
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,900
What do you think of this 
development, Analyst Tachibana ?

203
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,450
It will be a tight pitcher's duel
 for the next few innings, I think.

204
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,100
Nice batting !

205
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,000
Go for it !

206
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,340
I mean, there's a large individual talent gap between their players and ours.

207
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,500
Oh ? Is it just the players ?

208
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,510
Huh ?

209
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,950
Don't you think the largest talent gap is the one that exists between their coach and ours ?

210
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,930
Ho...

211
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,830
...hokekyo.

212
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,500
After all, he is the 
famous field manager...

213
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,520
...who has the experience of winning one spring and two summer Koushien championships.

214
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,710
Wonderful.

215
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,310
Hey, Hirota...

216
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,960
Just leave it to me.

217
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,400
Okay, then.

218
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,890
I'll show you just how small the fish that got away is.

219
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,400
Hirota ! Hit it !

220
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,300
This at-bat won't be an easy one.

221
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,830
I agree.

222
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,400
First, this.

223
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,990
Low and away.

224
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,870
Strike !

225
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,230
The same pitch in the same spot.

226
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,540
I don't get the feeling that he 
doesn't like low balls, though.

227
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,360
Strike two !

228
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,690
What is he waiting for ?

229
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:28,840
...?

230
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,020
You want me to declare a strikeout ?

231
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,830
That's stupid. This is just a
 practice game at a cultural festival.

232
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,000
But...

233
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
But...

234
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,960
Hey now...!

235
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,530
Hiro is getting serious.

236
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,820
Let's do it, then.

237
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,300
Fastball...

238
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,370
...right down the middle !

239
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,610
Wow !

240
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,800
He did it !

241
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,350
He let him hit ?

242
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,710
No, he got beat.

243
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,890
That was his max effort ?

244
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,870
Yeah.

245
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,070
Home in.

246
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,910
A small fish is a small fish.

247
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,980
Hmm...

248
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,750
There's no need 
to worry. He's fine.

249
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:01,100
Unlike Hirota, who is pretty much already perfected as a high school pitcher...

250
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
...Hiro is still in the 
process of growing.

251
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,500
That's why his max 
effort isn't always stable.

252
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:17,000
If he gets tense, like he gets mad or moody, his pitch quality fluctuates.

253
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,550
That's his weakness
 at the current stage.

254
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,550
It's not a part
 of his strength, is it ?

255
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,490
Regardless, I like that about him.

256
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,020
Hey, Hiro.

257
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,020
Ugh !

275
00:22:51,870 --> 00:23:00,180
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

276
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,480
"I'm definitely glad we met."

277
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,300
Let's stay strong and move forward.

278
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,030
When I'm by myself I notice...

279
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,980
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

280
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,780
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

281
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,030
...there are more and more smiles.

282
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,480
Just by looking at you, see ?

283
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,580
My eyes will look kinder.

284

Next Episode

285
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,640
In the game against Eikyou, Hiro's 
competitive spirit is starting to show.

286
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,370
Shut up, outsider.

287
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,150
You want them to underestimate you until summer, don't you ?

288
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,430
Coach Shiroyama and Hirota.

289
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,760
The baseball they play isn't the only kind of baseball.

290
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,570
Yeah. Let's feel good
 about playing baseball.

291
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,900
Besides, it's too long
 to wait till next summer !

292
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,200

296
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,450
Look forward to it !

297
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,720
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
