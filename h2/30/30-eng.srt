Repeating seasons...

00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

16
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,600
In the end, Hikari couldn't
 turn down Hideo's request.

17
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,200
She ended up agreeing to go on a date with Sagawa.

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,950
I thought she'd be safe 
because Hideo was watching.

19
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,400
And that led to this debacle.

20

Hikari's Lie, Hiro's Tears

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,800
But really, where the heck could they have gone ?

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,600
Hey !

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,640
Huh ?

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,330
Are you actually looking for her ?

28
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,220
Yeah, I am.

29
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,840
You're just wandering around...

30
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,900
Hey, wait up, Hide !

Danger:  Do Not Touch

32
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,440
I'm surprised.

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Me, too.

34
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,650
Knowing you, I didn't
 think you were serious.

35
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,650
I'm amazed.

36
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,880
I couldn't have imagined a beautiful girl like her.

37
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,270
Give it up, Risa !

38
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,000
You're no match for her !

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,900
Don't just stand there !
Come on down !

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,190
I hear that this idiot barged into your apartment the other day.

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,430
Yeah.

42
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,900
If only she'd known that you had a beautiful girlfriend like her...

43
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,200
...she wouldn't have done a stupid thing like that.

44
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,170
Sorry to trouble you.

45
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,690
I've been telling you. I've got
 nothing to do with your girlfriend.

46
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,360
Yeah, I know.

47
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,250
This idiot has one-sidedly fallen for you.

48
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,290
Let go of me already !

49
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,350
I haven't seen you in a while.
Why don't we go get something to eat ?

50
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,090
Sure.

51
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,580
You have other plans, right ?

52
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,200
What ?

53
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,590
Oh, yes, yes.

54
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,760
Then you can leave now.

55
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,020
Yeah, sure.

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,360
Hold it !

57
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,000
She's way too beautiful.
I just can't believe it.

58
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,700
Are you two really going out ?

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,400
If you two are really dating...

60
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,100
...why don't you kiss each other,
right in front of our eyes ?

61
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,250
If you do, Risa will no 
longer follow you around...

62
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,370
...and I can go home 
with peace of mind.

63
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,270
Hmm...

64
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,730
She's fine.
 It's Shuu, after all.

65
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,910
But you only knew him
 up until five years ago.

66
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,750
But Shuu is still Shuu.

67
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,960
Oh ? You're certain ?

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,790
Yeah.

69
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,830
Then, shall we stop looking for her ?

70
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,990
...!

71
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,760
Perhaps...

72
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,240
Hey, give me a break.

73
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,560
Unlike you, our relationship is pure.

74
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,240
Besides, it's been less than a 
month since we started going out.

75
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,080
I guess you're right.

76
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,550
Keyaki

77
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,530
Hiroshima-style,
Okonomiyaki

78
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,430
Hiroshima-style,
Okonomiyaki

79
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,300
What are we doing here,
 grilling an okonomiyaki like this ?

80
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,920
This restaurant used to 
be an old haunt of ours.

81
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,300
You told me that already.

82
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,630
What I'm saying is, we could just look inside, and then go elsewhere if we didn't find Hikari !

83
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,460
But...


84
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,760
Really, I haven't seen
you in a long time.

85
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,200
You've gotten bigger...

86
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,920
...but your face is still the same as it 
was when you were in grade school !

87
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,630
I'm so happy to see you !

88
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,560
Me, too...

89
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,700
When she's acting so happy, do you 
actually think that we can just take off ?

90
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,540


91
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,900
And look ! She treated 
us to a serving of this.

92
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,960
Hmm...

93
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,400
Anyway, just eat !

94
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,720
It's tasty !

95
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,100
Then let's do this.

96
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,500
Let me spend an hour with
 your girlfriend, just me and her.

97
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,710
...?

98
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,200
That's okay, right, Shuu ?

99
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,510
I mean, you had a date 
with Risa once, too.

100
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,090
But that's because she forced me...!

101
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,830
Just one hour.

102
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,020
I'm saying that'll make us even.

103
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Keyaki

104
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,020
Now where are we going to look ?

105
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,550
I'm not sure.

106
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,900
He's your childhood friend, isn't he ?

107
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,040
You should know 
where he might go.

108
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,360
If it's not here...

109
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,090
Where ?!

110
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,330
It might be the ramen
shop we used to go to.

111
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,500
Let go of her.

112
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,900
What did you just say ?

113
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,850
I said let go of her.

114
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,700
Stop it, Shuu. You know that Jin's uncontrollable when he gets mad.

115
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm sure you didn't forget.

116
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,870
I broke two of your ribs, after all.

117
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
Thank you !

118
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,170
They weren't here.

119
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,430
I guess not.

120
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,650
What do you mean, "I guess not" ?

121
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,700
Hey, Hide !

122
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,300
Huh ?

123
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,530
I don't want to say it, but
 aren't you awfully casual ?

124
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,600
Really ?

125
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,480
It's okay.

126
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,000
Hikari is your girlfriend. 
It's none of my business.

127
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,550
Hey, Hiro !

128
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,290
Back then, I wasn't trying to kill you.

129
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,500
But this time, it's different.

130
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,600
Two broken ribs won't 
end the fight today.

131
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,120
If you don't want to be killed, you should kill me.

132
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,500
She's an important person.

133
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,190
I have to protect her,
 even if it costs my life.

134
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,680
Interesting.

135
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,250
EYECATCH

136
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
Okay, I get it.

137
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,800
This is what you do to a friend who came all the way here to see you ?

138
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,020
We're going home, Risa.

139
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,800
Sure...

140
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,300
I'm breaking it off with you, moron !

141
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,270
Huh...

142
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,450
I guess we scared you.

143
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,700
This is terrible.
 My legs are shaking.

144
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,000
What a friend you have.

145
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,300
When you transfer to a school 
where you don't know anyone...

146
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,060
...the easiest way to make friends is to enter the circle of bad guys.

147
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,400
You don't seem to have
 good social skills, after all.

148
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,000
I wonder if I should thank you.

149
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,830
There's no need.

150
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,100
I plan to have Hide-chan take care of me for the foreseeable future.

151
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,540
I don't want him to break
it off with me right now.

152
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,270
...

153
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:19,900
There's a great okonomiyaki place nearby.

154
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,700
Do you want to go ?

155
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
You're done with me, right ?

156
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,550
I guess.

157
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,290
You brat ! 
Don't underestimate me !

158
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,900
Take that...!

159
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,120
Which way is the train station ?

160
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,950
Do you know ?

161
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,760
It's probably this way.

162
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,050
Okay then.

163
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,060
Well, I guess I'll go home and study for the entrance exam.

164
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,160
Entrance exam...?

165
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,640
Yeah, I don't want to get a job yet.

166
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,500
I plan to go to high school.

167
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,580
Hey, you're younger than me ?

168
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,470
Huh ? Hide-chan didn't tell you ?

169
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,150
Not a word !

170
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,210
Hmm ?

171
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,950
Stop it !

172
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,670
What're you talking about now ?
It's okay, right ? Right ?

173
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,330
But...

174
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:01,940
I mean...

175
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,150
Hey !

176
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,080
What is it ?

177
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,510
Um, have you seen a 
suspicious man around here ?

178
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:19,920


179
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh, thank you.

180
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,650
Sorry about that.

181
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,400
Dammit ! 
Why should I care ?!

182
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,650
She's your girlfriend !

183
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,300
You should...

184
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,400
...take care of her !

185
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,650
Amamiya

186
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,020
I'm home !

187
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,870
Oh, Hiro. Hikari is here.

188
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,360
What ?

189
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,500
I let her into your room.

190
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,930
What're you doing in
 here with the lights off ?

191
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,860
Where were you ?

192
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,730
Didn't you promise me that you'd watch over me and rescue me ?

193
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,810
Um, well...

194
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,680
Liar.

195
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,910
Hikari...

196
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,500


197
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,980
What happened ?

198
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,600
He said he was 
meeting up with a friend...

199
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
...and took me to a deserted 
factory site with three chimneys.

200
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,200
I trusted that you'd come save me.

201
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,330


202
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,690
Hiro ?

203
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,060
Hey !

204
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
You're late.

205
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,320
Yeah.

206
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,930
What happened to your face ?

207
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,090
Um...

208
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,270
Did Shuu do it ?

209
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,990
No. I was walking absent-mindedly, and bumped into a signboard.

210
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,980
I see.

211
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,650
Hmm ? What's this ?

212
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,610
So this Shuu guy 
really is a troublemaker ?

213
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,000
What ? Um, well...

214
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,640
You're acting suspiciously.

215
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,850
I see. His friend did come.

216
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,110
So you were a little suspicious of him ?

217
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,500
Hiro was.
 I knew it was going to be okay.

218
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,530
Really ?

219
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,300
I guess I was a little worried, too.

220
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,320
It's been five years, after all.

221
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,900
Back then, he was like 
my real younger brother.

222
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,060
I could always tell
 what he was up to.

223
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,920
He's not the only one who's changed in five years.

224
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,050
Are you talking about me ?

225
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,200
Even though you couldn't 
go to the Koushien...

226
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,700
...you've been featured
 in all kinds of media...

227
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,740
...and you've become a celebrity who 
gets letters from fans all over the country.

228
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,200
You've become too distant a figure for 
him to just feel happy about your reunion.

229
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,290
Especially since he had 
fallen in with bad company.

230
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,120
But I wondered if he had completely quit.

231
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,100
What ?

232
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,090
Baseball, I mean.

233
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,870
I'm not sure.

234
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,580
Come to think of it, I wonder if Hiro is still out there looking for you.

235
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,550
That's right, you should call him.

236
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,680
I think he should be home by now.

237
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,650
Hikari.

238
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,150
Huh ?

239
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
Call him.

240
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,360
Oh, right.

241
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,200
Oh, Hiro ? That's right.

242
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,360
There's no need to worry. 
Yeah, bye.

243
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
Okay, I'll get him this time !

244
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,350
Hm ?

245
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,200
Sorry about what happened today.

246
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,810
It's okay.

247
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,800
Okay.

248
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,250
See you.

249
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,890
Yeah.

Notes:


259
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:41,280
...keeping up with the sunny sky, I want to feel courageous.

267
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:56,630
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

268
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,930
"I'm definitely glad we met."

269
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,750
Let's stay strong and move forward.

270
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,480
When I'm by myself I notice...

271
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,430
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

272
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,230
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

273
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,480
...there are more and more smiles.

274
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,930
Just by looking at you, see ?

275
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,030
My eyes will look kinder.

276

Next Episode

277
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,390
The cheek that you 
slapped is still swollen.

278
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,000
There's something more important going on.
 The final game of the fall tournament.

279
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,690
Meiwa Daiichi's opponent is Eikyou High School, which features the ace pitcher, Hirota.

280
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,120
Because of his refreshing smile, his popularity is rising fast.

281
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,090
But he's kind of weird.

282
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,510
Yeah, he seems to have a dark side to him.

283
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,050
He made a signal predicting a strikeout on Hide-chan.

284
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,680
Next episode of H2 is,
 "A New Rival ! Eikyou's Hirota."

288
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,700
Look forward to it !

289
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,980
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

290
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:05,750
