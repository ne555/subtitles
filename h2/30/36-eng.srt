...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,830
Hirota shows off with flashy plays like
 three consecutive three-pitch strikeouts.

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
In other words, he retired
 the side in just nine pitches.

18
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,380
He's an enemy of my
 pitch-to-contact style of pitching.

He let him hit ?

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,460
No, he got beat.

25
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,300
That was his max effort ?

26
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

27
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,820
There's no need to worry.

28
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,150
Hirota is pretty much already 
perfected as a high school pitcher...

29
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,250
...but Hiro is still in
the process of growing.

30
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,750
He isn't consistent yet,

 Hiro is making on the mound right now.

That's right.

71
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,400
It's a part of the festivities.
 It's just an invitational game.

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,390
Yes. Wonderful.

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,500
Strike !

74
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,600
He's amazing, too.

75
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah !

76
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,800
Dang !

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
It was close...

78
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
Nice catch, shortstop.

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,870
After six innings, the score is 7-1.

80
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,010
Getting to the Koushien
 isn't so easy, I guess.

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,010
It's 3-1.

82
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,100
Eh ?

83
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,600
In my scorebook, that is.

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,500
Kunimi is giving up hits,
 but he's painting corners.

85
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,300
On a team with ordinary fielding skills, 
most of those would have been outs.

86
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,500
See ? All we need is an
 ordinary fielding team.

87
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,850


88
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,690
We don't need any amazing plays.

89
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,200
We just need people who can catch things within their range without panicking.

90
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,240
If we had that, this one, this one, and this one would also be outs.

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,110
The homerun in the first inning would've
 been a routine right field fly in a normal park.

92
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,140
It's 3-1.

93
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,070
Ordinary fielding ability...

94
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,040
This is enough, right, Coach ?

95
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,700
For a game like this, there's no point in making the ace pitcher throw a complete game.



96
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,500
Right.

97
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,870
There's no point, 
if Kunimi stays like that.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,820
Safe !

99
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,200
That one, too. If he were a 
shortstop with a strong arm...

100
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,600
You just need ordinary defense, right ?

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,380
He did catch the ball.

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,710
That's right. 
We shouldn't be too greedy.

103
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,150
Don't worry, Satou. 
You did well on that one.

104
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,380


105
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,870
Okay ! I'll make them put the next one in play, too !

106
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,640
All right !

107
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,700
You have a good arm, Sagawa.

108
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,630
On our baseball club...

109
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,630
...there's never been anyone who's 
become a regular shortstop as a first year.

110
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,780
I'm pulling for you.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,990
Out !

112
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,890
Good ! Two outs ! Two outs !

113
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah !

114
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,670
In place of Hirota, 
Mukai will pinch hit !

115
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,450
They're saying that it's a waste to have the ace pitcher throw anymore in this game.

116
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,200
As it is...

117
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,320
...that coach would probably thank you for turning down his invitation to come to Eikyou...

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,860
...I bet.

119
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,740
They got Hirota because of that, after all.

120
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,050
Yeah. He should be able to go home with no lingering attachment now.

121
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,700
We got them to underestimate us until a real game.

122
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,930
Yeah, until the preliminary next summer.

123
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,890
Until the preliminary next summer...

124
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,440
That's right. 
It's going according to plan.

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,160
I think it's about time.

126
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,450
What ?

127
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,030
Until then, they'll continue to underestimate me.

128
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,710
I'm telling you, it's all 
going according to plan.

129
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,570
Later.

130
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,550
Hmm...

131
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,580
Play !

132
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,000

When you get this far...

136
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
...there's no need to 
give them any real data.

137
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,370
There's no need, but...

138
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,560
Strike !

139
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,080
Oh no...

140
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,500
I guess this is what happens.

141
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,550
Today is a cultural festival day.

142
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,990
We've got to have some fun, right ?

143
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,200
Wow, amazing !

144
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,030
Strike ! Batter out !

145
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,580
It's so fast !

146
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,840
So he finally shows his real power.

147
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,070
But honestly, he throws hard.

148
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,870


149
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,800
Aim for the Koushien

150
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,830
Aim for the Koushien

151
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,950


152
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,930
Our top pinch-hitter swung three times and didn't even come close to making contact.

153
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,550
Nice pitching !

154
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:41,290
I was going to praise him if he had kept up his frivolous pitching till the end.

155
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,010
In the end, he's just
 a baseball-loving boy.

156
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,200
For a superior team,
 the first contest is always tricky.

157
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,300
Regardless of whether he 
could actually fool me or not....

158
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,300
...there was no need for him to
 introduce himself to us in a game like this.

159
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,200
When the inferior team 
exposes its true ability...

160
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,740
...the contest always ends up the same as what the ranking says.

161
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,900
If he can't even throw away a meaningless game like this...

162
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,620
...there's no way they
 can pull an upset.

163
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,550
Play !

164
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,440
Now, come on !

165
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,100
Kunimi !

166
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,620
It starts here !

167
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Yep.

168
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,900
He did it !

169
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,740
Good job, Kunimi !

170
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,990
Honestly, this is more like Hiro.

171
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,700
Yeah.

172
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,400
I don't need guys who enjoy baseball.

173
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,330
Hirota...

174
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,460
...you like winning
 better than baseball.

175
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,200
That's how it should be.

176
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,350
What you do to win is 
always the right thing to do.

177
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:42,040
Whether it's practice, strategy, or tactic, no matter what it is.

178
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,270
All right.

179
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,200
Yeah ! We're now 
down by just one run !

180
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,000
One run ?

181
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,500
Yes, wonderful.

182
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,650
Player substitution, shortstop.

183
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,890
Shortstop ?

184
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,810
Why ?

185
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,650
Who knows ?

186
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,190
Why did you change your defensive positioning ?

187
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,000
Based on how the batter was squaring up and where the catcher's mitt was...

188
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,500
...I decided that it 
was best to do so.

189
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,330
Have you ever seen a chess piece move on its own ?

190
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,200
Huh ? No, I haven't.

191
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,300
Why did you change your defensive positioning ?

192
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,800
Like I said...

193
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
...based on how the batter was squaring up and where the catcher's mitt was...

194
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,130
...I decided...

195
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,980
I decided...

196
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,650
I'm sorry !

197
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,750
Now, we need one more run.

198
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,630
Yeah.

199
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,950
Out !

200
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,290
Don't worry about that !

201
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Strike !

202
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,050
Oh, they can't even get
 a sacrifice bunt down ?

203
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,340
Just like Hiro, this
 team is still growing.

204
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,500
Strike ! Batter out !

205
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,010
Don't worry about it !

206
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,700
Yeah !

207
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,300
What's the point of getting the 
sacrifice bunt down with two outs ?

208
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,510
Um...

209
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,400
Out !

210
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't worry.

211
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,650
Coaches are evaluated based on the numbers.

212
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,100
Whether the coach is a good person or not doesn't mean anything.

213
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,490
In order to win, I've ruined or 
abandoned many players over the years.

214
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,190
Players are disposable, 
but there's only one coach.

215
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,010
Players graduate and leave, but I stay.

216
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,120
Three national championships total, in spring and summer.


217
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,770
Because of that record, I am the 
"Great Field Manager Shiroyama."

218
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,870
Listen, Hirota.

219
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,540
I'm going to use you 
to enhance my status.

220
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,050
I won't forgive you 
if you become useless.

221
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,730
I'll pitch-to-contact !

222
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,200
But he doesn't really intend to.

223
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,460
That's right.

224
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,940
What a weird team.

225
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,180
Oh well.

226
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,650
Strike !

227
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,620
Hey...

228
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,080
Start videotaping.

229
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,110
Y...yes, sir.

230
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,550
Strike !

231
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,710
Strike ! Batter out !

232
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,670
Let's pitch-to-contact !

233
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,240
They're videotaping.

234
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,980
He's a reputable coach.

235
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,810
He probably has ways of 
attacking any type of pitcher.

236
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,580
But...

237
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,550
There's no guarantee that this data will still remain viable next year.

238
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,350
Hmm...

239
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,690
High school players change dramatically in half a year.

240
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,510
He probably takes that
 into consideration, too.

241
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,980
Mmm...

242
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,160
Strike ! Batter out !

243
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,710
Two strikeouts in a row !

244
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,270
No, it started last inning.

245
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,790
Three consecutive strikeouts !

246
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,350
Yeah.

247
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,010
Wonderful !

248
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,000
Even if he takes that 
 into consideration...

249
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,650
...he's probably only thinking along
 the line of a cat turning into a tiger...

250
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,150
...or a dog turning into a wolf, right ?

251
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
Strike !

252
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,250
He probably doesn't think about a cat turning into a whale or a dog turning into an eagle.

253
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,180
Um, I guess.

254
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,000
With an inflexible mind like that...

255
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,630
...there's no way he can project Hiro half a year from now.

256
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,800

258
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,570
Strike ! Batter out ! Change !

259
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,460
Yeah !

260
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,670
Yeah !

261
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,770
That's right. There's no way to 
project Hiro half a year from now.

"ho-hokekyo" is the onomatopoeia for the crooning of a nightingale.

00:22:51,770 --> 00:23:00,080
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

280
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,380
"I'm definitely glad we met."

281
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,200
Let's stay strong and move forward.

282
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,930
When I'm by myself I notice...

283
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,880
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

284
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,680
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

285
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,930
...there are more and more smiles.

286
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,380
Just by looking at you, see ?

287
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,480
My eyes will look kinder.

Hiro, the game against 
Eikyou has ended, right ?

290
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,400
Yeah, it's over. We lost, though.

291
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,150
Let's move on.

292
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,120
See ? The school festival folk dance is starting.

293
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,650
Oh, no !

294
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,350
You've got to find your partner.

295
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,840
I'll be fine. I know
 a dream Miss Senkawa.

Next episode of H2 is, "Achoo ! Waiting in Vain Inside the Cardboard Box."

Are you having a refreshing workout ?
