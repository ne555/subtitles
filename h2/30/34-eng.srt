00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,800
Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,450
Eikyou, a candidate for selection to the Spring Invitational...

17
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,450
...features Hirota, the ace
 pitcher who broke Hideo's arm.

18
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,200
As well as the famous field manager...

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,000
...Coach Shiroyama, who tried to 
recruit me when I was in junior high.

20
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,120
And with Sagawa, too, there's some bad blood between him and Hirota.

21
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:08,960

 Episode 34

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,250
I Don't Dislike a Serious Fight

25
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,550
Welcome, Eikyou High School

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,550
Senkawa Festival Baseball Club Invitational Game

27
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:29,500
Eikyou High School

28
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,490
He can't spot his pitches.

29
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,350
That's the pitcher you took the trouble 
to arrange a practice game to see ?

30
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,290
The catcher seems very calm for someone catching a wild pitcher.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,400
I don't like pitchers who 
can't control their pitches.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,490
With that kind of pitcher,
 I can't make any game plans.

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,160
I recruited you because of 
your exceptional pitch control.

34
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,190
You can pitch where you aim.

35
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,610
Whether it's the mitt or the batter.

36
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,930
And this pitcher intrigued me.

37
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,470
He's pitching where 
he's aiming just fine.

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,610
All right !

39
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,120
The fish that got away 
is that impressive ?

40
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,900
I wonder if he's trying to 
show that he's wild today.

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,330
No, he's trying to warm him up.

42
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,490
Warming up Noda, that is.

43
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,300
I see.

44
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,450
Okay, I'm warmed up now. Thanks.

45
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,500
Was that about right ?

46
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,210
Yeah. It's not good to sit in 
the same place for too long.

47
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,610
Damn him...!

48
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,990
Senkawa Festival

49
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,330
What shall we eat ?

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
I hope there's something...

51
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,000
Senkawa Festival

52
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,150

No-Name School Comes ! Soccer Club Invitational Game. Kickoff at 1 PM

55
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,200
No-Name School Comes !

56
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,200
Soccer Club
Invitational Game.

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,200
Kickoff at 1 PM

58
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,650
Our opponent is a candidate to make a Koushien appearance.

59
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,300
We're the challengers.
 Let's give it our best !

60
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,660
Yeah !

61
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,070
The upperclassmen are fired up.

62
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,100
We have to give them some work to do, so let's pitch-to-contact.

63
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,960
Kunimi.

64
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,800
Let's go with this.

65
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,000
What's that ?


66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,500
It's how you'll 
declare a strikeout.

67
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,320
Oh...

68
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,480
It's a decent-sized crowd.

69
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,100
I can see contrails, too.

70
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,290
He seems more 
serious than I expected.

71
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,800
Yeah. Hiro is 
serious about baseball.

72
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,630
Play ball !

73
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,610
Well...

74
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,280
Strike !

75
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,960
That was the first pitch to say nice
 to meet you. How did you like it ?

76
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,360
Right on the inside corner.
 What great control.

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,980
Yeah.

78
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,330
Strike two !

79
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,730
You're not pitching to contact...

80
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,840
That's fine.

81
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,010
Oh. He won't swing at a
 pitch right down the middle ?

82
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,640
I mean, you're throwing too hard.

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,250
Incredible.
 He's declaring a strikeout.

84
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,330
Eh ?

85
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,600
Huh ?

86
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,930
I guess they can slug away at a 
soft pitch right down the middle.

87
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,030
I guess it was just his habit.

88
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,020
What do you think about the fish that got away ?

89
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,410
In a normal ballpark, it would just be a routine fly right field.

90
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,330
He's supposed to be aware of how small the park is.

91
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,100
That was generous of you to give up a homerun right from the start.

92
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,670
It's just a part of the festivity.

93
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,180
It doesn't matter if we win or lose..


94
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,500
It's better if they'd just overlook us, rather than tightening their guard against us.

95
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,190
Your facial expression
 doesn't match your words.

96
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,060
I want them to 
think that I'm upset !

97
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,550
You're actually upset, aren't you ?

98
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,900
Shut up.

99
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,060
Homeruns don't do much for fielding practice, so let's make them hit infield grounders.

100
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,750
Okay.

101
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,090
He picked the right 
time to talk to the pitcher.

102
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,200
Hiro gets worked up pretty easily.

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,690
Yeah.

104
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,180
Noda took the timeout
 at the perfect time.

105
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,560
They meant to pitch-to-contact,
 and it ended up being a homerun.

106
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,640
But there's no pitcher who likes giving up homeruns.

107
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,970
He has a closed stance, so that means he has the tendency to open up.

108
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,930
Low and away. Let's get him
 out on a grounder to third base.

109
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,400
Third base ! Arikawa !

110
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,320
Out !

111
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,300
Okay ! Okay ! One out ! One out !

112
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,530
The three hitter is
shortening up his swing.

113
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,750
He's swinging for contact.

114
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,200
He'll react to any pitch ?

115
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,300
Then let's pitch him in, just outside the zone, for a hit to the shortstop.

116
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,670
He'll hit it to the shortstop.

117
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,850
What an unsteady infield.

118
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,970
Nice back up !

119
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,440
Hirota !

120
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,700
He's amazing !

121
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,000
So handsome !

122
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,990
Next up is the pitcher,
 hitting cleanup, Hirota.

123
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,300
Wow, scary.

124
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,020
I know.
 I'm counting on you, Yanagi.

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,570
A grounder to second, 
for a double play !

126
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,800
Welcome, Eikyou High School

127
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,800
Senkawa Festival Baseball Club Invitational Game

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,010
Foul !

129
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,510
I guess I was being too hopeful, trying for a double play.

130
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,060
If he's going to pull it, let's get 
him out on a fly ball to center.

131
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,860
I'm counting on you, Kine.

132
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,480
Foul.

133
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,520
He's a first-rate batter, too.

134
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,000
He's seen you hit.
Hiro's not fazed.

135
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,980
I don't dislike a serious fight.

136
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,120
That's his signal
to predict a strikeout.

137
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh...

138
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,440


139
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,770
Aim for the Koushien

140
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,670
Aim for the Koushien

141
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,170


142
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,970
That's his signal to
 predict a strikeout.

143
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,550
Oh...

144
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,040
Your eyes are brimming
 with a thirst for blood.

145
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,300
Fall baseball...

146
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
...must be...

147
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,550
...wholesome.

148
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,900
Out !

149
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,090
Wow ! Amazing !

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Phew.

151
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,750
Punk...!

152
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,120
The fish that got away...

153
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,230
A strikeout to a double
 play. That's timely.

154
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,690
Yeah. 
Noda was moving well, too.

155
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,510
It's going well.

156
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
Team

157
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
Eikyou

158
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
Senkawa

159
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
1

160
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
2

161
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
3

162
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
4

163
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,300
5

164
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,300
Let's pull ourselves together.

165
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
Um, well...

166
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,160
We'll pull ourselves together, sure.

167
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,950
All right !

168
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,150
Batting first, center
fielder, Kine Ryutarou.

169
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,540


170
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,060
Batting first ?

171
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,230
Batting first ?!

172
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,650
In my baseball,
 I value the lead-off hitter.

173
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,650
The cleanup batter may or may not get a plate appearance in the first inning.

174
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,710
The leadoff batter always gets the most plate appearances.

175
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,620
Be the Ichiro of Senkawa, Kine.

176
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,970
Got it, Coach Ohgi.

177
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,160
All right !

178
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,920
Just kidding.

179
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,390


180
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,980
Hirota !

181
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,130
I love your smile !

182
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,990
Hirota !

183
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,440
Smile, huh ?

184
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,650
That's a problem, Sagawa.

185
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,050
If you want to play baseball at this school, you should do as I tell you.

186
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:05,990


187
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,110
Somebody stole underwear from our volleyball club.

188
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,730
Do you know who might have done it ?

189
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,790
Kine, you're tacky !

190
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,450
Give me back my lunch money, please !

191
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,670
Come on !

192
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,570
Strike !

193
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,260
He's underestimating me !

194
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,060


195
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,630
Strike two !

196
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,580
Dammit...



197
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,590
He's swinging like a cleanup hitter.

198
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,180
I guess he hasn't adjusted
 to his role as lead-off hitter.

199
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,640
He's a proud man,
 like that pitcher, Hirota.

200
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,250
Kine is proud in a 
way that's cute, though.

201
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,020
What's the next pitch ?

202
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,150
It goes without saying.

203
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,430
I'm locking onto a fastball !

204
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,400
Strike ! Batter out !

205
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,450
Humph !

206
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,100
Kine, lunch money !

207
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,900
Hirota !

208
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Amazing !

209
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,600
No one will praise him
 if he overpowers us...

210
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,430
...so he has to beat us while
 humming a song or something.

211
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,620
He can use that as an excuse
 when he gets batted around, too.

212
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,080
He's so easy to understand.

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,250
Yanagi, why don't you
 pounce on the first pitch ?

214
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,810
His pride will get in the way, and 
he'll probably throw a soft fastball.

215
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,220
Good job.

216
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,620
Even in a normal-sized ballpark, it would have directly hit the fence and gone for extra bases.

217
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,650
You're so thoughtless.

218
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,100
When you hit it so well, he won't throw us any more meatballs.

219
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,810
If I were thinking about the future, 
I'd quit baseball and focus on studying.

220
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,630
Impressive.
 He really is wholesome.

221
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,550
I guess I'll name 
our strategy today as...

222
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,050
...the autumn sky, the wholesome look, or something like that.

223
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,550
A homerun off of a tease ball.

224
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,380
But...

225
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,650
You're probably pretty
 worked up, aren't you ?

226
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,480
It won't make it in time.

227
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,080
You shouldn't stay 
that far behind the base.

228
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,400
...

229
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:15,560
Your first step is slow anyway. You should know your range.

230
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,650
Baseball is...

231
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,100
Baseball is a sport where we feel 
the spirit of our eight teammates...

232
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,460
...and the guys on the opposing team 
through the acts of throwing and hitting.

233
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,780
Of course, winning and losing is part of the fun.

234
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,240
But it's more rewarding because we can learn who we all are as people.

235
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,700
Huh ?

236
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Dang !

237
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,620
Damn !

238
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,400
It was a hard-hit ball.

239
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,920
Anyone could've hit that pitch.

240
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,590
You're so confident.

241
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,710
He underestimated Senkawa's cleanup batter's power.

242
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,150
Of course. 
Noda is a great player, too.

243
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,760
They're still feeling
 each other out right now.

244
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,630
I think it's going to 
be an interesting game.

245
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,900
This game is still being played like part of the festivities.

246
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,000
Once Hiro becomes serious...

247
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,550
...he'll start throwing so hard
 that there'll be no stopping him.

248
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,260
That's right.

249
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,200
Team

250
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,200
Eikyou

251
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,200

257
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,560
All right.

258
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,250
Let's pull it together !

259
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,510
Yeah !

260
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,910
Pitch-to-contact, Kunimi ! 
I'll catch it next time !

261
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's play some good defense !

262
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,060
I'm counting on you all !

263
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,100
Man, these guys are 
such wholesome people.

264
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,770
Hello. Hello.
 I'm Kine Ryutarou !

265
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,950
I'm great at soccer, too ! 
Nice to meet you all !

266
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,730
Before you act so endearing, you
 should give me back my lunch money !

267
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,720


268
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,550
Except for one person, that is.

269
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,430
That's not a problem, though.

270
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,550
He hasn't thrown his best stuff yet.

00:22:51,770 --> 00:23:00,080
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

289
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,380
"I'm definitely glad we met."

290
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,200
Let's stay strong and move forward.

291
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,930
When I'm by myself I notice...

292
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,880
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

293
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,680
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

294
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,930
...there are more and more smiles.

295
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,380
Just by looking at you, see ?

296
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,480
My eyes will look kinder.

Next Episode

298
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,810
Hiro, it looks like you're getting away
 with your pitch-to-contact strategy so far.

299
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,610
Yeah, fielding practice is important.

300
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,640
But how much longer can 
you sustain such pitching ?

301
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,090
I'm not flashy like Hirota, who retires the side with three consecutive three-pitch strikeouts.

302
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,810
You're not beneath him.

303
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,450
As long as I finish an inning with 
nine pitches, it's the same, right ?

304
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,020
See ? You don't like to lose.

Are you having a refreshing workout ?
