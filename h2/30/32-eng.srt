Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

15

Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,960
Fall Tournament, the final game.

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,900
Hideo's Meiwa Daiichi is playing against...

18
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,330
...Eikyou High School, which features the ace pitcher, Hirota Katsutoshi.

19
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,170
Hirota declares a strikeout, and then hits Hideo.

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,300
Hideo...

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,300
 Episode 32

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,300
Genius Tachibana

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,300
An At-Bat Full of Spirit

24
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:10,220


25
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,460
Tachibana !

26
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,650
He's more timid than I thought.

27
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,850
He let the ball get away because 
he was scared of Hideo's presence.

28
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,000
But for someone who was scared, he had great arm motion.

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,900
He's right.

30
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,500
Ball three.

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,310
Ball four.

32
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,800
So he pretends to be 
shaken after hitting a batter.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
Strike !

34
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,630
You mean to say he 
did it on purpose ?

35
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,960
No one's saying that.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
There's no evidence.

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,990
 It's something that 
only he himself knows.

38
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,700
Sure Victory ! Eikyou High School

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,210
If he were in bad shape, they'd pinch-run for him.

40
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,170
Do you think Hide-chan would leave the game midway ?

41
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,450
Strike ! Batter out !

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,100
Are you okay, Tachibana ?

43
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,170
I'll never say I can't play.

44
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,410
If you feel I'm not okay, 
please feel free to say so.

45
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,410
Okay then.

46
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,000
Meiwa Ichi

47
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,000
Eikyou

48
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,380
Hirota.

49
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,900
You should keep it to one hit-by-pitch per game.

50
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,230
I got a little tense and 
let the ball get away.

51
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,410
It wasn't on purpose.

52
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,450
Of course not.

53
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,150
But your arm motion 
was the same as always.

54
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,990
It would be bad if people get
 the wrong idea, so be careful.

55
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,130
I understand.

56
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,600
Certain
Victory

57
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,320
Win! Meiwa Nine

58
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,170
Victory for Meiwa!

59
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,400
Meiwa

60
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,400
Good Luck!

61
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,050
Out !

62
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,100
Certain Victory! Eikyou High School

63
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,100
Good Luck

64
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,910
Give It Your Best, Eikyou Nine

65
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,620
They're such high-level performers.

66
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,640
It must feel great to 
coach teams like those.

67
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,850
But if they're this good from the start, it probably doesn't feel as rewarding.

68
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,960
Our team will soon be able to play the game at this level.

69
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,030
Right, Kunimi ?

70
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,580
Where's Kunimi ?

71
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,000
Hey !

72
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,080
I'm getting some food !

73
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
I'll come with you.

74
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,300
What ?

75
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,300
Shall we buy some 
rice crackers for Noda ?

76
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,940
Are you sure we can ?

77
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,600
We have to have him act like a coach from time to time.

78
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:38,940


79
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,380
This is my brother's wallet.

80
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,840
I see.

81
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,700
This time, you're 
buying me one, Hikari.

82
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,490
Okay, sure.

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,770
Go on ahead !

84
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,820
I'm going to take a look !

85
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,680
Foul.

86
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,960
Oh.

87
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,610
Just a foul ball.

88
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,990
Thank you.

89
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,960
What happened ?

90
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,030
It was just a foul ball.

91
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,000
Tomoko, sorry for the wait.

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,860
Here, this one's yours, Kunimi.

93
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,100
Here, this is for you, Hikari.

94
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,200
Hello.

95
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,380
I'm worried about Tachibana.

96
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,150
Yes.

97
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,020
He'll be fine.
 He's a tough guy.

98
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,170
What ?

99
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,230
He'll be fine.
 He's a tough guy, he says.

100
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,250
That's right...

101
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,440
That's right, she says.

102
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,020
Um...

103
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go.

104
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,950
See you.

105
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,150
Bye.

106
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,750
Kunimi !

107
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,300
Did something happen 
between you and Hikari ?

108
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,590
No, not really.

109
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,600
Honestly, it was a hard hit.

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,500
Are you talking about the pitch that hit Tachibana ?

111
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,550
I guess.

112
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,050
Hikari ! Hikari !

113
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,650
Why are you spacing out ?

114
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,490
Tachibana is coming up next.

115
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,370
That's right.

116
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,500
If I were Meiwa's coach, I'd give him this advice.

117
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,100
Return him the favor and hit him good.

118
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,220
It's not that easy. The game has been scoreless so far.

119
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,190
They're playing this
 game at a high level.

120
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Aim for the Koushien

121
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,900
Aim for the Koushien

122
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,800
Such a high caliber performer...

123
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,000
Honestly.

124
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,150
Meiwa Ichi

125
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,150
Eikyou

126
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,270
He'll get another at-bat.

127
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,560
I'll have to make sure that I don't 
get tense and let the ball slip away.

128
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,910
Good job, Tachibana.

129
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,740
Great job, Hideo.

130
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,190
It's amazing.

131
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,320
You're amazing !

132
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,560
Fukui.

133
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,490
Yes ?

134
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,000
You're going in as
 the third baseman.

135
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,920
Okay, Tachibana ?

136
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,380
Yes.

137
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,700
Batter out !

138
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,990
Three outs. Change.

139
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,700
He slammed the door on the rest.

140
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,950
Yeah.

141
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,550
But that run Hideo put
 on the board is huge.

142
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,800
He hits a homerun after
 getting hit by a pitch.

143
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,100
Star players really know 
how to distinguish themselves.

144
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,760
How many swings do you think Hide-chan takes every day, to hit that homerun ?

145
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,460
Meiwa Daiichi High School,
third baseman, Tachibana is out.

146
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,950
Iwakiri

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,950
Shimoike

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,950
Murabe

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,900
Tachibana

150
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,950
Nakai

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,950
Tachikawa

152
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,190
Fukui will replace him.

153
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,950
Fukui

154
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,300
V   Victory

155
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,300
Show Your Mettle

156
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,300
Do Your Best

157
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,820
He would have made one more plate appearance.

158
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,460
Yeah.

159
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,580
Is it because of that hit-by-pitch ?

160
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,150
Who knows ?

161
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,720
Hide-chan !

162
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,150
Hey !

163
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,750
Are you okay ?

164
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,740
It's nothing. Coach told me to go to the hospital and have it looked at, just in case.

165
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,350
I see.

166
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,010
Continue to cheer for the team, okay ?

167
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,700
Strike ! Batter out !

168
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
So cool !

169
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,100
How was Hideo ?

170
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,430
He went to the hospital.

171
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,880
So, how's the game ?

172
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,380
He's been declaring strikeouts every
 time he gets two strikes on a batter.

173
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,650
He's got eleven strikeouts so far.

174
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,000
Strike !

175
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,800
He gets double-digit
 strikeouts on Meiwa...

176
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,480
I wonder whose pitch is faster.

177
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Kunimi's is faster, by far !

178
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,170
Great, huh ? Haruka's eyes
 are biased, but they're good.

179
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,590
Oh, I see.

180
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,900
Strike two !

181
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,870
Strike ! Batter out !

182
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,140
Three outs ! Change !

183
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,400
Ogasawara

184
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,400
Arai

185
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,400
 "Ogasawara, Arai, Hirota, Kokubu, Suzuki"}

186
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,400
 "Ogasawara, Arai, Hirota, Kokubu, Suzuki"}

187
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,400
 "Ogasawara, Arai, Hirota, Kokubu, Suzuki"}

188
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,660
This is such a great game.

189
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,000
Of course !

190
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,900
Meiwa's Ichinose Makoto, 
Eikyou's Hirota Katsutoshi.

191
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,450
They're two of the best lefty ace pitchers in Kantou.

192
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,020
Was Hirota perhaps in Shizuoka when he was in junior high ?

193
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,910
Yeah, that's right.

194
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,510
Coach Shiroyama discovered 
him and recruited him over here.

195
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,010
Coach Shiroyama is amazing. He found an incredible pitcher.

196
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,780
Hirota Katsutoshi...

197
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Meiwa Ichi

198
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Eikyou

199
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,430
Meiwa Ichi

200
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,430
Eikyou

201
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,650
Yeah, it was fine. We won.

202
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,800
More importantly, 
how is your elbow ?

203
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,790
What ?

204
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,140
You kept the powerful Meiwa lineup 
to four hits, and got twelve strikeouts.

205
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,920
Nice pitching, Hirota.

206
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,750
It doesn't mean much if the team loses.

207
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,460
The only run you gave up is the homerun by Tachibana. You came really close.

208
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,650
He totally deceived me.

209
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,950
I guess I didn't have to worry about the effect that my hitting him had.

210
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,190
No, apparently, the examination at the hospital showed that he has a fracture.

211
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,870
He had a fracture and still hit a homerun ? I feel ashamed.




212
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,370
Well, you went easy on him, right ?

213
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,260
That's right. You declared a 
strikeout on him in the first at-bat.

214
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,340
Oh, please give me a break. 
I've told you this many times.

215
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,770
It's just a habit I have, when I try to pull myself together.

216
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,000
The strikeouts are just coincidental.

217
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,430
Oh, don't say that.

218
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,550
More importantly, 
will Tachibana be okay ?

219
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,460
Fortunately, there's plenty of time before the Invitational.

220
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,110
I hope he makes a quick recovery and comes back slugging like he has been.

221
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,990
Otherwise, I'll seem like a villain.

222
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,110
I'm looking forward to your Invitational appearance !

223
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,820
I'll go see your 
game at the Koushien !

224
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,110
I'll go cheer for you !

225
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,570
Thanks for your work !

226
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,250
Hey.

227
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,560
Did you come to cheer
 for your childhood friend ?

228
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,170
I plan to have Hide-chan take
 care of me for a while, after all.

229
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,020
What's the point of telling me that ?

230
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,990
The real bad guys keep quiet and 
smile secretly when no one's watching.

231
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,790
Right ?

232
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,620
Yeah.

233
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,760
See ya.

234
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,750
It's Hirota !

235
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,030
Hirota !

236
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,050
Please look this way !

237
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,190
The real bad guys keep quiet and
 smile secretly when no one's watching.

238
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,820
He's right.

239
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,070
Good luck !

240
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,800
Hirota !

241
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Good luck !

242
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,550
Restroom

243
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,330
I'm going to the bathroom.

244
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,510
Hurry it up.

245
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,240
Okay.

246
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,410
Hi.

247
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,820
It's been a while.

248
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,990
I saw you just a bit ago.

249
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,520
This is the first time we've talked since you slapped me hard in the face.

250
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,310
I mean, whose fault was that ?

251
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,950
It was mine.

252
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,210
That's why I didn't punch you back.

253
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,380
Is Hideo okay ?

254
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,540
He has a fracture.

255
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,570
What ?

256
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,700
I was just told on the phone.

257
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,000
And he still hit that homerun ?

258
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,000
For pitchers,
 he's such a nasty hitter.

259
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,890
Are you waiting for someone ?

260
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,650
Yeah. Tomoko is in the bathroom.

261
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,120
Oh.

262
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,080
Sorry about that.

263
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,800
What ?

264
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,690
I'm telling you, it was my fault.

265
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,900
Umm...but resorting to violence is...

266
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,200
...sometimes necessary, I think.

267
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,260
There are some things you 
don't learn until you're slapped.

268
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,020
What did you learn ?

269
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,500
I learned that Hiro...

270
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,700
What is it ?

271
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,740
...is a good guy.

272
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,550
You want me to slap you again ?

273
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,210
I dare you. Right here !

274
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,170
You little...!

275
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,630
I'm gonna do it ! 
There ! There !

276
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,550
It hurts ! How dare you !

277
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,200
There ! There ! There !

278
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,290
Haruka !

279
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,890
Let's go !

280
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,400
Sure !

281
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,990

I thought with frustration, when I met you.

300
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,630
"I'm definitely glad we met."

301
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,450
Let's stay strong and move forward.

302
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,180
When I'm by myself I notice...

303
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,130
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

304
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,930
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

305
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,180
...there are more and more smiles.

306
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,630
Just by looking at you, see ?

307
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,730
My eyes will look kinder.

Next Episode

309
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,460
You're going to play an invitational game for Senkawa's school festival, right ?

310
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,340
Yeah, against Eikyou, where Hirota, who broke Hideo's arm, plays.



311
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,070
I suppose it's a fated face-off.

312
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,860
It seems something had happened between Sagawa and Hirota, too.

313
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,870
Eikyou's Coach Shiroyama tried to recruit you once, didn't he ?

314
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,260
Anyway, it's just part of the school festival. I'm going to take it easy.

Welcome, Eikyou High School !

319
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,350
Look forward to it !

320
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,700
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
