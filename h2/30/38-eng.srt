00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

Presented by Central Anime

16
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,400
At the fall cultural festival,
 I asked Koga to the folk dance.

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,400
But Hideo's childhood friend, Sagawa...

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,440
...challenged me, saying
 he wanted to hit my pitches.

19
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,060
I got so engrossed in the duel that I
totally forgot about my promise with Koga.

20
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,580
Koga, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,700
 Episode 38

22
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,700
The First Date !

23
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,700
Best Regards to Us for the Future

24
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,250


25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Give It Your Best,
Kunimi Hiro !

26
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm going to go, Third.

27
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,930
Would you like some ice cream ?

28
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,020
Thanks.

29
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,800
Oh, that's right.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,050
I don't need to 
thank you today, do I ?

31
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,700
Certainly, Miss.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm glad that you
 actually came today.

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,930
As I said, I'm sorry.

34
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,690
I just got so engrossed in it.

35
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm not mad.

36
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,500
I did want to do the folk dance with you, though.

37
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,880
Besides, you're going to 
spend the entire day with me.

38
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,100
You're going to pay for everything, 
and you'll do anything I ask, right ?

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,830
Don't ask for too much.
 I have to pay for all this ?

40
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,130
If a cute girl is asking,
 you should do it.

41
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,680
Even if you were cute, 
you're just my kiddy cousin.

42
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,900
Hey, that looks so cute.

43
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,340
Huh ?

44
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,650
Can you buy that for me ?

45
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,210
I just bought you
 a similar one recently.

46
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,000
Why are you looking
 envious, Ryutarou ?

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,530
That's silly. 
Why should I be envious ?

48
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,900
You're right.
 You're with me, after all.

49
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,000
There's no way you'd
 be envious of anyone.

50
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,580
What ? Why with you ?

51
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,000
You're happy, aren't you ?

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,880


53
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,300
Now, Miss. You can tell me 
any of your whimsical wishes.

54
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,310
You can give me any of your whimsical wishes.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,450
My whimsical wish #1.

56
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,230


57
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,500
You really want to ride this ?

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,760
My whimsical wish #2.

59
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,640
Let's not ride in the first row.

60
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,510
#3.

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,360
What ? It's a standing ride ?

62
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,500
#4.

63
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,470
What was that ?
 It was scarier than I thought.

64
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,170
I didn't know that you'd
 get scared so easily.

65
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,090
You don't act that way, 
so I didn't know.

66
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,700
Well, you're considered a great one if you can read the pitcher's mind by just looking at his facial expressions.

67
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, you're considered great if you can read a pitcher's mind just by looking at his face.

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,500
Hey, what are you doing there ?

69
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,200
Hey, popcorn.
Do you want some ?

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,510
You're going to buy me some ?

71
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,250
Of course.

72
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,300
Thank you very much.

73
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,000
Sure.

74
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,290
Kunimi.

75
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,760
You didn't force yourself to come with me, right ?

76
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,400
It was an obligation.

77
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,460
Obligation.

78
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,330
Don't put on an act. 
I know you're having fun.

79
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,400
Hey, how old are you ? How old ?!

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,200
There's no way I could enjoy
 being with a cheeky kid like you !

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,400
Shut up and eat !

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,930
Huh ?

83
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,500
That show of anger is really an expression of love.

84
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,250
I'm happy that it's
 an amusement park.

85
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,050
What ?

86
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,000
Instead of the folk dance, I mean.

87
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,600
Weekdays are great.
 It's not crowded.

88
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Yeah.

89
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,510
Koga.

90
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes ?

91
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,870
The carp here are so gluttonous.

92
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,930
You're right.

93
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,430
Hey.

94
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,120
You're high school 
students, aren't you ?

95
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,400
Yes.

96
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,820
What about school ?

97
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,700
We had a cultural festival on Sunday, so we have an off day today instead.

98
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,130
You're off today ?

99
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,130
Yes.

100
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,050
Fine, then.

101
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,540
Let's go there now.

102
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,700
The surprise house ? Don't be
 surprised by your own face, okay ?

103
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,300
That's mean. 
That goes for you, too.

104
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,030
But really, some of those
 make you look scary.

105
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,000
Nowadays, high school kids should hold hands. You two should, too.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Right ?

107
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,580
Amusement park. It's so joyful.
 Amusement park.

108
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,930
What was that about ?

109
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,640
You know ?

110
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,300
Yeah.

111
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,990
Let go of me.

112
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,300
Don't be bashful. 
We're just holding hands.

113
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,650
I'm not being bashful.

114
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,580
Ryutarou.

115
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,300
You want one ?

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,880
I don't want one. 
Just finish it already.

117
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,990
Oh, man.
 My clothes got sticky, too !




118
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,220
You two.

119
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,690
What happened to school ?

120
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,500
What ?

121
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,240
Well, we have a day off  
because of the cultural festival.

122
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,270
Right ?

123
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,300
One boy ticket and 
one girl ticket, please.

124
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,170
You mean one adult
 and one child, right ?

125
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,420
Why are you so flustered ?

126
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,590
Shut up !

127
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,600
Leaves turning red. Walking while holding hands. The autumn sky.

128
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
That's a great haiku.

129
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,830
What is that about ?

130
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,800
Hey, what's your next whim ?

131
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:39,680
Jumping over the puddles one by one...

132
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,900
I was just trying to think 
of one. My next whim is...

133
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,650
...I want to get past a hardship like that.

134
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,760
Umm, what's the next one ?

135
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,580
It's #23.

136
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,160
You've been counting, Kunimi ?

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,900
I'm just kidding.

138
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:55,200
Like you, I run up the pedestrian bridge...

139
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,840
Is that it ?

140
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,150
No.

141
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm saving that one for last.

142
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:03,150
...keeping up with the sunny sky, I want to feel courageous.

143
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:57,990
Let's go.

144
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,650
"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

145
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,700
I guess we're riding that one, too ?

146
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:18,300
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

147
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,190
It was a mirror, but you
 were acting like it was real.

148
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Kunimi.

149
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,900
"I'm definitely glad we met."

150
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,110
Yeah ?

151
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's stay strong and move forward.

152
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,660
Hmm. 

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,700
When I'm by myself I notice, that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

154
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,410
Hey, it's well-made.

155
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:41,500
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow, there are more and more smiles.

156
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Just by looking at you, see ? My eyes will look kinder.

157
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,800
Hey, Koga.

158
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,940
This one looks interesting, too.

159
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,440
Let's go.

160
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,000
Sure.

161
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,990
Wait up, Kunimi.

162
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,120
Where are you, Kunimi ?

163
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,900
Aim for the Koushien

164
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,970


165
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,850
Aim for the Koushien

166
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,960


167
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,900
No Reentry
Allowed

168
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,230
I can't find him.

169
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,200
What happened to your boyfriend ?

170
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,270
You two lost each other ?

171
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,600
Yes.

172
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,800
That's why I told 
you to hold hands.

173
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,220
A minor cross-up
 leads to the end of love.

174
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,800
Sorry about that.

175
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm telling you.

176
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:45,900
The lost child is a long-haired, lecherous-looking high school boy.

177
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,120
He's totally useless without me.

178
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,230
He's aimless and helpless.

179
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,440
Really, he's such a handful.

180
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,930
Why are you making such a face ?

181
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,700
I was afraid that 
you'd left me behind.

182
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,750
That maybe I asked for too much.

183
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,860
I promised to spend the day with you.

184
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,110
Honestly ?

185
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,230
Honestly. You should have confidence in yourself.

186
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,400
Ring Toss

187
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,400
Three rings per game, 200 yen

188
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,400
The prize of the ring toss must
be completely inside the ring.

189
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,990
Here are the three rings.

190
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,990
That one !

191
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,080
All right.

192
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,710
I wanted to come to
the amusement park.

193
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,360
At an amusement park, we can go back to feeling like children.

194
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,350
I thought I'd be able
to see your everyday self.

195
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,800
Well, it's a date today.
I guess I'm a little tense.

196
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,300
A date ?

197
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,870
Don't repeat what I said.

198
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,080
You're being bashful.

199
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,700
Peerless

200
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,290
You can throw it away.

201
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,650
Why ? I wanted this one.

202
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,970
You've got to be kidding.

203
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,060
I'm being honest.

204
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,370
Well, what's next ?

205
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,920
Shall we go for the one we've saved ?

206
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,620
Sure.

207
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,190
Wow, it's a great view !

208
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,510
I guess so.

209
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,490
Look, Kunimi !

210
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,660
I'll see it later.

211
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,200
Are you afraid of heights ?

212
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,480
A little.

213
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,750
But you said you
 wanted to ride this.

214
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,560
You looked like you wanted to.

215
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,510
Don't move ! 
It's losing balance !

216
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,050
When I first met you, it was spring.

217
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,000
Were you able to burn it ?

218
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,270
Kunimi Hiro.

219
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,040
I'm Koga Haruka, the manager for the Senkawa High School Baseball Club.

220
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,580
It's coming up soon.

221
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,340
What is ?

222
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,250
Look, Kunimi !

223
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,550
To tell the truth, I wanted us to see this together.

224
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,510
What is it ?

225
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,100
You wanted juice ?

226
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,300
Yeah.

227
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,960
Thanks.

228
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,940
It feels good.

229
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,080
Sorry about that.

230
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,890
Since when ?

231
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,180
It's been like this since
 I woke up this morning.

232
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,010
That's stupid ! You should
 have called me and canceled !

233
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,200
No way ! 
It would be such a waste.

234
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
You're paying for everything today.

235
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,950
You're the daughter
 of a company president.

236
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,600
There's no need to be stingy !

237
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,480
I've been looking forward to this, since yesterday.

238
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,780
We're going home.

239
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,550
You promised to 
spend the day with me.

240
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,400
Today isn't the only off day.

241
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,150
If you don't mind splitting the tab, I'll go out with you anytime.

242
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,480
Really ?

243
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,500
Yeah.

244
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,680
Then we'll go home.

245
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,670
In five years, you'll be cuter, even if not as cute as Koga.

246
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,160
It's hot !

247
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,200
What did you do that for ?!

248
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,700
It made a mark on my cheek !

249
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,460
Oh, well.

250
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,690
It's hot.

251
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,130
Koga ?

252
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,200
Oh, pardon me.

253
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,580
Oh.

254
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,380
Could you take a photo of us ?

255
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Today, too.

256
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,650
Romance begins at the amusement park.

257
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,200
And I make happiness.

258
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,250
Too many syllables.

259
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Say cheese.

260
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,400
You shouldn't take
 a photo of us like this.

261
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,990
It's to commemorate our first date.

262
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,150
Oh, well.

263
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,410
I look forward to spending time with you.

281
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:00,130
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

282
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,430
"I'm definitely glad we met."

283
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,250
Let's stay strong and move forward.

284
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,980
When I'm by myself I notice...

285
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,930
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

286
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,730
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

287
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,980
...there are more and more smiles.

288
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,430
Just by looking at you, see ?

289
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,530
My eyes will look kinder.

290
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,480
Next Episode

291
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,980
Hiro, Hide-chan's arm
 is finally out of the cast.

292
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,090
So he's starting his rehab ? He must have lost a fair amount of muscle.

293
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,500
But if he pushes himself too hard, it might set him back.

294
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,180
Then you must be firm and tell him. You shouldn't need to refrain.

295
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,670
But I can't quite say it
 in the way that I want.

296
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,270
If it's Hiro, it's easier.

297
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,170
Next episode of H2 is, 
"The Cast in Your Heart Isn't Gone Yet."

298
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,900
The First Date !

299
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,900
Next episode of H2 is

The Cast in Your Heart Isn't Gone Yet

301
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,900
Look forward to it !

302
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,430
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

303
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,190
