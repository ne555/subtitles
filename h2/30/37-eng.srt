1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,200
Repeating seasons...

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,500
...and accumulating memories.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,350
Like in childhood...

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,700
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,930
When I stumble and look downward...

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,550
Tears flow and shine, but...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,900
Back to the ground

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,700
A smile heals wounded wings.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,730
Back to the ground

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,280
The wind and the earth embrace me.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,150
I don't care what anyone says...

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,850
...because I believe in myself.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Someday, I will come close...

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,100
...to this big, endless dream.

Welcome, Eikyou High School

Senkawa Festival Baseball Club Invitational Game

18
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,090
A culture festival invitational game against Eikyou High School.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,330
The result was a
 definitive loss for Senkawa.

20
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,200
But we're still developing as a team.

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,750
Now, let's go enjoy the culture festival.

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,030

Hiro. Noda.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,850
Good work today.

34
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,300
Good work.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Hey, you two. What did you think of the game ?

36
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,100
For now, I'm looking 
forward to next year.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,520
That's helpful to us, too.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,630
I agree.

39
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,300
You guys are worth
 waiting for, after all.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,400
Hide-chan, it's time.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,090
That's right. Let's go.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,360
Oh, you're leaving ?

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,600
You guys aren't going
 to the folk dance ?

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,650
No. We're going to watch a movie.

45
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,220
We have a free ticket
that expires after today.

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,500
Work hard to find
 a folk dance partner.

47
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,830
If you don't want to
 dance with a guy, that is.

48
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,760
Thanks for your extraneous concern.

49
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,390
See you.

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
I'm envious.

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,970
They'll be holding hands and
 stuff inside a dark movie theater.

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,800
In this day and age, that 
would still be wholesome.

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,940
That's right. They've been together for a long time, so perhaps...

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,790
Perhaps...

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,100
Well, let's find some cute girls.

56
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,070
Sure.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,190
Kunimi, Noda !

58
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,700
Where are you going now ?

59
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,910
It goes without saying.

60
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,650
Right ?

61
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,120
That's right.
 It's none other than the folk dance.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,650
We're preparing to
 go to the folk dance.

63
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,350
What about you ?

64
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,850
My class is doing a café, 
so I'm going to help them.

65
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,850
I see.
Well, we'll get going.

66
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,970
Good work today.

67
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,810
You did great today.

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,730
Good luck with the Spring Koushien !

69
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,890
Well, we don't know
 if we're going yet.

70
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,650
Oh, you're so humble !

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,890
Please go easy on me.

72
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,530
I'm looking forward
to going to high school.

73
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,400
Judging from your hand, it looks you continued to play baseball.

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,100
Just practice swings, to kill time.

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,650
Everyone, I'm sorry, 
you'll have to excuse me.

76
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,510
He's an underclassman
 from my junior high.

77
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,840
Sure. We're looking 
forward to the Invitational !

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Please win the championship.

79
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,870
Bye !

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,560
Bye !

81
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,340
Bye !

82
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,300
As always, you're cautious, Hirota.

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,500
If you want to play baseball, 
I can introduce you to our coach.

84
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,650
Give me a break.

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,550
I don't want to get banned from the 
club again for a crime I didn't commit.

86
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,960
Hey, it wasn't my fault.

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,590
It was something that all of the club 
members decided to do, including the coach.

88
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,660
Well, I guess we'll leave it at that.

89
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,690
Wait, Sagawa.

90
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,200
Looking back on it...

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
...I guess I'm to be blamed for doing 
something that caused a misunderstanding.

92
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,180
I feel sorry for that.

93
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,240
There wasn't a misunderstanding. I think I know you pretty well.

94
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,190
You definitely aren't sorry.

95
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,960
Is that someone you know ?

96
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,600
No.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,300
I see.

98
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,050
I'm sorry that I dragged you into a meaningless game.

99
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,300
Even with Kunimi, those position 
players and the coach are worthless.

100
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,550
You can forget about this team.

101
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,900
That coach's name is Koga, right ?

102
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,650
Yeah, I think that's what it was...

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Hmm ?

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,930
Koga ?

105
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,020
It can't be.

106
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,700
According to my scorebook, it's 3-2.

107
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,440
The famous coach, 
Shiroyama Yoshiaki, huh ?

108
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,570
I doubt he remembers me.

109
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,230
Now, time for the culture festival !

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,990
Senkawa Festival

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Our proud tradition, the Miss Senkawa
 Contest, starts at 4 PM in the gymnasium.

112
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,450
And the main event of the
 Senkawa Festival, the folk dance...

113
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,250
...will be held in the
 schoolyard at 5 PM.

114
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,400
Please join us.

115
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,600
I knew you were from 
Fukutomi High School.

116
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,540
No wonder you look so classy.

117
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,100
Oh, please, I wouldn't say that.

118
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,350
Can I ask you a question ?

119
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,200
Sure.

120
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,900
What's the color of 
your underwear today ?

121
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,340
Huh ?

122
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,400
As always, you're smooth with 
girls you meet for the first time.

123
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,500
What's that supposed to mean ?

124
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,900
This here is a good guy.

125
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,560
He's honest, so he'll show his true self soon enough.

126
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,180
Thanks for that.

127
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,160
Yay.

128
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,380
Oh, well.

129
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,930
So what's the color ?

130
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,800
What ?

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,710
Huh ?

132
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,200
Even though there are so many people here, it's really hard to find a cute girl.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,450
 Men's Bathroom

134
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,500
That's not true. Isn't it because 
you're comparing them to Hikari ?

135
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,060
You shouldn't make her the standard.

136
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,340
Standard...

137
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,150
Whatever it is,
 you're taking a long time.

138
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,700
Shut up.

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,700
Light Meal Café

140
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,700
Coffee

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,700
Tea

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,700
Sandwich

143
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,700
Spaghetti

144

Pilaf

145
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,700
Pork Cutlet Bowl

146
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,120
Thank you for waiting. Please enjoy.

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,650
She might be cute.

148
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you for waiting. Please enjoy.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,060
Haruka !

150
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,450
I'm going to draw some water. Give me a hand.

151
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,260
Okay.

152
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,550
Oh, it's Koga.

153
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,790
What's the matter ?

154
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,870
Nothing.

155
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,870
Then let's go find
 some cute girls !

156
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,570
Yeah.

157
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,740
Let's get fired up !

158
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,500
Yeah.

159
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,980
Wait, Asako !

160
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,400
What are you going to do
 about the folk dance, Haruka ?

161
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,550
I have no interest whatsoever in it.

162
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,020
Kunimi didn't ask you out ?

163
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,270
What ? Why ?

164
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,800
I mean, you guys
 look good together.

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,910
Really ?

166
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,840
Oh, I see. 
Then I might ask out Kunimi.

167
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,400
Huh ?

168
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,270
Phew ! You're making a suspicious face.

169
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,080
Give me a break, Asako.

170
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,650
You look suspicious.

171
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,000
We have to get water and go back there. Everyone's waiting for us.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,970
Sure.

173
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,200
Light Meal Café

174
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Um...

175
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,870
Do you have plans
 for the folk dance ?

176
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,550
Not really. Right ?

177
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,550
Right.

178
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,610
Then won't you join us ?

179
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,510
But...

180
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,470
But...

181
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,100
No ? Let's go together.

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,450
What should we do ?

183
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,080
What should we do ?

184
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,200
It's okay, right ? You said you didn't have plans.

185
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,000


186
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,010
Let's go.
 He's with us, too.

187
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,700
Hey, Hiro. 
You should ask them, too.

188
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,750
Let's go, Yamada.

189
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,570
I'm Kawakami.

190
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:43,960


191
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,250
Please. I'm begging you. Please go out with us !

192
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,460
Huh ?

193
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,930
Please !

194
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,520
What's with that prostrating guy ? 
He's so dorky !

195
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,500
Really !

196
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,810
And the other one is totally spacing out. He's a waste of good looks.

197
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,340
Are you actually trying ?

198
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,030
What do you mean ?

199
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,000
What are you talking about ?

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,750
The key to successful flirting is to be aggressive, you know ?

201
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,510
They say that the casual style works better these days.

202
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,300
Let's part here.

203
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,800
If I stay with you, I have the feeling that I really will end up dancing with a guy.

204
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,870
I see.

205
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,900
Good luck.

206
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,680
To you, too.

207
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,640


208
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,800
Aim for the Koushien

209
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,040


210
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,750
Aim for the Koushien

211
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,700
Light Meal Café

212
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,450
Welcome.

213
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,500
Welcome.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,630
Welcome.

215
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,650
Coffee.

216
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,470
Sure.

217
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,900
Hey, Kunimi !

218
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,260
Do you know where Koga is ?

219
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,800
She's not here ?

220
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,700
I can't find her here or anywhere !

221
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,690
The selection of Miss
 Senkawa is starting soon !

222
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,240
She was selected as one of the ten finalists from the preliminary contest the other day !

223
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,650
Oh.

224
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,000
I need her to participate, Kunimi !

225
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,970
You need me ?

226
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,580
Idiot !

227
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,550
Oh, crap !

228
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,670
Koga, where did you go ?

229
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,970
Koga !

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,900
Is that girl going to be in the 
Miss Senkawa Contest, too ?

231
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,080
You mean the girl we saw on the rooftop just now ?

232
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,030
Yeah, I'm sure she will.

233
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,980
She was the cutest among the girls I saw today.

234
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,650
First Year, Class B, Miss Koga Haruka.

235
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,900
Please come to the Miss Senkawa Contest Committee Waiting Room immediately.

236
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,300
I repeat.

237
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,200
First Year, Class B, Miss Koga Haruka.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh ?

239
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,300
Please come to the Miss Senkawa Contest Committee Waiting Room immediately.

240
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,570


241
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't catch cold, Manager.

242
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm fine. 
It's actually warm inside.

243
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,410
You're not confident ?

244
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,500
About what ?

245
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,750
Miss Senkawa.

246
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:25,770


247
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,190
I'm not participating. Never.

248
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,600
Why not ?

249
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
It's an honor for a girl, I guess.

250
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,400
It's a mockery to rank
 girls based only on looks.

251
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't like it, 
and that won't change.

252
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
Sorry about that.

253
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,170
About what ?

254
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,220
I voted for you in the preliminary, too.

255
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,190
Being dutiful is an important quality.

256
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,790
Yeah. You help us out
 all the time, after all.

257
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,880
Are you sure you're not cold ?

258
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,090
I'm fine.

259
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,880
I see.

260
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,890
Can I come get you when the folk dance starts ?

261
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,500
I don't have a partner.

262
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,800
What are you talking about ?

263
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,650
You'll be fine, Kunimi.

264
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,670
You can ask anyone,
and most girls will say yes.

265
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,120
That's a "yes," then ?

266
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,510
Huh ?

267
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,290
I can wait for you here ?

268
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,350
Yeah.

269
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,020
You really aren't cold ?

270
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,630
No. Not at all.

271
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,600
Can you come with me ?

272
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,120
I won't take up too much time.

273
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,900
Can you pitch to me ?
 I want to bat against you.

274
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,600
I'm sorry to say. We don't have a 
batting center at our culture festival.

275
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
It's a no ?

276
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,120
How about three
 pitches for 100 yen ?

277
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,490
And if you put it in play, 
I'll pay you 200 yen.

278
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,200
If it's a hit, it'll be 1000 yen.

279
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,500
You sure are confident.

280
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,940
Oh, come on.
 It's just modest confidence.

281
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,400
I didn't say I'd pay 10,000 yen.

282
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,040
Do you want to try ?

283
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,310
With pleasure.

284
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,010
Stay low and keep 
your eyes on the ball.

285
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,300
Oh !

286
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,150
There !

287
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,410
What're you doing here ?

288
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,300
After the game, 
it's free time, right ?

289
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,140
Yeah, we're free, 
so we're practicing.

290
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,150
It's the culture festival today.
 You should...

291
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,320
I told them that, too, but...

292
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,550
Well, we let you down
so many times today.

293
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,040
We felt responsible, so 
I didn't feel like playing around.

294
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,060
I feel sorry for Yanagi, 
but we had him coach us.

295
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,830
But maybe it's meaningless...

296
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,300
If we practice hard,
 we might improve, right ?

297
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,870
Or is it useless...?

298
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,100


299
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
So what brings you here, Kunimi ?

300
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah.

301
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,790
This is Tachibana Hideo's childhood friend, Sagawa.

302
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,100
He'll join our baseball club next year.

303
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,120
Right ?

304
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,180
I'm on the borderline for Senkawa, so I might not make it in.

305
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,770
That depends on 
how hard you work.

306
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,610
Right ?

307
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,360
You want me to make you feel 
like you want to work hard, right ?

308
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,240
Yanagi, count my pitches.

309
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,280
Here I go !

310
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,140
Repeating seasons.

311
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,570
And accumulating memories.

312
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,170
Like in childhood...

313
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,770
...I want to believe that I can freely fly in the sky.

314
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,520
When I stumble and look downward...

315
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,780
...tears flow and shine, but...

316
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,690
Back to the ground.

317
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:23,790
A smile heals the wounded wings.

318
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,570
Back to the ground.

319
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:33,900
The wind and the earth embrace me.

320
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,850
Aren't his pitches faster than they were in the game ?

321
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,730
Yeah. He shouldn't be so 
competitive against a junior high kid.

322
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,910
He's going to lose his confidence...

323
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,970
No, if he goes easy, he'll be hit hard.

324
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,300
What ?

325
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:53,700
Sitting on the shoreline that I'm supposedly used to seeing.

326
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,100
If you put it in play, 
you get 200 yen, you know ?

327
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,700
It's so beautiful...

328
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,550
That's right.

329
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,310
...I'm surprised at myself for feeling cleansed.

330
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,790
He's not giving up.

331
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,000
I still remember the smell...

332
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,120
Yanagi, what's the next pitch ?

333
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,650
It's 45.

334
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,800
45 divided by 3...

335
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,650
...of the rusted, old school building, so...

336
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,320
...equals 1500 yen !

337
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,450
Back to the ground.

338
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:24,520
Regaining the innocence and purity, that was disappearing from me.

339
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,250
That was disappearing from me

340
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,600
Back to the ground.

341
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:26,860
He did it !

342
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,800
The nostalgic warmth...

343
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,550
...keeps encouraging me now.

344
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,640
Okay. 1500 minus 1000. You can pay 500 yen.

345
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,190
It's a double.

346
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,240
What ?

347
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,100
It's worth two hits.

348
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,660
Moron. You can't reach
 second base with that.

349
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,980
I can.

350
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,290
For me, it's a double.

351
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay then.

352
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,910
In exchange, you've got to get
 admitted here and prove it to us.

353
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,810
Oh, the folk dance 
seems to have started.

354
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,250
That's right.

355
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,500
Oh...!

356
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,650
Hmm ?

357
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,910
Um, if you like, would
 you dance with me ?

358
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,390
Huh ?

359
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,800
Ugh !

360
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,080
Achoo !

361
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,200
Achoo !

Nimbly jumping over a puddle...

366
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,500
...I want to get past a hardship like that.

Like you, I run up the pedestrian bridge...

370
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:38,760
Notes:
Shuu getting into Senkawa: Shuu is talking about his projected exam score. He's saying that his projected score is borderline for Senkawa, so he might or might not be admitted.

Pitch count on blackboard: Yanagi counting by using a kanji,
 which is made of five strokes and is often used
 for counting numbers.

371
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,730
...keeping up with the sunny sky, I want to feel courageous.

372

Notes:


373
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:51,450
"How does he keep such a nice facial expression ?"

379
00:22:51,770 --> 00:23:00,080
I thought with frustration, when I met you.

380
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,380
"I'm definitely glad we met."

381
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,200
Let's stay strong and move forward.

382
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,930
When I'm by myself I notice...

383
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,880
...that, beyond this dazzling feeling...

384
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,680
...yesterday, today, and tomorrow...

385
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,930
...there are more and more smiles.

386
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,380
Just by looking at you, see ?

387
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,480
My eyes will look kinder.

388
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,430
Next Episode

389
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,550
Hiro, you're going out 
on a date with Haruka ?

390
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,330
It's because I missed the folk dance.

391
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,810
You're going to do
 anything she wants ?

392
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,450
Just one day, though.

393
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,970
I wonder what will 
happen on a date with Hiro.

394
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,720
You've got to be a good escort.

395
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,580
I know.

396
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,030
Next episode of H2 is, "The First Date ! 
Best Regards To Us For The Future."

397

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,300
The First Date !

399
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,300
Best Regards To Us For The Future

400
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,300
Look forward to it !

401
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,160
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

402
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,210
