2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,020
The practice game between us Senkawa and Meiwa Daiichi...

13
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,930
...where if we win, we become an official club, and if we lose, we'll be disbanded...

14
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,150
...began with a promise we made with our principal.

15
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,270
We fought hard to the end of the
game in the bottom of the ninth inning.

16
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,820
And we lost.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,300
We lost the game...

18
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,800
...but the Senkawa Baseball Club was born.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,060
That's right, the story of love between me and baseball begins now.

 Episode 20

22
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,850
Pursuit ! Hiro vs. Haruka

23
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,500


24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,300
Koushien

25
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,100
Senkawa

26
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,100
Takamori

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
The game is set.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,600
In their first appearance at the Koushien, Senkawa High School wins its first game.

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,150
Kunimi did it !



30
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,000
The score is 7 - 6. It's their
first victory at the Koushien !

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,340
7 - 6...

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,180
Since it's a dream, it should let me win more decisively.

33
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,550
Ouch...

34
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,210
You should have a
doctor take a look at it.

35
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,350
Some place that isn't a 
quack clinic like Uetake's was.

36
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,250
You finally have a baseball club, and your elbow is fine.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,900
I guess I really do need to
have a doctor take a look at it.

38
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,880
Hmm...

39
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,210
Hmm...

40
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,500
Nice shot !

41
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,140
Wow, amazing ! 
You're single, right ?

42
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,360
Well, yes.

43
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,760
Kunimi, it's my turn.

44
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,240
Oh, I'm sorry, President.

45
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,000
Huh...?

46
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,290
Oh, the daughter of President Koga...

47
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,100
Um, is Kunimi home ?

48
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm here.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, you mean my stupid son.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
He's out right now.

51
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,780
I see.

52
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,700
Did he do anything rude ? Like touching your chest or being a peeping tom ?

53
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,760
No, I'm worried about his leg injury.

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,650
My father knows the doctors at the university hospital...

55
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,500
...so I wanted him to have a thorough examination there.

56
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,910
Injury ?

57
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,400
Is he injured ?

58
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,230
Do you know where he went ?

59
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,010
I have no idea.

60
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,590
But rest assured. He definitely
 comes home when it's mealtime.

61
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,650
To make sure that happens...

62
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,650
...I don't give him any extra 
allowance so he can't eat out.

63
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,650
Hey, Hikari ! Let me 
borrow your bicycle for...

64
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,770
I'm sorry. Hikari is at
archery club practice.

65
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,970
Oh, this ?

66
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,800
I borrowed it to keep
the dust out of my hair.

67
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,700
Does it look good on me ?

68
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,890
Oh, wait.

69
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,300
Can you deliver this to her ?

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,900
She made her lunch box, 
but forgot to take it with her.

71
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,690
This is hers,
and this is Hide-chan's.

72
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,250
Please. 
I'd really appreciate it.

73
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,700
Senkawa Private High School

74
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,040
Well, first years, Kunimi and Noda. That should be everyone.

75
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,080
Hm ?

76
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,430
Umm, who are you ?

77
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm Yanagi, a first year.
Yanagi Morimichi.

78
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,150
Yanagi.

79
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,600
Well, that should be everyone.

80
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,290
Nice to meet you all.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
We welcome you.

82
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, we're still missing one more person. That guy who caught a cold isn't here.

83
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,750
Yanagi here is the son
of our school's principal.

84
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,050
In junior high, he was the well-regarded second baseman at Kita Junior High.

85
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,250
Since the principal hates baseball, he 
was told to quit baseball after junior high.

86
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,300
So he played the game against 
Meiwa without telling the principal.

87
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,970
He was the "guy who caught a cold,"
 wearing a mask and hiding his face.

88
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,100
Oh !

89
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,700
Hey, Baseball Clubi !

90
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,940
What's this "clubi" thing ?

91
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,900
You're not a baseball 
club yet, so it's "clubi."

92
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,560
How about it ? My jokes are 
funnier than ever today, aren't they ?

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,900
Right ? Right ? Right ?

94
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,730
Where's Kunimi ?

95
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,280
He's off today.

96
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,900
He's off ? What ?

97
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,100
I went out of my way to 
participate in your practice...

98
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,300
...as I go between the soccer club and the baseball club.

99
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,680
He must be at the hospital.

100
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,960
What ? He injured himself ?

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,760
Then I'm the only one who can be the ace pitcher.

102
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,440
All right.

103
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,840
Now, let's start pitching practice.

104
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
Next one, please.

105
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,340
Sure.

106
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,240
Even when the pitcher moves that much
 closer to the plate, he hits them easily.

107
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,100
That practice game wasn't a waste. Rather, it yielded a huge harvest.

108
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,260
Kunimi Hiro...

109
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes. Hikari is at 
the top of her game.

110
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,930
Sir, that's the dressing room.

111
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,610
I saw you.

112
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,870
I didn't do anything
to feel guilty about.

113
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,400
Oh, you brought them ?
I forgot to bring them.

114
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,120
Oh, geez.
I worry about your future.

115
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,800
What kind of future
are you talking about ?

116
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,490
After you get married, I mean.

117
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll be fine.

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
...even if I forget my lunch box...

119
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,170
...I'll get a husband who will always deliver it to me with a smile.

120
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,070
There is no such husband.

121
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,100
See ya later.
I'm done with the delivery.

122
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,000
Thanks.

123
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,400
Oh, Hiro, you went to the hospital 
and had your leg looked at, right ?

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm going there now.

125
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,800
You've hated going to the hospital ever since you were little. You need to go.

126
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,600
That's why you were
 deceived by that quack.

127
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,500
An elbow made of glass that will break down in three months.

128
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,400
But thanks to that phony diagnosis...

129
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,030
...people can watch the match of the century between me and Hideo for the next two years.

130
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,040
All baseball fans 
across the nation, I mean.

131
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,350
So look forward to it !
By Kunimi Hiro.

132
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,750
Was that Hiro ?

133
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,980
Yeah. He brought
 us our lunch boxes.

134
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,480
I included your favorite,
kinpira-style sautÃ©ed burdock.

135
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,260
I put in a lot of
time preparing it.

136
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,770
Let's eat.

137
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,910
Come to think of it, Hiro likes
kinpira-style sautÃ©ed burdock, too.

138
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,440
Thanks for the meal.

139
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,090
Eh ?

140
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm really aiming
for the Koushien !

141
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,050
eyecatch

142
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,400
Well, what can I say ?

143
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:40,080
Even if he's stupid, he has the baseball 
talent that he inherited from his father.

144
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,590
From his father, meaning me, Kunimi Tarou, of the third section of the Sales Department.

145
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,800
It's fine.
He'll be home by lunchtime.

146
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,550
He's not home yet.
This is strange.

147
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,540
Um, I'll go look for him.

148
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,780
...

149
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,100
Take care ! Please give
 my regards to the President.

150
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,670
I'm Kunimi Tarou of the third
section of the Sales Department.

151
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,400
Let's see. 
That hospital is far away.

152
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,200
Katou Clinic

153
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,030
Well...I should pass on this one.

154
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Yamazaki Clinic

155
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Internal
Medicine

156
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Gastroenterology

157
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Surgical 
Department

158
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Orthopedic
Department

159
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Weekdays

160
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Saturday

161
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,260
I prefer someone slimmer.

162
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,500
Koide...

163
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,890
Oh ?

164
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,610
I want someone bustier.

165
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,200
Mr. Kunimi.

166
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Oh, Hikari.
It's hot again today, isn't it ?

167
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,970
Did Hiro actually go to the doctor ?

168
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,100
Well, that cursed boy
is currently missing...

169
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,330
...even though the President's
daughter came by car to pick him up.

170
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,730
The President's daughter ?

171
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,790
Yeah, she's the manager, and her hair is shorter than yours.

172
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,910
You mean Koga ?

173
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,900
Yeah, that's right.

174
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,600
That moronic son doesn't understand the position his parent is in...

175
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
...so it really makes me worry.

176
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,150
I see. She's daughter of the president of the Koga Trading Company.

177
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:13,010
If he does something rude to her and the President hears about it, I'll be fired in a jiffy.

178
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,810
You'll be fine.

179
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,500
It's more likely you'll get
 promoted because of Hiro.

180
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,070
I don't think you need to 
worry about getting fired.

181
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,880
Seriously ?

182
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,150
Oh, I found him.

183
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,340
Stop here.

184
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,590
Kunimi !

185
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,200
Hi.

186
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,010


187
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,700
Did you go to the doctor ?

188
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,510
Um, no, I'm going there now.

189
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,260
Then let's go.
I know a reliable doctor.

190
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,810
Hey, wait. The bicycle...

191
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,400
I'll drop you off here on the way home.

192
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,500
Don't worry about it.
I'll find a hospital myself.

193
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,050
That's not good.

194
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,300
You need to have it properly
looked at by a reliable doctor.

195
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,900
The baseball club was finally created.

196
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,000
If anything happens to our
ace pitcher now, it'll be a problem.

197
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,210
Then if you tell me the name and location of that hospital, I'll go there myself.

198
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,740
I'm not a child.

199
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,650
No.

200
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,070
Why ?

201
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,210
I'm the "manager" of the baseball club.

202
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,360
The manager needs to be able to 
manage their player's health conditions.

203
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,400
But you're not my personal manager.

204
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,450
...!

205
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,820
This time, it's not a miss.

206
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,350
Sweets CafÃ©,
Kuromitsuya

207
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,200
Hey !

208
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,610
I remember eating shaved ice here when I was little.

209
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,740
Huh ?

210
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,720
Well, it feels so nostalgic !

211
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,310
No. I know that this cafÃ© has a door on the other street.

212
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,530
Oh, U...

213
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,730
There's a UFO flying out there, right ?

214
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
The sky is blue !

215
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,670
Oh ?

216
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,890
What ?

217
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,040
Hey, wait up !

218
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,350
Hm ?

219
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,450
No matter how I look at it, 
this is my bicycle.

220
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
That means...

221
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,780
Kunimi, you must listen to what your manager says !

222
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,390
What an incorrigible guy.

223
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:00,590


224
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,560
Ouch...

225
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,250
Thanks. I'm not injured.
 I have a band-aid.

226
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,790
Nice job !

227
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,650
Now, Kunimi, your 
futile resistance is over.

228
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,600
Let's go to the hospital.

229
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,840
I'm telling you,
 I can go there by myself.

230
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,210
No.

231
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,160
...!

232
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,240
Freeze, Hiro !

233
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,900
If you move, I'll shoot you.
There's an arrow that's aimed at you.

234
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,000
You should listen to your manager, and go to the hospital with her.

235
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,720
Got it ?

236
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,250
Father, Mother, I surrender.

237
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,460


238
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,990
Well, if he can run like that, 
there's probably no need to worry.

239
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,040


240
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,200
My leg is fine, I think.

241
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,050
No, it's not about that.

242
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,530
Did you actually think
 Hikari would shoot you ?

243
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,100
If she actually had an arrow, yeah, she might just do it.

244
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,400
She's always been like
that since she was little.

245
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,530
What are you angry about ?

246
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,800
It's nothing.

247
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,650
Aim ! Right ?

248
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,800
I'm sorry to say...

249
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
...but it's just a bruise.

250
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:43,200

252

There's no bone or ligament damage.

253
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,100
It should heal in a few days, but just in case, follow up with me again.

254
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,500
Do you want to come in ?

255
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Oh ?

256
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,080


257
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,220

269
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:29,630
Notes:
Clubi Joke: In the Japanese alphabet, the sound "bu" that ends the word "club" comes after "bi,"
 as in "ba bi bu be bo." So before the club becomes a club [or "kurabu"], it is "clubi" [or "kurabi"].  To make the joke work in English you can see what we had to do.

270
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,530
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,980
The star I'm watching today...

279
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,460
...glistened yesterday.

280
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,080
In the town full of things that disappear...

281
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,210
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

282
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:06,160
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

283
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:14,310
...rather than losing our time to regret.

284
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,710
Happiness is not something...

285
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,540
...that someone does for me.

286
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:31,110
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

287
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,100
Kunimi, do you regret 
introducing Hikari to Tachibana ?

288
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,090
What ? Don't ask me 
such a startling question.

289
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,740
I just wanted to ask.

290
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,900
Ocean. Sky. 
Sudden evening rain shower !

291
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,550
Ah, it's summer !

292
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,300
You like summer ?

293
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,360
Yeah, my mind is occupied by thoughts of going to the Koushien next summer !

294
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,330
We're going to the Koushien, right ?

295
