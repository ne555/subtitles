00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,440
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,250

Play !

20
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,250
I'm counting on you...

21
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,040
...my best friend.

22
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,550
Thank you.

23
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,000
Dang. I feel humble.

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,900
The Hakusan Angels'
cleanup hitter is impressive.

25
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,650
There sure are talented
players in this world.

26
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,710
Oh, gosh.

27
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,020
Talented players, huh ?

28
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,720
You don't have to be disappointed.

29
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,700
It's totally understandable that you feel uneasy...

30
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,360
...when a lousy pitcher like that is the ace pitcher.

31
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,300
You don't have to worry. He was the ace pitcher until yesterday.

32
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm the new ace pitcher, Kunimi Hiro.

33
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,240
Nice to meet you.

34
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,750
Ouch.

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,500
You just thought, "What kind of rubbish
is this midget talking about ?" didn't you ?

36
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,600
You can't be a first-rate hitter while 
people can still read your mind so easily.

37
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,720
Aw.

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,280
You just thought,
"What a noisy midget," didn't you ?

39
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,850
...!

40
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,550
You just thought, "You bastard, I'm going to beat you up !" didn't you ?

41
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,060
If you face the two of us,
we can easily outwit you.

42
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,820
You're not the only one who's been given a gift from heaven, Tachibana Hideo.

43
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,890
I always hit the ball that I'm going for, no matter how fooled I am.

44
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,000
Remember that, you midget.

45
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,030
You just thought, 
"He one-upped me." didn't you ?

46
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,000
You just thought, "Ah, how
 nice it is to vent !" didn't you ?

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,970
Huh...?

48
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,760
Foul !

49
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,600
This is the first time.

50
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,940
What ?

51
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,140
A real face-off between
 Hiro and Hide-chan.

52
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,360
You're putting on such a 
powerful swing, best friend.

53
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,100
As always, you're stubborn.

54
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,000
Here.

55
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,080
I feel like this game is why
I've been playing baseball.

56
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,650
You must be imagining things.

57
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,080
This is just a worthless practice game, so let's settle down, okay ?

58
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,500
You rascal !

59
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,070
Foul !

60
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,300
Hey now. What are you 
aiming for with that swing ?

61
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,740
With that swing, you mean to say that you won't be happy with just getting a hit ?

62
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,930
If I just aim for a single, I feel like I'll be late on the swing.

63
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,650
Oh, come on now.

64
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,000
Moron ! Don't call
 for such a stupid pitch !

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,700
Just set up right down the middle !

66
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,000
Crap.

67
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right. He has his strikeout pitch, the 140 km forkball.

68
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,150
That moron. The count is 0-2, with no runners on.

69
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,700
With nothing to lose, it would
have been an interesting pitch.

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,470
Here it comes, Hideo !

71
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,470
Hit it if you can !

72
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,560
Oh, crap !

73
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,760
The 140 km forkball ! Damn him !

74
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,000
If it's a single, I'll take it.

75
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,310


76
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,330
You won't make it, Kine !
Don't dive !

77
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,630
Shut up ! I'm going to catch 
that guy's hit even if it kills me !

78
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,050
Oh ?

79
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,000
On this field, if it goes over the
fielder's head, it usually ends up as...

80
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,820
...an inside-the-park homerun.

81
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:31,960


82
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,790
The score is finally tied !

83
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,560
You shouldn't be happy with a tie.

84
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,400
Ball.

85
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,790
He'll be fine.

86
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,800
Ball.

87
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,230
Is he fine ?

88
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,190
Ball.

89
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,960
Losing command of his pitches after an error ?
I suppose he still has some growing up to do.

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,960
I suppose he still has some growing up to do.

91
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,900
He's not that delicate.

92
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,560
Timeout.

93
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,030
Hey, what were those pitches about ?

94
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,790
It's strange. It made the perfect dive when I pitched it to Hideo.

95
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,740
Right ?

96
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,970
It's not "right ?" Just forget about your fluky forkball !

97
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,710
The score is tied now !
And you have to face Hideo again !

98
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,650
This is no time to 
be fooling around !

99
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,200
If we lose this game, we won't even be able to play catch at Senkawa !

100
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,730
You're right.

101
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,020
Three outs ! Change !

102
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,050
Good job keeping it to one run.

103
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,010
Well, don't worry. If you give up a run, we just need to score a run.

104
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,530
Now, the cleanup is 
coming up this inning.

105
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,090
Let's get fired up !

106
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
I see.

107
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,880
If we give up a run,
 we just need to score a run.

108
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,200
Safe.

109
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
All right !

110
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,250
This world is made perfect !

111
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,680
Stars always get a chance to shine !

112
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,900
Don't overswing, Kine.

113
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,680
Come on !

114
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,390
He's not listening.

115
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:43,400


116
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,380
Strike.

117
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,910
Strike two.

118
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,010
Damn...

119
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,930
Just as I thought, 
he didn't listen to me.

120
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,500
Dammit...

121
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,250
Dammit...

122
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,000
Dammit...

123
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,550
Dammit...

124
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,450
Dammit...

125
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,680
EYECATCH

126
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,970
Oh.

127
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,830
He pulled off a sacrifice bunt.

128
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,700
What is it ?

129
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,650
I just haven't had 
enough batting practice.

130
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,100
If not for the hiatus, I would've
had no trouble with those pitches.

131
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,140
Leave the rest to me, Kine.

132
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,020
I'm not counting on it.

133
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,490
Even if we don't score here, this will give Hiro another at-bat in the ninth.

134
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,700
Yes.

135
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:51,410
Hide-chan says that he had more homeruns and a higher batting average in junior high...

136
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,750
...but in terms of walkoff hits, Hiro had more.

137
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,100
In the ninth inning, Hiro is the
most dependable player, he says.

138
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,560
All right !

139
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,030


140
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,190
Uh-oh.

141
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,860
Uh-oh.

142
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,430
A double play. No runners left.

143
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,900
That means...

144
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,480
...what it means.

145
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,200
Hey, Hide !

146
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,400
It's okay to play hard, but you 
should show some humanity here.

147
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,100
No one would complain if 
you couldn't catch that ball !

148
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,350
You know better than me 
how dutiful Hiro is, don't you ?

149
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,650
I shouldn't do him any favors here...

150
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,430
...if we're to play a fair and even game that decides who will go to the Koushien in the future.

151
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,600
Oh, well.

152
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,810
More importantly...

153
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,910
Is it really just today that 
you're going to root for Hiro ?

154
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,460
You're so obnoxious.

155
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,570
Sorry.

156
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,550
He's such a great guy.

157
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,260
What ?

158
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,400
Tachibana, I mean.

159
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,630
Oh.

160
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,860
He's a little stubborn, though.

161
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,510
How long have you been
going out with him ?

162
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,750
Let's see.

163
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,750
We got introduced to one another
by Hiro in our first year of junior high.

164
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,070
After that, we started to go watch movies
and have a cup of tea together on off-days.

165
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,800
Since your first year of junior high...

166
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,440
Hide-chan was already popular then.

167
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,000
He was athletically talented, and he looked cool.

168
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,000
Here.

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,870
And as you started to go out with him, you found that his merits went beyond his looks.

170
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,990
Right.

171
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,740
You have good luck with the lottery.

172
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,600
In my case...

173
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,800
...guys who looked cool all turned out to be blanks with nothing beyond good looks.

174
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,850
I've never drawn a hit.

175
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,010
First you need to correct 
your careless personality.

176
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,600
You grab one in haste, and that's how you draw a miss.

177
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,260
Kunimi, have you drawn a "hit" ?

178
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,400
In my case, the tickets were sold out.

179
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,450
This time, you probably didn't draw a miss.

180
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,560
Huh ?

181
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,980
A love letter to Hiro ?

182
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,320
Are you serious ?

183
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,810
Hiro.

184
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,000
Wait, Hikari.

185
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,610
Look, I've caught up with you in height.

186
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,000
Told you so !

187
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,590
There's no need to rush !
Just be steady !

188
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,450
Out !

189
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,550
Good job !

190
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,250
All right !

191
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,100
He was short...

192
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,350
Until the second year of junior high, I was a snot-nosed midget.

193
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:28,650
Finally, my height caught up, and I started to think about maybe looking for a girlfriend...

194
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,150
...but all the girls that interested me were in the midst of their first love.

195
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,290
What is it ?

196
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,240
Um, well, nothing.

197
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,340
All right ! Go !

198
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,700
Out !

199
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,500
Do you really want 
to disband this team ?

200
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,500
I made this promise
to make that happen.

201
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,120
It's hot.

202
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,390
It's summer.

203
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,810
Strike ! Batter out !

204
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,190
All right ! 
All that's left is the ninth inning !

205
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,100
Now, it's getting interesting, Koga !

206
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,560
...!

207
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,360
Team

208

Senkawa

210
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,490
It'll be a problem if your team loses.

211
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,410
If we win, we'll be a baseball club. If we lose, we'll be disbanded.

212
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,140
So what happens if it's a tie ?

220
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:29,850
Notes:
Meiwa Principal saying he'd shave his head: "Shaving head" is a gesture of becoming a monk, i.e. abandoning the worldly ambitions and going into the path of religion.

221
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:32,750
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

222
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:36,680
Notes:


223
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:40,600

 sound further and further away.

229
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,200
The star I'm watching today...

230
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,680
...glistened yesterday.

231
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,300
In the town full of things that disappear...

232
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,430
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

233
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:06,410
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

234
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:14,530
...rather than losing our time to regret.

235
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,930
Happiness is not something...

236
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,760
...that someone does for me.

237
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:31,330
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

238
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,590
It's a tie game after the eighth inning.
Meiwa will come after you with all they've got.

239
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,410
It's my second match-up against Hideo. If only I can get him out...

240
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,450
Overconfidence can be very dangerous. Hide-chan isn't your only opponent.

241
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,940
See ? A hard-hit ball hits Hiro's leg.

242
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,100
That scared me. I thought for a moment that it hit Kunimi's leg.

243
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,000
It did.

244
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,330
What ? That's not good !

245
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,300
This isn't a big deal.

246
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,160
Next episode of H2 is "Hiro is Injured ?! 
What Will the Baseball Fan Club Do ?"

247
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,570
Next episode of H2 is

248
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,570
Hiro is Injured !?

249
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,570
What Will the Baseball Fan Club Do ?

250
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,570
Look forward to it !

251
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,550
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

252
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,450
