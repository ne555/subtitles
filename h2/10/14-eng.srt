2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,440
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,200

The Second-String is Playing

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Let's have a family outing !
Outdoor vacation

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
The Forest House Lodge

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Travel Friend' Extra Issue

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,500
Don't act tough just
because you're big !

19
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,730
Soon, I'll be as big as you !

20
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,390


21
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,580
Hey, don't laugh, Hikari !

22
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,370


23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,500
Oh, come on.
What could Mother be doing ?

24
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,900
This is the day of destiny, where 
Senkawa High School's Baseball Fan Club...

25
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,210
...will play a game that decides whether it 
will become an official club or be disbanded.

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,900
Meiwa Daiichi High School

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,690
He's his usual self, it seems.

28
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,610
Hey, Fune.

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,410
Did you see my wallet 
somewhere around here ?

30
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,640
You little...

31
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,840
I steal bases, 
I don't steal wallets.

32
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,560
That's great and all.

33
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey, Kunimi !

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,520
Fune ?

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,960
Don't you dare give 
up any hits to him !

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,600
We have to win this game no matter what kind of hand we're dealt !

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,430
Got that ?

38
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,800
But I can only deal 
with this hand of mine.

39
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,010
Hey, Hiro !

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,150
Is Yanagi here yet ?

41
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,740
It doesn't look like it.

42
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,560
What do you mean,
 "It doesn't look like it" ?

43
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,200
What're we going to
do if he doesn't come ?

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,910
Who's going to play second base ?

45
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,200
Shut up.

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,700
That's the same line I've been
repeating in my head for a while now.

47
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,630
Just as I feared, he just can't disobey his father.

48
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,800
So, who do we have available ?

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's see...

50
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,030
Satou, Tanaka, Sasaki, Nakamura, and...

51
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,600
Oh, did you catch a cold ?

52
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,020
The guy with a cold.

53
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,710
Huh ?

54
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,300
Amamiya

55
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,300
I'm home.

56
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,890
So, Hikari, which one
are you pulling for ?

57
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,000
It goes without saying.

58
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I'll get going.

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,230
It goes without saying ?

60
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,400
Hm ?

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,700
They're underestimating us.

62
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,840
They're playing the second-string.

63
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,040
That's great for us.

64
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,050
Just as Kine says, what's important in this game isn't how we play.

65
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,300
What's important is that we win, no matter what tactics we use.

66
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,500


67
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,150
Bow !

68
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,700
Pleased to play with you !

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Team

70
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Meiwa Ichi

71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Senkawa

72
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,650
They let us take the field first, even though we're the visitor.


73
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,800
It's all great for us.

74
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,900
I thought I asked you 
not to hold back on us.

75
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:56,230
Well, it's way too cruel to play
the first-string from the start.

76
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,310
It would be a problem if you lose to us.

77
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,790
Oh, stop kidding. They aren't 
your usual second-string players.

78
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,260
They're second-string on Meiwa's team, 
which is famed for its deep roster.

79
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,000
They're all good enough to be
first-string players at other schools.

80
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,100
If they were to lose...

81
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,500
...I'd shave my head.

82
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,990
Hey, there's no way you'll be playing in this game.

83
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,680
Take it easy and 
watch from the dugout.

84
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,990
Senior, you might want to warm up, too.

85
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, well.

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,870
Give them a rude awakening, Hiro.

87
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,950
And drag Meiwa's regular lineup,
and me, out onto the field.

88
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,440
Oh !

89
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,700
Hey !

90
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,800
He's very aggressive
 from the first pitch.

91
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,800
Safe !

92
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,630
Don't worry. Don't worry.

93
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,300
See ?

94
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,100
If we were to lose,
I'd shave my head.

95
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,660
This is really a drag.

96
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Why do we have to 
play a team like this ?

97
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,650
It can't be helped.

98
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,300
After all, Senkawa's principal is the
 boss of all the principals around here.

99
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,200
I wonder what that dude is thinking.

100
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,990
He told us not to hold back 
against these silly fan club guys.

101
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,300
Anyway, let's finish this off quickly and get back to real practice.

102
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,660
Yeah. If we score like twenty runs in three innings, they'll give up.

103
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,050
Damn right !

104
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,330
Runners on the 
corners with no outs.

105
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,610
Out !

106
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,060
Huh ?

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,700
Oh my.

108
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,300
I'm surprised that no runs were scored with runners on first and third with no outs.

109
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,490
Your guys are putting up a good fight.


110
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,400
As I said, it will be a 
problem if you lose to us.

111
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,500
Oh, please. 
It was just dumb luck.

112
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,640
What's going on ?
The second-string is playing ?

113
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,300
Yeah.

114
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,880
I thought I'd be able to see Hiro's silly max-effort pitch for the first time in a while.

115
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm a little disappointed.

116
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,640
You'll be able to see it.

117
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,690
Really ?

118
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,700
Meiwa Baseball Club is not that soft, including the second-string.

119
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Anyway, I'm going to be 
pulling for Hiro for this game.

120
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,200
Is that okay ?

121
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,000
It's just today, right ?

122
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
Of course.

123
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,890
Then it's okay.

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,990
Strike ! Batter out !

125
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,650
Man, he doesn't throw like any second or third-string player I've ever seen.

126
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,750


127
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,380
Geez, I have to pitch to a 
sick person ? I can't take this.

128
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,990
Yeah, he's good !

129
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,250
The fielder is good, too...

130
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
Safe !

131
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,400
Yeah !

132
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,350
A perfectly laid-down bunt
 just barely makes it...?

133
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,650
He runs really fast !

134
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:05,980
Um...

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,650
Who is he ?

136
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,730
Hey, Noda ?

137
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,900
He's hittable ! He's hittable !

138
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,200
Okay, okay.

139
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,450
His batting form looks
 good for a lousy hitter.

140
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,090
EYECATCH

141
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,240
Out !

142
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,610
Damn.

143
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,850
Impressive, third batter.

144
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,000
That was a great at-bat 
to advance the runner.

145
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,240
Shut up. More importantly, you should be careful.

146
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,780
That pitcher's fastball moves a bit.

147
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,650
Who are you talking to ?

148
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,900
Don't you know what 
I used to be called ?

149
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,980
Of course not.

150
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,000
"Dr. Baseball."

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,260
In terms of knowledge
and analysis, I'm a genius.

152
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,700
If I see three pitches...

153
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,800
...that's enough for me to figure out a pitcher's velocity, power, quirks, and everything.

154
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,830
Huh ? Noda, you're
 not the cleanup batter ?

155
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,100
I mean, he made so much noise...

156
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,200
...about how he wouldn't be able to get the bat on the ball if I didn't hit fourth.

157
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Strike !

158
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,660
Just watch, Kunimi.

159
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,660
I'll show you a model example of how to capture a pitcher based on baseball theories.

160
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,200
Sure thing, I'm watching you.

161
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,990
He sure talks tough.

162
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,650
Wait on the ball, swing from the waist without opening up the upper body...

163
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,380
...and...

164
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,450


165
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,190
Huh ?

166
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,390
Do you understand, Kunimi ?
 It's all about willpower !

167
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,930
That's the fundamental
of baseball mangas !

168
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,550
Hahaha !

169
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,580
And I'm someone who doesn't steal wallets, but steals second base instead.

170
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,760
Huh ?

171
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,550
Out.

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
I sure saw that.

173
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,450
Team

174
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,450
Meiwa Ichi

175
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,450
Senkawa

176
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,700
Hm ?

177
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,400
It'll be a problem if your team loses.

178
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,330
Oh, stop that.
The game is just beginning.

179
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,340
Nice job covering, shortstop.

180
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,950
That's right. 
The game is just beginning.

181
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,700
You're pitching like a slacker out there.

182
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,450
Huh ?

183
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,160
You should say that I'm pitching like a tactician.

184
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,800
I thought hard about what
 I should do in order to win.

185
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,000
More importantly, Hikari.

186
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,770
You're pulling for us today, right ?

187
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,200
Just for today, yeah.

188
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,640
What did Hideo say ?

189
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,000
"Just for today," he said.

190
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,490
He let us have the goddess of victory on our side.

191
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,250
Just for today.

192
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,450
Then we'll invite you to our dugout.

193
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,320
You can sit and watch comfortably.

194
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,950
Thanks for that.

195
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,450
Now, I'll get going.

196
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Foul !

197
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,410
Foul !

198
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,140
Out !

199
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,960
Oh, well. Can't you do anything about your slow-footedness ?

200
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,650
Try not to screw up.

201
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,220
B: Hmm...

202
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,650
We're getting the ball right on the barrel of the bat.

203
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,400
Why aren't we scoring any runs ?

204
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
Geez, this game feels like a set-up.

205
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, come on.

206
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
In a game like this, 
once we score one run...

207
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,740
...the next runs will come to us like a crumbling sand castle.

208
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
That's right.

209
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,700
We'll get more runs than 
we could ever want.

210
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,700
You guys should stay
 second-string forever.

211
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,650
Huh ?

212
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,900
Alright, you got it !

213
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:19,710
Out !

214
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,100
He almost got it !

215
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,510
It would've been an infield hit, if only 
our Yamaguchi were their third baseman !

216
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,200
Hey...

217
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,220
It's still just one out !

218
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,300
Arikawa, narrow down the target and chop it down from the top !

219
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,000
And don't swing at high pitches !

220
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Yeah !

221
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,000
Avoid popping up, no matter what !

222
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,700
Yeah !

223
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,650
Keep the swing compact !

224
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,650
That's the way !

225
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,650
Oh, that was close !

226
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,120
If you keep the swing a little more compact, you'll get it !

227
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,030
He hasn't changed in this regard.

228
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,120
Yeah.

229
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,550
You don't have to be a stranger. 

230
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,270
Okay then.

231
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,650
There's no need to go for a big hit !

232
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,450
Just slap it ! Slap !

233
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,550
It feels like the old days, doesn't it ?

234
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,610
It does.

235
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,030
Your elbow will break
 down in three months ?

236
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,700
You're not going to say that you're quitting, are you ?

237
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,600
If you take baseball away from
you, there'll be nothing left.

238
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,970
If you're a man, you should follow
 the path you've chosen to the end.

239
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,850
Don't turn your back midway through your journey.

240
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,570
When you go down, you go head-first.

241
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,840
You should cure your elbow pain with your willpower.

242
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,450
Moron, it's just a sport.

243
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,960
Sports are things that are 
supposed to strengthen your body.

244
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,640
What kind of morons are out there
playing sports to ruin their bodies ?

245
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,650
After all, good health is the most 
important thing for human beings.

246
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,200
Yeah.

247
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,200
What kind of an old man are you ?

248
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,570
You're so gutless !

249
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,120
Say whatever you want.

250
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,670
Nowadays, self-destructive heroes aren't in vogue.

251
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,770
This is my retirement pitch.

252
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,560
You should watch it, since you've known me since the first time I played catch.

253
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,320
Here I go !

254
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,280
Go on.

255
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,400
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

256
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,530
Well, good work.

257
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,700
Ouch.

258
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,280
Why are you just standing there blankly ? You should catch it.

259
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,900
It's your retirement memorial ball.

260
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Moron. With these things, you have to
wait and feel the afterglow, you know ?

261
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,220
Ouch...

262
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,500
You shouldn't cry.

263
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,990
You're so dramatic.

264
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,050
It really hurt !

265
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,090
Oh, you mean your elbow, not your head ?

266
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,830
Moron...

267
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,970
Would you like a drink ?

268
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,090
...?

269
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,450
Barley tea.

270
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,550
Thanks.

271
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:41,830
Out !

272
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,900
That was close !

273
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,430
He would've been totally safe if only
that first baseman were our Hironaga !

274
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,070
Hey...

275
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,270
It's only the third inning ! 
Let's go for it !

276
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,990
Of course ! Let's go for it !

277
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,880
Yeah !

Notes:
Meiwa Principal saying he'd shave his head: "Shaving head" is a gesture of becoming a monk, i.e. abandoning the worldly ambitions and going into the path of religion.

286
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:32,670
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

 sound further and further away.

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,120
The star I'm watching today...

295
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,600
...glistened yesterday.

296
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,220
In the town full of things that disappear...

297
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,350
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

298
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:06,330
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

299
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:14,450
...rather than losing our time to regret.

300
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,850
Happiness is not something...

301
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,680
...that someone does for me.

302
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:31,250
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

303
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,800
Hiro, you won't be able to get through this lineup with your dodgy pitching now.

304
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,980
Damn. I wish I could get through the lineup one more time with this stuff.

305
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,460
Hide-chan is going to get
 two plate appearances.

306
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,250
You came here to pull for me, right ?

307
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,200
Of course.
 Just for today, though.

308
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,140
Then cheer for me with
everything you've got !

309
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,850
You should pitch with 
everything you've got, too !

310
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,910
Okay.

311
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,180
Next episode of H2 is,
 "I Look Kind of Cool, Right ?"

312
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,610
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

313
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,450
Next episode of H2 is

314
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,450
I Look Kind of Cool, Right ?

315
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,450
Look forward to it !
