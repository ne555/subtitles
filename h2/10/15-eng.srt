00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,440
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,550

Team

Meiwa Ichi

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,100
Senkawa

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,150
All right ! Let's crush 
them in one blow !

21
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,270
Let's destroy the sand castle now !

22
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,900
We should cheer, too !

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,910
Well, that was the
eighth hit given up already.

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,800
What're you talking about ?!
 We're winning right now !

25
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,980
But I mean, it feels like
we're just getting lucky.

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,190
When the runners are in scoring position, the batted ball goes right at the fielder for some reason.

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,550
For some reason, when runners are in scoring position, the ball goes right to the fielders.

28
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,300
How faint-hearted ! This is how good we actually are !

29
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,630
You should have faith
in your ace pitcher !

30
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,400
That's right. Two perfect games, five no-hitters.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,350
If we include unofficial practice games, we don't even know how many records he has.

32
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,630
But that was when he 
was in junior high, right ?

33
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,990
That's true.

34
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,650
We should cheer ! Okay ?!

35
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,550
Okay...

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Give me the scorebook.

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,000
Damn ! That guy again ?

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,200
When we have scoring opportunities, the balls go right at the fielders.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,390
Most of our outs are being made by their 
second baseman and center fielder.

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,360
All right ! Go ! Go !

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Out ! Change !

42
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,990
I feel like I've seen
that pitcher somewhere.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,930
Hey, good job !

44
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,050
Shut up !

45
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,200
How much longer are you
going to pitch like a slacker ?

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,180
I joined you to beat
 Tachibana, you know ?

47
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,420
Settle down.

48
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,650
Even if they're second-string...

49
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,990
...if they lose to an ordinary fan club, both Meiwa and Hideo will lose face.

50
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,200
Shut up !

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,780
I pitch better than 
you're pitching right now !

52
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,000
Listen ! You should drag
him into the game already !

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,550
Otherwise, I'm going to...

54
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,210
Great job, Kine !

55
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,200
Nice throw back to home plate !

56
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,360
I'm going to work hard, Koga.

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,550
"Otherwise, I'm going to..." what ?

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,250
Meiwa sure is impressive. They have a deep roster.

59
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,830
Yeah. In spite of it all,
 they're hitting the ball well.

60
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,200
The way it's going, you won't be able to deceive them for much longer.

61
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,800
Well, let's take it as far as we can.

62
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,300
It's a pretty good team.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It'll be a problem if you lose, Mr. Meiwa.

64
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,070
Oh ?

65
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,810
Nice batting !

66
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,160
Nice batting !
Let's push them here !

67
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,190
Huh ? What is it ?

68
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,600
Nothing.

69
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,500
This is just a show of courtesy.

70
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,920
I got it !

71
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,290
Strike ! Batter out !

72
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,110
Oh ?

73
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,240
You've been spared this time.

74
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,650
The opponent's pitcher is a finesse guy who pitches to the corners.

75
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,360
If we look for the right pitch and hit for contact, we can get him.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,340
Let's finish him off this inning !

77
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,060
Yeah !

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,180
You don't have to get so worked up...

79
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,470
Well, let's see how far I can go.

80
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh ?

81
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,450
Pitch inside.

82
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,130
Throw a curveball that drops from a 
hittable spot, and it'll be a fly ball to center.

83
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,690
I got it ! I got it !

84
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:22,850
Oh...

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,100
Nice job covering !

86
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,530
Shut up ! Pitch seriously !

87
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,720
I am.

88
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,130
Nice job, second baseman.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,640
Now then...

90
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,320
He wanted an out on a fly ball to center,
but it was single to right-center field.

91
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,320
...but it was single
to right-center field.

92
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,000
He wanted a double-play on a grounder to second, but it was nearly a single to center.

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,000
...but it almost turned into a single to center field.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,300
Now, is he going to go for a double-play with the second baseman again ?

95
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,740
Out !

96
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,940
Dammit !

97
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,190
Phew ! That was close.

98
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,900
It looks like they're
 finally getting serious.

99
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,650
After all, it was unreasonable to
 think that I could deceive them...

100
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,450
...by spotting the pitches with ordinary fastballs.

101
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,000
Top of fifth, runners on
second and third with two outs.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,310
If we make a mistake here, it'll hurt.

103
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,120
I agree.

104
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,470
Are you going to be okay ?

105
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,230
Hm ?

106
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,970
I mean, we're totally relying on you.

107
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,060
That puts a lot of 
pressure on you, doesn't it ?

108
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,700
We started this game without too much hope anyway.

109
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,030
Let's take it easy.

110
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,630
We've come this far. You've done plenty good already.

111
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,990
Don't you want to win ?

112
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,250
Eh ?!

113
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,810
You want to win, right ?

114
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, but...

115
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,700
Then let's win !

116
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,700
Hang in there, Kunimi !

117
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,690


118
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,710
Strike !

119
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,800
Strike two !

120
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,750


121
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,160
Strike ! Batter out !

122
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Yay ! I struck out a 
batter for the first time !

123
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,700
Hooray !

124
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,600
I struck out a Meiwa hitter !

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm so happy !

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,300
It's embarrassing. Stop it.

127
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,370
It's too late now.

128
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,760
What's with that pitcher ?

129
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
I don't know.

130
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,650
I don't have any interest, 
so I have no idea what his name is.

131
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,900
Really ?

132
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,000
It'll be a problem if you lose to us.

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,550
Oh, please. 
Who do you think we are ?

134
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,310
We are the prestigious Meiwa team. 
There's no way we're going to lose.

135
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,020
I hope that's the case.

136
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,150
What is our principal doing ?

137
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,130
Who knows ?

138
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,940
Regulars

139
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,940
need

140
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,940
to

141
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,940
play.

142
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,610
That was impressive !

143
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,420
This is the first time I've 
seen a pitch as fast as that !

144
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,660
You're exaggerating.

145
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,680
I mean, really. 
We can win this thing.

146
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,300
We can do it. 
We definitely can.

147
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm getting fired up !

148
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,680
The opponent's dugout has a serious look now.

149
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,530
They must have put in some 
colored contact lens or something.

150
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,200
Colored contact lens, huh ?

151
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,510
What ? That pitch was
right down the pipe.

152
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,370
Three outs ! Change !

153
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,650
They're getting the timing right.

154
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,060
Our seniors are actually doing great.

155
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,990
Yeah. We have to make sure this club becomes an official one.

156
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,640
Where's my glove...?

157
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,620
Is this it ?

158
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,050
Yeah, that's it. Thanks.

159
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,880
Was that a new fan of mine ? 
She's pretty good-looking.

160
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,290
But I feel like I've seen
 her somewhere before.

161
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,710
All right, I'm on a roll now ! 
Let's go after them !

162
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,500
The keys to their defense are the 
second baseman and the center fielder.

163
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,750
And the pitcher has a great command of his pitches and an unexpectedly live fastball.

164
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,550
That's fine. 
That's all they have.

165
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,900
There's no way a nameless
 first year pitcher can keep going...

166
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,200
...because high school baseball, no, Meiwa baseball is too tough.

167
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,310
Kunimi !

168
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,590
Hang in there !

169
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,510
Leave it to me !

170
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,190
Ouch...

171
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,040
Hey, be serious, Hiro !

172
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,700
Okay.

173
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,760
Hiro...?

174
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,850
Kunimi...Hiro...?

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,580
T...timeout !

176
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,160
EYECATCH

177
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,700
Meiwa's starters are in now.

178
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,220
Ah, we might be done for.

179
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,120
I thought we might win...

180
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,300
Hey, famous guy.

181
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,110
I was hoping that they might wait for another inning. 

182
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,600
We've got four innings left.

183
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Unless you pitch a no-hitter, you'll face Hideo twice.

184
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,930
That puts some pressure on us.

185
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,410
Yeah.

186
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,090
But this is why we can't quit baseball.

187
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,050
Right ?




188
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,740
Play !

189
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,230
Strike !

190
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,720
I thought he injured his elbow and quit.

191
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,110
Lots of things happened.

192
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,120
Strike.

193
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,470
Strike ! Batter out !

194
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,660
All right. 
One out ! One out !

195
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,430
All right.

196
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,000
Wow ! The guy was 
definitely late with his swing.

197
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,500
We can pull this off ! 
We can do it !

198
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,380
This is how he should
 have thrown from the start.

199
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,610
It's fast.

200
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,450
I can tell from just watching.

201
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,820
Faster than it looks, I mean.

202
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,560
Strike !

203
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,440
I see.

204
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,160
In that case...

205
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,900
He couldn't deaden the ball.

206
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,100
But it flew into a good spot.

207
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,830
Out !

208
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,250
Nice job, second baseman.

209
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,660
Batter out !

210
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,350
Yeah !

211
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,540
Shall I be honest with you, Tachibana ?

212
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,530
When I saw Seinan Junior High play, I wanted him more than you.

213
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,360
More than you, who hits fourth as a first year on the prestigious Meiwa team.

214
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm not surprised at all.

215
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:04,900
You say you don't want us to lose, but in actuality, you came here to win, didn't you ?

216
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,400
If you make it an official club after defeating us...

217
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,940
...it would be great 
publicity for your new team.

218
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,430
I have no interest in gaining publicity through baseball.

219
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,380
Well, sorry. We gain publicity through our powerhouse high school baseball team.

220
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,160
I don't want them to be an official club.

221
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,670
You don't have to worry.

222
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,560
We are going to win. We're a 
prestigious baseball school, after all.


223
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm counting on you.

224
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,400
What is it ?

225
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Huh ?

226
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,830
I'm making a facial expression to 
show that I'm surprised once again.

227
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,030
When I'm playing baseball, I look kind of cool, right ?

228
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,250
Yeah.

229
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,220
You sure seem fired up.

230
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah.

231
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,760
Our opponent is worth it, after all.

232
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,000
She's cute.

233
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,390
Hey, who's that girl ?

234
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,190
Oh, you don't know her.
She's Hideo's girlfriend.

235
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,620
What ? Why is Tachibana's
 girl in our dugout ?

236
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,470
It's fine. 
She's supporting us for today.

237
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,270
Huh ? What's going on ?

238
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,600
She's Hiro's childhood friend.

239
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
We've known her 
longer than Hideo has.

240
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,400
Oh.

241
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,900
What's this ? 
You're so pathetic.

242
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,700
You let Tachibana take this beauty away 
from you, even though he had a later start ?

243
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,920
What a moron.

244
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,920
You're annoying. Just go away.

245
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,610
Ah, how pathetic !

246
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,490
Hey, have you ever found a "hit" ?

247
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,850
In my case, there were
no more tickets left.

248
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,510
I'll show you my junior high 
photo sometime. You'll laugh.

249
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,510
It's funny.

250
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,700
Until the second year of junior high, I was a snot-nosed midget.

251
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,540
Finally, my height caught up, and I started to think about maybe looking for a girlfriend...

252
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,960
Strike ! Batter out !

253
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,350
Damn ! 
Three up and three strikeouts.

254
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,700
Their first stringers sure are good.

255
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,920
This is it.
 This is baseball.

256
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,980
Well, it's getting interesting.

257
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,750
Yeah.

258
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,150
Good luck.

259
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,700
Are you sure about that ?

260
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,340
The lead-off batter this inning is Hideo.

261
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,610
I'm cheering for Hiro, for today.

262
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,500
Finally, my height caught up, and I started to think about maybe looking for a girlfriend...

263
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
...but all the girls that interested me 
were in the midst of their first love.

264
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,150
Seriously ?

265
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,740
What's the point of lying about this sort of thing ?

266
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,960
Let's pull ourselves together here !

267
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,730
Three more innings, let's do it !

268
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,740
Let's go ! Let's go !

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,220
The star I'm watching today...

286
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,700
...glistened yesterday.

287
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,320
In the town full of things that disappear...

288
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,450
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

289
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:06,430
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

290
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,550
...rather than losing our time to regret.

291
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,950
Happiness is not something...

292
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,780
...that someone does for me.

293
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:31,350
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

294
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,940
We've all been waiting for it.
 Hide-chan and Hiro finally face off.

295
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,690
Well, if you can hit it, go right ahead !

296
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,910
Tachibana is a great guy.

297
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,120
Haruka ?

298
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,330
In my case, the guys who seemed nice all turned out to be superficial; they were total misses.

299
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,200
In my case, the guys who seemed nice turned out to be superficial; they were total misses.

300
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,110
Really ? But this time, you'll...

301
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,840
What are you two talking about ?

302
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,550
Next episode of H2 is,
 "This Time, It's Not a Miss."

305

Look forward to it !

306
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,370
Are you having a refreshing workout ?

307
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:06,940
