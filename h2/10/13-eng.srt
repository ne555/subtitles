Presented by Central Anime

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,440
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,760

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,650
 Episode 13

14
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,650
You'll Understand If You're My Friend

15
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Huh ?

16
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,400
What are you doing here ?

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,270
What do you mean ?
This is my room.

18
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,750
Meiwa doesn't have practice today ?

19
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,650
People were saying that there was no 
doubt that Meiwa would go to the Koushien...

20
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,180
...but it ended up losing
the final on a walkoff.

21
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,650
And we, the Fan Club, will become an official club if we defeat this prestigious Meiwa Daiichi...

22
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,770
...or be disbanded if we lose.

23
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,500
So you're going 
to go easy on us ?

24
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,450
Sorry, no.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,140
All the other guys
 are practicing as usual.

26
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,300
Then why ?

27
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,080
I have to go to the 
doctor now, so I left early.

28
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,940
Are you injured ?

29
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,060
Are you ill ?

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,730
I'm just going to the dentist.

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,610
I wouldn't want it to start hurting before an important game.

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,710
You should have four
or five teeth extracted !

33
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,950
Shut up.

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,840
Your dentist is lousy !

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, well.

36
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,650
All Meiwa baseball club 
members should get food poisoning.

37
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,100
I guess that won't happen.

38
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,550
Um, well...

39
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,000
...as long as no balls are hit to the outfield, we should be fine.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,700
The issue is how
to solidify the middle. 

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,260
Someone who runs well, has a 
strong arm, knows baseball well...

42
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:30,390
There is someone who is an overconfident, selfish, disagreeable show-off.

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,940
If only we could find Meiwa's weakness...

44
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,190
If I recall, he has two sets
of practice uniforms, right ?

45
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,520
Yeah.

46
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,800
There's a set here, too.

47
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,290
Meiwa's baseball club 
has 80 members. Right ?

48
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,800
Hide-chan.

49
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,070
Oh ? Your archery club's
practice starts now ?

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,390
Yeah.
You're going to the dentist ?

51
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,190
Yeah, in preparation for the game against Senkawa.

52
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,650
Loads of over 2 tons
prohibited 60 meters
from this point

53
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,040
You don't have any thoughts of losing the game against Senkawa for their sake ?

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,200
No. It's going to 
be a serious match.

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,290
You're stubborn.

56
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,770
Yeah, I'm stubborn.

57
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,380
Get set, go !

58
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,100
Let's see who's faster !
Whoever loses owes the other a drink !

59
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,560
All right !

60
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,400
Meiwa Daiichi High School

61
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,310
Good job.

62
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,860
Speak up !

63
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,450
Dammit.

64
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,480
Oh.

65
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,720
The legs are too long, but it's tight around the waist.

66
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,550
Hey, you there.

67
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,960
What year are you ?

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,810
Hey, Suzuki !

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,010
Help me out here !

70
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,360
Okay.

71
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,330
Don't act nervous.

72
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,430
It makes you seem more suspicious.

73
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,650
There are a lot people here.

74
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,500
If you wear a cap and act
 normal, no one will notice.

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,760
Yeah.

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,450
If only that idiot had shut them 
down in the bottom of the ninth...

77
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,750
...we wouldn't have had to go through this much trouble.

78
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,450
What are his pitches like ?

79
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,030
I can't really tell unless
I catch for them myself.

80
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,850
All right, one more !

81
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,390
Excuse me, Saitou.

82
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,160
I'm Tamura.

83
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

84
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,540
Thanks.

85
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,910
Tamura. Tamura.

86
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,650
Tamura from the baseball club. 
Tamura from the baseball club.

87
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,250
You have a phone call from home.

88
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,800
Please report to 
the office right away.

89
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,910
A call from home ?

90
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh, shall I fill in for you ?

91
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,660
Yeah, thanks.

92
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,340
When Tamura takes the phone, you're in charge, nyakay ?

93
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,150
Um, excuse me.

94
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,190
Tachibana went to the dentist today.

95
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,740
Today's loser is tomorrow's winner.

96
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,580
Just kidding.
One sitting mat.

97
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,470
Hm ?

98
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,770
How could they lose with this pitcher...?

99
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,680
Hey, are you a first year ?

100
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,930
Um, well, yes.

101
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,140
What's your name ?

102
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,220
Um, I'm Suzuki.

103
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,550
You're easy to pitch to, with both your body shape and the way you set up.

104
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,840
You're promising, so work hard.

105
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,660
Thank you.

106
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,550
They're hitting squarely back to center field.

107
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,910
Hey, you there !

108
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,720
Don't just stand there ! Go out there and pick up the balls !

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,480
Yes, sir.

110
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,300
The starters' hits carry far.

111
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,470
This lineup plus Hideo, huh ?

112
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,850
No matter how you look at it, 
they're going to hit it to the outfield.

113
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,120
Right now, I'll settle for two dates with Koga, with a bonus kiss.

114
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,490
I mean, you definitely look cool 
when you're pitching on the mound !

115
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,830
Moron...!

116
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,250
Throw the ball back !

117
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,770
What...?

118
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,900
So what are your thoughts ?

119
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,350
If that lefty pitches, our fan club guys won't stand a chance.

120
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,720
They'll just have to put on a bunt attack, and hope that our opponent makes a mistake.

121
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,150
And us, too. If we look to hit a
 big one, we'll fall into their trap.

122
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,310
I see.

123
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,710
How are their hitters ?

124
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,380
They're better than I thought.

125
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,520
If they had gone to the Koushien, the newspapers would have rated them as "A."

126
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,200
Any strategies ?

127
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,400
Trust the fielders and go
full-strength after the hitters.

128
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,020
In that case, we'll need Kine.

129
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,550
Right now, I'll settle for a kiss...

130
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,960
We can't agree to
 his conditions, though.

131
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,250
More importantly, there's Yanagi.

132
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,190
If we don't have him at
second base, it's all over.

133
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,890
I see.

134
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,450
Well, that was productive.

135
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,030
It's great that we took the
trouble to go spy on them.

136
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,970
We still have one week, after all.

137
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,380
That's right !

138
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,410
Yeah, it was so useful !

139
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,400
It was.

140
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,930
Sorry !

141
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,150
It reminds you of our days with
the Hakusan Angels, doesn't it ?

142
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,910
Right, Fune ?

143
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,200
Namihei...

144
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,780
EYECATCH

145
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,030
Strike !

146
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:41,480
I hear that you told the coach that you'd quit the Hakusan Angels if I was the cleanup hitter.

147
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,800
That coach had no eye for talent.

148
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,000
Before you came along, they used to win with scores like 3-2, 3-1...

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,900
...but with you, the team 
became capable of scoring 5 runs.

150
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,520
But in exchange, you couldn't be sure
how many runs the team would give up.

151
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,680
Back then, you weren't
what the team needed.



152
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,880
It was me.

153
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,240
It really was me !

154
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,760
It's not that the coach didn't have an eye for talent.

155
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,100
What ?


156
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,670
I'm the one who kicked you out.

157
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,140
By making you out to 
be a suspicious person.

158
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,960
Strike !

159
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,430
Fortunately, no one on the team spoke up on your behalf, so it was easy.

160
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,450
What are you talking about ?

161
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,650
Well, all I did was put the
 coach's wallet in your bag...

162
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,740
...in a way that it would
be easily noticeable.

163
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,840
Twice.

164
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,560
Strike ! Batter out !

165
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,850
Well, that's in the past. 
Don't worry about it.

166
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,250
Thanks to being the cleanup 
batter for the Hakusan Angels...

167
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,610
...my baseball career got on an elite
 track, from junior high to high school.

168
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,430
Of course, it was a track that I could run because of how good I am.

169
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,450
My one miscalculation was
that Hiro resumed baseball.

170
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,400
I was glad when he went to a high school without a baseball club.

171
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,200
Can it be that the lousy doctor who misdiagnosed Kunimi's elbow is...?

172
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,380
Of course I introduced
him to that doctor.

173
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:50,740
Oh well, he's in a fan club that will be disbanded next week without a doubt.

174
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,600
Weren't you friends ?

175
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,960
We are friends.

176
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,520
When we're not playing baseball, that is.

177
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,410
All stones on my rail will be 
kicked out to the soccer club.

178
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,700
I don't care if baseball loses popularity or if it hurts the caliber of play.

179
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,950
As long as my contract money
increases, that's all that matters.

180
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,180
You were smart to give up on baseball so quickly.

181
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,980
I think we can be friends.

182
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,590


183
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,510
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,940
Excuse me, can you give us the ball ?

185
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,230
That bastard !



186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
I'm not going to let
you get your way !

187
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,000
Is he simple, or just honest ?

188
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,000
Thanks.

189
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,200
He's joining the 
Baseball Fan Club ?

190
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,720
With no conditions attached ?

191
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,410
Maybe he ate something bad ?

192
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,990
No ! Our earnest feelings must have reached God !

193
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,230
God, huh ?

194
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,880
Hey, Kunimi !

195
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,200
We've got to win
the upcoming game !

196
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
We're not going to let 
Tachibana get his way !

197
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,300
By Tachibana, you mean the first year who hits cleanup for the prestigious Meiwa...

198
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,100
...and who is from the food and 
liquor store, Tachibana Store.

199
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,670
That's the Tachibana Hideo
I'm talking about !

200
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,230
What do you think he said ?

201
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,800
You and I are all rails on a rock !

202
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,400
You mean, rocks on a rail ?

203
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,450
Um, yeah, that's it !

204
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,900
All the geniuses like me that are going to get in his way...

205
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:42,300
...he said he'd crush, kick around, clobber, and throw them to the nether reaches !

206
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,210
Hideo said that ?

207
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,380
He says he and you are friends as long as you don't play baseball !

208
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,500
He says he's going to kick
you over to the soccer club !

209
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,900
Fight, oh, fight, oh, fight, oh, fight, oh...

210
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,290
All he cares about is himself. He doesn't care about you.

211
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,310
He introduced you to a quack ! 
And he turned me into a wallet thief !

212
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,830
It was all for his own sake !

213
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,550
That guy is a demon !

214
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,310
A devil !

215
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,900
Hideo, you bastard !

216
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,750
Who's a rock on a rail ?!

217
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,160
We're friends as long as
I'm not playing baseball ?

218
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,490
You're going to kick me 
back to the soccer club ?

219
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,650
How dare you say that !

220
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,240
Is he simple, or just honest ?

221
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,300
You mean stupid.

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,780
He hid the coach's wallet and blamed it on someone else ?

223
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,450
You're stupid.

224
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,100
Are you actually his friend ?

225
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,210
You don't even know if Hide-chan is the kind of person who'd do that ?

226
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,150
I don't know what he
was like in grade school.

227
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,000
He introduced you to a quack so that you'd quit baseball ?

228
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,850
Moron.

229
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,000
It's cold.

230
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,250
When Noda hurt his
back for the first time...

231
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,800
...who took him to Uetake's clinic,
saying that he put his full trust in him ?

232
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,590
It was this guy.

233
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,300
Huh ?

234
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,100
Moron.

235
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,010
Don't keep calling me moron.

236
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,710
I knew something was a little weird.

237
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,910
A little weird ? 
It was all weird.

238
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,690
You should have realized right away.

239
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,000
You should know why Hide-chan 
would act like a bad guy.

240
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,600
If you're his friend, that is.

241
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Realized !

242
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,060
So is Kine playing in the game ?

243
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,060
Yeah, he's really into it, 
saying that he won't forgive you.

244
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,180
Thanks for that. I'll be sure to resolve the misunderstanding after the game.

245
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,700
That's okay.

246
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:07,000
Regardless of the reason, it doesn't change the fact that he quit baseball because of me.

247
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,900
Defeat Meiwa Ichi !

248
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,360
I'm happy if we can play 
to the best of our abilities.

249
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,330
If you're my friend,
you should hold back a little.

250
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,480
Because I'm your friend,
I'm not going to hold back.

251
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,960
Anyway, all that's left is Yanagi.

252
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah.

253
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,380
Yanagi ?

254
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,900
Yeah, don't you remember ?

255
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,550
The guy who played second 
base for Kita Junior High ?

256
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,750
That Yanagi is at your school ?

257
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,560
Yeah.

258
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,150
I hadn't heard that.

259
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,980
Of course not. I didn't tell you.

260
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,700
Right ?

261
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,450
Right.

262
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,350
Why would Yanagi go to Senkawa, of all places ?

263
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,300
His father is a bit of an issue.

264
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,600
And he is the principal of our school.

265
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,950
You know about the team that lost a no-hitter with the score of 0-30 at the Koushien...

266
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,730
...Sousei High School, right ?


267
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,050
He's a graduate of that school.

268
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:13,000
Ever since then, all he hears about is that game, so he's totally bummed.

269
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,100
He says he hates high school baseball, and won't let Yanagi play.



270
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,680
I didn't know that your school had not only Kine, but Yanagi, too.

271
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,910
Huh ?

272
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,650
Hide, having played the role of the
bad guy already, can you call Yanagi...

273
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,250
...and threaten him by saying you'll set 
off a bomb at his house or something...

274
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,900
...if he doesn't play in the game ?

275
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,500
What ?

276
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,960
Moron !

277
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,250
One out with runners on first and second. Now batting is the fifth hitter, Tanaka.



278
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,060
It's a chance to drive in runs.

279
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,380
Well, the Koushien has finally begun.

280
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,550
Momiji Bank,
Branch Manager,
Oomori Yoshio

281
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,010
When the Koushien
starts, I feel all jittery.

282
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,080
Which high school did
you graduate from ?

283
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,990
Sousei.

284
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,260
Sousei !

285
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,460
Sousei High School.

286
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,470
Oh, that 0-30...

287
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,990
0-30 what ?

288
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,780
Um, well, nothing.

289
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:26,410
Now, about that certificate
of deposit that has matured.

290
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,490
I'm withdrawing it.

291
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,750
Huh ?

292
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,890
I'm withdrawing it, of course.

293
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,010
There !

294
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,390
Yes ! I've got
the go-ahead run !

295
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,590
Damn !

296
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,320
We should have gone with the disappearing pitch.

297
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,610
What's wrong, Hiro ? 
You've been cornered.

298
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:56,260
God must be hasty. He didn't have to arrange their showdown this soon.

299
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,330
Oh well, I guess it's over.

300
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,700
What ? It's not over yet !

301
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,030
There's still the bottom of the ninth !

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:29,820
Notes:
Hiro solidifying the middle: He's talking about the fielding positions of catcher,  second base, short-stop, through 
center field.

Another homophone joke: Dentist, "haisha," has the same sound as loser, "haisha." In stand-up comedy, one would throw a sitting mat for jokes that are either funny or not funny - I forget which.

310
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,720

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,170
The star I'm watching today...

319
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,650
...glistened yesterday.

320
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,270
In the town full of things that disappear...

321
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,400
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

322
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,380
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

323
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:14,500
...rather than losing our time to regret.

324
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,900
Happiness is not something...

325
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,730
...that someone does for me.

326
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:31,300
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

327
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,460
Finally, the day of destiny. 
The game is starting, right, Hiro ?

328
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,720
But, oh well,
they're underestimating us.

329
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,800
What is it ? You're playing
against their second-string team ?

330
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,840
It gives us a better 
chance of winning, though.

331
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,680
That's not good. Just give them a
rude awakening with your pitching.

332
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,760
You want me to drag their
first-string into the game ?

333
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,100
Fans across the nation are waiting
for your showdown with Hide-chan.

334
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,630
Next episode of H2 is,
