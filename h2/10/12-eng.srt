2
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,300
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,420
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:47,150
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,160
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,100
The game starts now.

7
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,170
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

8
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,240
It makes my heart bound.

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,740
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

10
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

11
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,300
 Episode 12

12
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,300
Maybe I Don't Have Much Luck With The Lottery

13
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,050
Let's go...

14
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,050
Let's go...

15
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,510
I'm not done yet...

16
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's do it, let's do it...

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,510
Fight ! Fight !

18
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,030
Guys, give it all you've got !

19
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,510
Fight ! Fight !

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,340
How is it ?

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,780
The effective temperature seems to be about 43 degrees(110F).

22
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,580
We first have to battle this heat before we play against Meiwa, I suppose.

23
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,050
I'm going to change my undershirt.

24
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,160
Um, I'll go buy some sports drinks.

25
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,220
At this rate, you'll all be dehydrated.

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,250
True.


27
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,440
I'll get going !

28
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,060
She's full of energy.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,490
Here we go !

30
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,120
You're working hard in this heat.

31
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,460
Don't say things that are obvious.

32
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,900
Just think about the
predicament we're in.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,900
The game against our school 
is next week, after all.

34
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,860
What brought you here, anyway ?

35
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,900
Your practice will be over soon, right ?

36
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,120
We still have one full 
hour before 2 o'clock.

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,700
Water, water...

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,930
Oh, the water is out.

39
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,870
What ?

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm going to the city pool.

41
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,510
Why don't we go swimming
 when you're done with practice ?

42
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,840
Swimming pool ? 
You should go with Hideo.

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,240
Swimming pool ?

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,510
Of course Hide-chan is coming, too.

45
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,500
Noda, come with us, too.

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,150
He's not coming.

47
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,370
There are lots of girls 
with high-cut swimsuits.

48
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,300
High-cut...

49
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,250
Girls...

50
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,650
You changed your mind, right ?

51
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,300
I said no.

52
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,170
See you.

53
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,180
Hey.

54
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,600
It's no good.

55
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,670
What's no good ?

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,630
If we go to the pool now, we can see that girl in her swimsuit ?

57
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,000
Will she be wearing a 
high-cut swimsuit, too ?

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,920
Everyone's thinking about Hikari's swimsuit now.

59
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,310
Well, this practice is useless, anyway.

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,920
But...

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,300
Hm ?

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,500
They're going to the swimming pool together. Why would she invite intruders ?

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Honestly.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,200
Come to think of it, you were 
often invited to join their dates.

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Hideo wasn't comfortable around girls.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Despite the fact that he asked me to introduce him to her...

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
...he didn't even speak a word when I first set those two up.

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,990
He'd only whisper in a quiet voice.

69
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,450
If I weren't there as an interpreter, they wouldn't have been able to communicate.

70
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,000
It took almost a year for them to speak with each other by themselves, I think.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,250
That's how advanced 
he was at that age.

72
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,500
On the other hand...

73
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,590
...we entered junior high while we were still kids, so we didn't think about boy-girl stuff.



74
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,970
In particular, I grew up slowly.

75
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,890
You were so small.

76
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,560
You definitely looked like
an elementary school kid.

77
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,600
Leave me alone.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,880
Bear with it. After all, you did become popular with girls in junior high.

79
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,000
On the Valentine's Day before graduation, you received more chocolates than Hideo.

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,360
It really went slowly.

81
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,060
Are Hiro and the others coming ?

82
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,060
He didn't say. But there's no use practicing in this heat.



83
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,670
Right about now, he's probably griping as he heads home to get his swimsuit.

84
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,110
Really ?

85
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,860
To the swimming pool !

86
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,600
But really, we finished junior high. 
Things shouldn't stay the way they were.

87
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, it's all right. She probably asked us out so that we could take a break.

88
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,450
I'm going to show you the splendid butterfly style of a former swimming club member.

89
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,300
Did you know ?




90
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,300
The "butterfly style" takes its name from a butterfly, Mr. Mothra.

91
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,910
Who're you calling Mothra ?

92
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,640
So I'll see you at the
 city swimming pool.

93
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,210
Okay.

94
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,900
Oh, no.

95
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,100
It's taking her too long.

96
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,730
We're leaving second
base open for you.

97
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,920
Big Brother Yanagi !

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
Oh, hello.

99
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,930
Great timing.

100
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,650
Can you coach 
these kids for a bit ?

101
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,300
There'll be an inter-town match
 the day after tomorrow.

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,200
In any case, catching the ball in front of you is fundamental.

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,250
Use the resilience of your
 knees, and stay low.

104
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,900
Until you actually catch the ball, don't worry about the runner or think about the throw.

105
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,550
It's easiest to catch when the
 ball is about to hit the ground.

106
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,190
The next easiest is when 
the ball is on a short hop.

107
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,200
And then when the ball
is at the top of a hop.

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Other than those, the ball often changes course, so be alert.

109
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, sorry.

110
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,810
Wow. You're as good as always.

111
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,420
You really are a 
fine second baseman.

112
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,080
We're keeping second 
base open for you.

113
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,550
Noda !

114
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,000
Where's Hiro ?

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,300
He's coming later !

116
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,600
She's late.
 I wonder what she's doing.

117
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,020
I doubt that's what it is, but...

118
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,760
...I guess...

119
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,800
...it's possible.

120
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,000
Kunimi !

121
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,340
This way !

122
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,510
Koga, practice is over.

123
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,320
Oh, I messed up again ?

124
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,790
Let's go back to the school.

125
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Wait, Haruka. Why don't
 you introduce me to him ?

127
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,350
Who is he ?

128
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,700
Nice to meet you. 
I'm Haruka's ex-boyfriend.

129
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,510
That's a strange name.

130
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,490
Who's my ex-boyfriend ? Don't say weird things !

131
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,130
When she was in the first year of junior high, I received a love letter from her.

132
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,900
So we went out for a while.

133
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,950
It wasn't a love letter !

134
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,400
She's a jealous girl, you know.

135
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,700
If I even had a brief chat with another girl, she'd get angry, and it would become trouble.

136
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,600
What's your point ?

137
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,130
Oh, don't worry. We didn't have a really deep relationship.

138
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,680
Not that deep.

139
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,400
You're not popular, are you ?

140
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,980
I'm not popular with girls ?



141
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,450
Haruka, you should tell him how many love letters I received in junior high.

142
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,300
With guys, I mean.

143
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,850
I asked if you were
not popular with guys.

144
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,800
What's the point of being
popular with such things ?

145
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,210
Just as I thought.

146
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,100
Kunimi, let's go.

147
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,230
Are you really fine with that, Haruka ?

148
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,470
You'll regret it. It's rare for 
me to ask out a girl myself.

149
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Next time you ask her out, you should get my permission first.

150
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,700
Are you sure you want
to talk to me like that ?

151
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,090
I know a lot of bad boys around here.

152
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey, if isn't Hiro !

153
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,240
Long time no see. 
I heard about it.

154
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Your elbow wasn't 
broken after all, huh ?

155
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,600
I'm happy for you.

156
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Thanks.

157
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,550
Are you in trouble or something ?

158
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,470
Not really. I bought too 
many drinks, so I'm in a bind.

159
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,050
And this guy says he doesn't want one.

160
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,250
Can you drink some ?

161
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,100
Oh, thanks.

162
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,600
If you're in any trouble,
just let us know.

163
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll lend you a hand any time.

164
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,120
See ya.

165
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,880
Get out of the way !

166
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,500
Your girl is waiting for you. You should go to her...

167
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Have a nice trip !

168
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm not going anywhere.

169
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,230
If you like, would you like to
go eat some curry and rice ?

170
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,600
Sure.

171
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,500
I know a great curry restaurant.

172
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
But before that...

173
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,060
If you have other 
things to do, it's fine.

174
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,550
Well, we have to go
 back before that.

175
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,840
We left our bags there.

176
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,470
Oh, that's right. You're right.

177
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,900
You're not going to
swim anymore, Hikari ?

178
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,670
It's getting cold.

179
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,700
In the end, he didn't come.

180
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,440
I guess things have
changed since junior high.

181
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,020
I was sure it was
somewhere around here.

182
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,200
Is there actually a restaurant
in a residential area like this ?

183
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,800
Good restaurants are often
 found in unexpected places.

184
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,670
Oh, I know ! 
It's in this alley !

185
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,720
I don't mind if we
go some other time.

186
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,110
No. Definitely no.

187
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,300
Huh ?

188
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,300
You don't have to be so stubborn.

189
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,000
No, I really want you to eat it.

190
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,700
Right, it must be past the station !

191
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,700
Honestly, you really saved me.

192
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,110
That person won't take me seriously, no matter how many times I say no.

193
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,400
He's unbelievably conceited.

194
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,350
 Shop Conceited

195
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,350
Original 
Triumphant 
Face

196
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,430
And who sent a love
letter to a guy like that ?

197
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,890
As I said, it wasn't 
anything like a love letter.

198
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
It was just...

199
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,400
It was just...?

200
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,110
More like I wrote something saying that I wanted to be a friend of his.

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,310
That's kind of how it
is at that age, right ?

202
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,370
How so ?

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,250
In the first year of junior high, girls just create idealistic fantasies from how someone looks...

204
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,000
...and falls in love with love,
rather than with the boy himself.

205
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,410
Oh, is that how it is ?

206
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,450
Tachibana is cool.

207
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,640
Tachibana is a good guy.

208
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Maybe I don't have much
luck with the lottery.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,650
All the guys I thought could be
nice have mostly been misses...

210
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,530
...when I look back and 
with a calmer mind.

211
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,290
You should change this
 careless aspect of yours first.

212
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,490
You draw a "miss" because you hastily grab one.

213
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,740
Hey, have you ever found a "hit" ?

215
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,900
In my case, there were
no more tickets left.

216
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,350
What ?

217
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll show you my junior high 
photo sometime. You'll laugh.

218
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,920
Until the second year of junior high, I was a snot-nosed midget.

219
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,760
Finally, my height caught up, and I started to think about maybe looking for a girlfriend...

220
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,810
...but by then, girls that interested me were all in the midst of their first love.

221
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,730
Seriously ?

222
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,690
What's the point of lying about this sort of thing ?

223
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,340
See you.

224
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,640
Yeah.

225
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,310
Well, do you want to get
some tea or something ?

226
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,950
It's okay.

227
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,940
I want to take a 
bath now, anyway.

228
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,610
I see.

229
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,450
Bye.

230
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,290
Bye, Hikari.

231
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,200
Huh ?

232
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,990
On a second thought,
let's have some tea.

233
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,500
Huh ?

234
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,300
Okay ?

235
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,080
But you're popular with girls now.

236
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,760
Huh ?

237
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,190
I mean, you're definitely cool, 
when you're pitching on the mound.

238
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,540
I don't know if I should be happy to hear it from someone who tends to draw a miss.

239
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm serious.

240
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,060
Oh well, you're capricious.

241
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,600
Now, never mind that.

242
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,290
Hm ?

243
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,720
What would you like to order ?
It's on me today.

244
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,800
Oh, lucky me.

245
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,200
So what would you like, Hide-chan ?

246
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,800
I'm convinced.
It's definitely this alley.

247
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,990
I've heard you say that so many times. My hunger is at its limit now.

248
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,960
I found it ! 
Look, this is the place !

249
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,830
Phew.

250
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,340
This one is a "hit."

251
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,180
Bottom of the ninth, a bases 
loaded homerun for a walkoff win !

252
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,000
Right !

253
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,820
Hey, Kunimi !

254
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,490
Look ! They gave me this !

255
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,530
She's having fun...

256
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,030
Oh, it's going out.

257
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,110
It's gone...

258
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,290
It was pretty.

259
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,130
Yeah.

260
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,250
I hope we'll get our second baseman.

261
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,050
Yeah.

262
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,920
What happened to your face ?

263
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,250
Oh, I ran into a telephone pole.

264
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,110
I see.

265
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,240
Dad, I...

266
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,400
It was a good bath.

267
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,100
I can go from here.

268
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,690
Okay.

269
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,320
Before you draw a "hit,"
don't get hit by a car.

270
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,040
Okay.

271
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,960
I'll see you tomorrow, at the field.

272
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,450
Good night !
 Thanks for today !

273
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,360
The fireworks were beautiful, Kunimi.

274
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,100
What happened to you yesterday ?
We were waiting for you.

275
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,000
It's my life.
I didn't say I'd come.

276
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh, okay.

277
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,320
I was going to show you the 
swimsuit figure of the grown-up Hikari.

278
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,950
How are you grown up ?

279
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,340
The swimsuit itself is different from what I had in junior high.

280
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,390
It's a high-cut lewd
kind of swimsuit.

281
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,890
You're lying.

282
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,440
Even if you say so, you 
actually regret it, don't you ?

283
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,300
Yeah, right !

284
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,250
I don't even need to see it.

285
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:51,250
With my talent, I can totally see you naked in my imagination, even when you're dressed.

286
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,220
Really ? So what's the color of my underwear today ?

287
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,360
Pink with a polka dot pattern.

288
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
That's what you're wearing.

289
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,030
Stop talking rubbish.
Just go to your practice.

290
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,510
Okay.

291
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,990
Hiro.

292
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,990
I'll cheer for you for now, until your club becomes official.

293
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,850
Can you break Hideo's arm 
when you get a chance, then ?

294
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,100
You moron !
Give me the apple back !

295
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,880
It's in my stomach already.

296
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,850
Geez. He really is still a brat.

297
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,650
Don't take unnecessary risks and charge.

298
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,560
Make sure to keep
the ball in front of you.

299
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
You're going to throw, right ?

300
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,940
Is this okay ?

301
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,900
Yeah.

302
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,700
I mean, you're definitely cool, 
when you're pitching on the mound.

303
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,910
One more !

304
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,750
Yahoo !

305
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,670
There !

306
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,970
 How about it, Kunimi ?

307
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,840
Right now, I can settle for two
dates with Koga, including a kiss.

308
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,600
The price will definitely rise. If you're going to buy, now is the chance.

309
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,700
For inquiry, contact the soccer club.

310
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,490
Guys who approach 
you are all like that ?

311
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,000
Honestly.

312
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,550
Even though I graduated from junior high, 
my luck with the draw hasn't changed, huh ?

313
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,660
In any case, one more 
week until the fateful game.

Notes:
Hiro talking to the tree: A willow tree is called "Yanagi."

Conceited Joke: This is another one of those homophone puns. The word that was used for "a conceited person" is "unubore-ya," and "-ya" also means the same thing as "shop," e.g. "vegetable shop" = "yao-ya," 
"fish store" = "sakana-ya." Kunimi is imagining a store named "unubore-ya," where "triumphant face" and such are sold.

321
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:32,470
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

322
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:40,320

 sound further and further away.

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,920
The star I'm watching today...

328
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,400
...glistened yesterday.

329
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,020
In the town full of things that disappear...

330
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,150
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

331
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:06,130
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

332
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:14,250
...rather than losing our time to regret.

333
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,650
Happiness is not something...

334
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,480
...that someone does for me.

335
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:31,050
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

336
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,470
Even if you're pitching, our lineup will definitely hit it to the outfield.

337
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,610
I know. I've done my research.

338
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,120
See ? So you need a good centerfielder.

339
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,430
Really, he's the one.

340
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,420
Here, you need Hide-chan's help.

341
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,240
What's Hide going to do ?

342
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,980
That's a secret.

343
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,500
