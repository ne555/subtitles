2
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,300
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,420
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:47,150
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,160
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,100
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,170
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,240
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,740
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,310

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,600
 Episode 10

14
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,600
Things Are Not Turning Out Well...

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,000
Senkawa High School

16
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,380
Where's the manager ?

17
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,550
She went to greet him.

18
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,730
Greet ? Who ?

19
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,530
You know, what's his name, the chairman of the PTA.

20
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,100
Oh.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Do you really think he can persuade that principal ?


22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,930
Who knows ?

23
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, my.
You've become so beautiful.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,230
They say that girls grow up fast, but after not seeing you for a while, I really feel that way.

25
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,100
Oh, you're such a sweet talker.

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,000
It's not just talk.

27
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,360
What do you mean ?

28
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Let's see. I should probably divorce my wife and propose to you soon.

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,930
What ?

30
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,550
I'll leave it to you then.

31
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,750
Sure, you can count on me.

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,340
I'll definitely make it 
an official baseball club.

33
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,010
Oh, that face.
You're worried ?

34
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,170
You can tell ?

35
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,350
You can rest assured. 
I'm the PTA chairman after all.

36
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,790
All right.

37
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,710
How about this ?

38
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,750
Thank you for doing this.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,630
Sure.

40
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,400
Principal's Office

41
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,500
Until you say yes, I won't leave.

42
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,320
Then how about this ?

43
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,350
The Final is Set
Meiwa Ichi vs Shinkawa
Face-off tomorrow !!

44
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,060
What about Meiwa-Ichi and Shinkawa ?

45
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,650
Girls' Dressing Room

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,170
How about this ?

47
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,700
You could catch that one !

48
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,500
Yeah !

49
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,780
Sorry I'm late !

50
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,240
Does it look like it will go okay ?

51
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,910
Mr. Takemura said, "Leave it to me."

52
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,700
You said he was the president of a construction company.

53
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,000
What kind of person is he ?

54
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,050
Despite how he looks,
he can be scatter-brained.

55
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,010
And he gets carried away easily.

56
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,400
Principal's Office

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,460
He talks big, but later plays dumb.

58
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,930
Even then, no one dislikes him. 
He really has an advantageous character.

59
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,150
Maybe we should plan our next move...

60
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,500
The Final is Set
Meiwa Ichi vs Shinkawa

61
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,600
Hey, Haruka. Are you going to accept my proposal ?

62
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,110
Again...

63
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,370
So how did it go ?

64
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,300
Yeah, about turning the baseball fan club into an official club.

65
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,750
Of course he approved it.

66
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,440
Really ?

67
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,490
I told you to leave it to me, didn't I ?

68
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,430
Um...

69
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,600
What is it ?

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,350
How did that stubborn 
principal approve it so easily ?

71
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,690
No, it wasn't easy.

72
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,650
You mean...?

73
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,350
The principal set an
outrageous condition.

74
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,340
Condition ?

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,130
Yeah. The condition is...

76
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,650
...that you play a practice game against this year's champion.

77
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,790
If you win, the club can 
become an official one.

78
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,610
No way. That's absurd.

79
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't worry.

80
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,250
Of course, I said no.

81
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,210
"Stop this nonsense !" I said.

82
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,700


83
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,650
It goes without saying.

84
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,450
There's no way that a school
that's advancing to the Koushien...

85
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,600
...would have time to 
play a practice game.

86
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,050
You're right.

87
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,940
So if anything, you'll play against the runner-up.

88
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,130
...?

89
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,200
Huh ?

90
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,900
Now, which one of you is Kunimi ?

91
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm...

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,550
That's me.

93
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,750
Oh, it's you.

94
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,050
Haruka told me about you.

95
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,590
You throw amazing pitches, I hear.

96
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,370
Oh.

97
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,900
Once this becomes an
official baseball club...

98
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,030
...there's no doubt that it will go to the Koushien, right ?

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,320
No, it's more than that.

100
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,450
I hear that it isn't a pipe-dream for the
team to win the national championship.

101
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,900
You can easily beat the runner-up from the regional tournament...

102
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,100
...and leave that principal speechless.

103
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,920
Now, guys, good luck to you.

104
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,310


105
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,650
Oh, yes.

106
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,900
It's probably a needless worry...

107
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:33,170
...but if you lose, the fan club will be abolished, so don't go easy on the opponent.

108
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,900
Who's going to win the
national championship ?

109
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,310
What ?

110
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,870
I guess that dude isn't the only one who talks big and gets carried away easily.

111
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,100
Now, let's practice !

112
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,170
If we lose, we'll be disbanded.

113
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,540


114
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,440


115
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,370
Now, fight, fight !

116
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,660
The sky is blue !

117
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,430
Is that true ?

118
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,600
That's so funny !

119
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,590
Hey, guys ! 
I have some big news for you !

120
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,020
What is it, Captain ?

121
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,510
Listen and be shocked.

122
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,480
That baseball fan club will be upgraded to an official club.

123
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,010
What ?

124
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,200
On the condition that
they win a practice game...

125
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,410
...against the runner-up in tomorrow's game between Meiwa-Shinkawa.

126
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,550
What if they lose ?

127
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,650
They're abolished.

128
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,430
That principal must
really hate baseball.

129
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,690
If they win, they'll be an official club...

130
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,110
What are you thinking ?

131
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,490
The only decent players
they have are the battery.

132
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,170
There's no way they can win with 
such a porous defense behind them.

133
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,300
Oh, that's right. 
What am I worried about ?

134
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,890
It'll be abolished ! 

135
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,800
This is such a downer.

136
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,250
Why is Meiwa even in the discussion ?

137
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,230
Maybe he feels some kind of rivalry against them ?

138
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,600
Well, our opponent will
probably be Shinkawa.

139
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,730
You never know. But of course,
I want Hideo to go to the Koushien.

140
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,000
Are you worried ?

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,030
Of course I am.

142
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,310
Don't worry. 
Meiwa will definitely win.

143
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,010
That's not what I'm worried about.

144
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,310
Whether we can defeat the 
runner-up or not is the issue.

145
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,740
Oh, that's right.

146
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,350
Shinkawa couldn't have advanced to the finals just by pure luck.

147
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,450
Right.

148
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:16,800
EYECATCH

149
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,650
Hm.

150
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,000
When it comes to the
night before the final...

151
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,410
...even you feel nervous.

152
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,400
Not really.

153
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
If the opposing pitcher were Hiro...

154
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,880
...I might be, though.

155
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,410
You're coming tomorrow, right ?

156
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,800
Actually...

157
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,210
I can't come.

158
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,080
The archery club has a
preliminary tournament next week.

159
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,590
You have practice, then ?

160
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,330
Our coach is really fired up.

161
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh.

162
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,830
To make up for it, I'll definitely
come see you at the Koushien.

163
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,720
What's wrong ?

164
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,620
No, it's nothing.

165
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,100
The Final Match !! Meiwa Ichi High School x Shinkawa High School

166
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,220
Out.

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,200
"The national championship is no pipe-dream once we're an official club," huh ?

168
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,200
As I was describing you to them, I just got carried away...

169
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,300
Are you mad at me ?

170
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,140
No, it's actually funny.

171
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,200
If you were talking about someone else, that is.

172
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,020
Maybe I got too excited ?

173
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,450
Well, it's fine. Managers
 need to think big, after all.

174
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,510
Just pray that Meiwa
doesn't lose this game.

175
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,660


176
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,950
But honestly, what a joke of a principal.

177
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,500
Top of the first inning, despite worries about Shinkawa's pitcher, Koyama...

178
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,010
...he retires the side with just three batters against Meiwa's high-power offense.

179
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,200
Yanagi

180
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,900
The final match in which the 
winner goes to the Koushien...

181
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,610
...is between Meiwa Daiichi High
School and Shinkawa High School.

182
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,780
Bottom of the first, 
Shinkawa is on offense.

183
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,460
What's going on ?
You're watching high school baseball.

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,170
Top of the second,
Meiwa is on offense.

185
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,760
Leading off this inning is the third 
baseman, batting fourth, Tachibana.

186
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,190
Did you find anyone cute ?

187
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,830
I can't find...

188
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,200
You're aiming too high, maybe ?

189
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
...Hikari.

190
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,240
...?

191
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh ? Where is Amamiya ?

192
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,250
We're not sure.

193
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,680
Homerun !

194
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,000
It's a homerun !

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,900
First year, Tachibana hits a monstrous homerun right to the center field display !

196
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,700
Meiwa 1-0 Shinkawa

197
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
All right !

198
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,990
What are you doing here, Amamiya ?

199
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

200
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,150
Meiwa Ichi

201
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,150
Shinkawa

202
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,660
There's no way we could hit that.

203
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,760
That pitcher played center field until last year, right ?

204
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,360
Oh, really ?

205
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,610
In the tournament last year, he threw out three runners at home plate with his strong arm.

206
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm impressed. You've really been a high school baseball nerd since junior high.

207
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,030
I see. No wonder he doesn't
look comfortable on the mound.

208
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,150
He doesn't look comfortable ?

209
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,070
How ?

210
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,330
Strike ! Batter out !

211
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,660
But honestly, those pitches from a lefthander must be difficult to hit.

212
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,480
No, we can do it.

213
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,360
Do you think so ?

214
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,300
We don't know yet if we'll be playing against Shinkawa.

215
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,280
 Don't say such an ominous thing.

216
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,580
Whoever the opponent is,
it's still ominous.

217
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,610
Shoot !

218
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,270
Hey, Nabe !

219
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,000
What kind of a shot was that ?
What are you doing there ?

220
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,480
Akagi !

221
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,820
Yeah, how is it going ?

222
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,630
After five innings, Meiwa is up 1-0.

223
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,150
Just as I figured.

224
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,710
That first year cleanup 
batter hit another homerun.

225
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,540
Tachibana, huh ?
 He really is amazing.

226
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,460
Tachibana...

227
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,870
Tachibana...

228
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,810
Tachibana Hideo...!

229
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:33,020
If you insist on letting Tachibana 
hit fourth, I'll quit the Hakusan Angels.

230
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,100
Are you okay about losing your ace pitcher, Coach ?

231
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,250
Are you going to choose me, 
or Tachibana ? Let's settle it here.

232
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:45,950
...!

233
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,820
Damn him...!

234
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,620
If only he...

235
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,640
If only he hadn't come along...!

236
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,660


237
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,720
Goal !

238
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,850
You should wipe your bloody nose.

239
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,450
All right ! 
Just as expected of Meiwa.

240
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,950
One more hit and
it'll be double-digits.

241
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,800
But they've scored only one run, from Hideo's homerun.

242
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,900
Well, they hit into three
double-plays, after all.

243
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,300
Out !

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,720
But fairly well-hit balls
are all ending up like that.

245
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,400
It must be luck.

246
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,770
It feels ominous.

247
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,350
It'll be fine. They won't be able to score runs off that Meiwa pitcher.

248
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,500
I hope so, too.

249
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,490
Thank you.

250
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,390
...

251
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,730
Eighth inning.

252
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,590
All right !

253
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,750
I have a bad feeling about this.

254
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,900
What are you talking about ?

255
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,050
There's one out in the ninth, and the 
pitcher has only yielded three separate hits.

256
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,450
Just two more outs.
It's probably going to end here.

257
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,750
It's a cakewalk.

258
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,150
The ace pitcher got injured.

259
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,100
The reserve pitcher lacks experience.

260
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
He's fatigued from all the
games up to the final.

261
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,950
Bottom of the ninth,
up by one run.

262
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,990
If he shuts down the opponent this inning, it will be the Koushien.

263
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,490
You're such a worrywart.

264
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,170
Ball. Ball four.

265
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,910
Things aren't turning out well...

266
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,880
It'll be fine.

267
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,930
Safe !

268
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,840
Safe !

269
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,890
After bunt attacks, Shinkawa has the winning run on base.

270
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,590
We're not sure how the game will unfold from here.

271
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,000
Out.

272
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,300
Two outs with runners on second and third in the ninth inning. What would you do ?

273
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,900
Walk the batter and load the bases.

274
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,590
The way the pitcher is pitching right now, a bases loaded walk is a real concern.

275
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,650
Hm.

276
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,550
The count is full.

277
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,070
What would you make him pitch ?

278
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,330
Close your eyes and throw one right down the middle.

279
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,150
I guess.

280
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,920
Now, we know our opponent !

281
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,450
Meiwa Ichi

282
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,500
Don't make faces like that.

283
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,510
What kind of a face are we supposed to make ?

284
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,700
Smile ! Smile !

285
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,500
Now, let's go home and practice ! 
Let's give it our best !

286
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
Things aren't turning out well...

287
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
See ?

00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,070
The star I'm watching today...

307
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,550
...glistened yesterday.

308
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,170
In the town full of things that disappear...

309
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,300
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

310
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:06,280
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

311
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:14,400
...rather than losing our time to regret.

312
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,800
Happiness is not something...

313
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,630
...that someone does for me.

314
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:31,200
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

315
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,850
Do you have the lineup finally set for the game against us ?

316
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,810
If only we could set a solid line up the middle, we could put up a good fight.

317
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,450
So do you have any prospects ?

318
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,660
I have a second baseman in mind. The issue is the center fielder.

319
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,450
The ideal would be someone who runs fast, has a strong arm...

320
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,750
...and knows how to play baseball.

321
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,850
You mean someone who's an overconfident, selfish show-off, on top of all that ?

322
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,640
Next episode of H2 is,
"Defeat Meiwa Daiichi."

Defeat Meiwa Daiichi !

325
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,950
Look forward to it !

00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,540
