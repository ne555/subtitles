Presented by Central Anime

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,440
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,080


13
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,400
 Episode 17

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,400
Hiro is Injured !?

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,400
What Will the Baseball Fan Club Do ?

16
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,790
All right, go !

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,500
Out !

18
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,170
Do you really want
to disband this team ?

19
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,730
I made this promise
to make that happen.

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,500
It's hot.

21
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,310
It's summer.

22
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,780
Strike ! Batter out !

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,630
All right !
All that's left is the ninth inning !

24
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,990
Now, it's getting interesting, Koga !

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,120
...!

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,270
If we win, we'll be a baseball club. If we lose, we'll be disbanded.

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,730
Hm ?

28
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,970
I made this promise
to make that happen.

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,160
Team

30
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,160
Meiwa-Ichi

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,160
Senkawa

32
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,350
So what happens if it's a tie ?

33
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,100
It's already the ninth inning.

34
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,370
Well, it has become
such an interesting game.

35
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,200
Would you like some barley tea ?

36
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,190
No, thank you.

37
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,760
Okay.

38
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,910
Honestly, it's quite impressive that your
 team is keeping our first-string to one run.

39
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,810
Come to think of it, what will
happen if the game ends in a tie ?

40
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,050
My thinking was the game would end in such a way...

41
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,890
...that the loss would result in the dissolution of the club.

42
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,380
Well, of course...

43
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,060
There are no extra innings in this practice game.

44
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,510
If you don't score this inning, we won't win.

45
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,600
And this is a game between the 
prestigious Meiwa and a nameless fan club.

46
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Given your talent and training, you won't embarrass yourselves no matter where you are.

47
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,000
...there's no way you'll 
embarrass yourselves.

48
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,700
Now that you've put a lot of pressure on yourselves, I want to see what you're made of.

49
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,940
Yeah !

50
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,850
What do you think, Kunimi ?

51
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,010
Don't form a circle in a
 game against a fan club.

52
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,270
Well, that aside, we're going to have to face Hideo this inning.

53
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,250
I know.

54
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,540
Then, that's that.

55
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,660
Yeah.

56
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,060
Now, it's the last inning ! 
Everyone, hang in there !

57
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,050
The final inning...

58
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,830
If we keep them scoreless here...

59
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,530
We might have a walkoff win...

60
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,000
Hey ! How much longer are
you going to make us wait ?!

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,910
Just start it already !

62
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,200
All right, let's pull ourselves together !

63
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah !

64
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,410
Team

65
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,410
Meiwa-Ichi

66
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,410
Senkawa

67
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,550
Tachibana will have one more at-bat.

68
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,550
They'll be fine. 
He's going to hold him down.

69
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,400
That's right.

70
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,020
The two hitter.

71
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,100
The three hitter.

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,890
And...

73
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,620
...the four hitter.

74
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,710
Play !

75
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,420
In any case, I can't allow a
 runner before Hideo's at-bat.

76
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,120
Strike !

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,210
Watch out.

78
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,320
I know.

79
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,000
Foul !

80
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,650
This will make it a 
three-pitch strikeout !

81
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Don't underestimate me !

82
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,500
Ball.

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,090
Huh ?

84
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
Meiwa is impressive.

85
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,750
The second time through the lineup,
they're definitely seeing the ball better.

86
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,550


87
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,240
All right !

88
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,110
Right at the shortstop !

89
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,700
All right ! Good job !

90
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,060
Tachibana, how strong
 is that catcher's arm ?

91
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,300
He wouldn't embarrass himself no matter where he is, either.

92
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,150
I see.

93
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,800
Hikari.

94
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes ?

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,980
Do you know the
 next hitter's weakness ?

96
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,200
I don't know.

97
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
I see. 
That's unfortunate.

98
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,130
Sorry.

99
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,900
It's fine.

100
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't touch it !

101
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,900
Safe ! Safe !

102
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,900
All right. Runners are on 
first and second with no outs.

103
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,270
This is how it should be.

104
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,100
In this situation, even 
a single could be fatal.

105
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,550
You're right.

106
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,560
What are we going to do ?

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,060
What are we going to do ?

108
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Should we walk him ?

109
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,240
Hey ! You guys aren't thinking about walking him, are you ?!

110
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,750
Maybe walking him is our only option ?

111
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,540
Surely, loading the bases would make it easier on the defense.

112
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,780
Right...

113
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,750
Switch with me !

114
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,700
Team

115
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,700
Meiwa-Ichi

116
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,700
Senkawa

117
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,730
But we really have played a good game.

118
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,710
That's right.

119
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,230
Yeah.

120
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,450
Of course, we want to pitch to him.

121
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,060
I might get hit.

122
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,050
If it happens, it happens.

123
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,080
Since we're totally relying on you, 
it's not really our place to say, but...

124
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,100
...after coming this far, 
we want to settle the score !

125
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,790
But if we lose, the 
club will be disbanded.

126
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,500
Even if they take the lead here, we still
have our at-bat in the bottom of the inning.

127
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,110
That's how we feel,
but what do you think ?

128
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,330
I'll do my best.

129
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,790
Then let's pull ourselves together !

130
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,580
Yeah !

131
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
The momentum has totally gone to the other side.

132
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,120
Don't worry. 
They only get lucky twice.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,600
We wouldn't have to worry if the upcoming batter was someone who got hits with luck.

134
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,660
We're going to strike him out.

135
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,000
You know who the next
batter is, don't you ?

136
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,700
It's the liquor store's son, right ?

137
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,270
Huh ?

138
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,320
All right.

139
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,680
Kunimi, hang in there !

140
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Strike !

141
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,150
You can do it ! The batter 
was totally late with the swing !

142
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,750
Yes ! The count is 0-2 !

143
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,990
Strike him out with
 three pitches, Kunimi !

144
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,000
This is the first time I've seen
Tachibana swing and miss twice in a row.

145
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,380
Man, that's fast.

146
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,880
The 140-km forkball is coming next.

147
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,490
Yeah, I know.

148
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,000
0-2.

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,990
If you're playing by the book, you're supposed to throw a ball here, Hiro.

150
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,510
Hiro focuses more on command when he throws off the plate.

151
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,620
The location might be difficult,
 but the velocity is a different story.

152
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,700
Don't go for such a pitch !

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,810
On this field, a ball that goes 
over an outfielder will usually be...

154
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,010
I won't make it !

155
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,420


156
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,060
Nice play, Kine.

157
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,040
EYECATCH

158
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,270


159
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,330
I get it. 
You saved us, genius.

160
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,030


161
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,050
I get it. Just get back
 to your position already.

162
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,510
Runners on first and second with one out.

163
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,600
Um, I hate to pester you, but what are
 we going to do in the case of a tie ?

164
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,510
The prestigious Meiwa's baseball club 
plays a tie game against a puny fan club ?

165
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,830
You don't have any confidence that you're going to win ?

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Of course we do.

167
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,000
It will be a problem if it
 becomes an actual club.

168
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,500
That was close...

169
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,150
But the team is still in a tight spot.

170
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,230
It'll be fine, now that the 
most detestable hitter is out !

171
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,290
...!

172
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,600
Note: -san, chan, kun. Our group only uses them for pet names.

173
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,900
Um, Tachibana is such a great guy...

174
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,710
I mean, Mr. Tachibana.

175
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,450
He's a little inflexible, though.

176
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,820
Right, he doesn't back down.

177
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,400
Oh, you can just call him Tachibana.

178
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,540
Hm ? 

179
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,380
One out ! One out !

180
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,210
Yeah !

181
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,300
Complacency is the greatest enemy, Hiro.

182
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,600
We're counting on you, Tamura !

183
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,270
Yeah !

184
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,850
Strike !

185
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,380
All right !

186
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,370
Two more outs.

187
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,990
I'll shut them down and then turn it over
 to our offense in the bottom of the inning.

188
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,590
...!

189
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,650
...!

190
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,000
Out !

191
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,220
Damn ! If it hadn't hit the mound, 
it would've gone through to center !

192
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,180
What bad luck !

193
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,550
Nice job, second baseman !

194
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,740
Okay, two outs ! Two outs !

195
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,800
I'm relieved.

196
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,150
For a moment,
 I thought it hit Kunimi's leg.

197
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,580
It did.

198
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:26,900
Huh ?

199
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,550
Strike !

200
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,060
But it doesn't seem
 to have affected him.

201
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,900
Hiro...

202
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,150
...makes a big fuss 
when it's not a big deal.

203
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,350
But when it really hurts him...

204
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,500
All right ! It went through ! We're in luck !

205
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,970
Safe !

206
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,450
When it really...

207
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,720
When it really hurts, 
Hiro won't tell anyone.

208
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,540
Even a good pitcher will have trouble keeping Meiwa's lineup scoreless the second time through.

209
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,460
It was a meatball right down the pipe.

210
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,600
Well, the Meiwa lineup
 doesn't miss mistake pitches.

211
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,800
Mistake pitch, huh ?

212
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,700
Moron ! 
What're you doing ?!

213
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,620
What are you going to do
 about my super fine play ?!

214
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,700
Hmm...

215
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,380
Meiwa is in luck, I guess.

216
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,940
Then I guess we'll 
have to rely on the sun.

217
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,600
Nice play, second baseman.

218
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,700
Thanks.

219
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,650
I'm glad you showed up, Yanagi.

220
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,300
Thanks to you, we were
 able to play a good game.

221
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Are you going to give up ?

222
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,990
If I could give up so easily, I wouldn't play a game like this to begin with.

223
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,470
You probably shouldn't
talk to him about the leg.

224
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,400
Huh ?

225
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,100
It would be useless to say anything to him until the game is over.

226
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,500
That's how he always is. He never gets treatment.

227
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,300
He gets stubborn for silly reasons.

228
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,510
I see.

229
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes, so...

230
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,000
But I can't do that !

231
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,660
What ?

232
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,310
I'm the manager !

233
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,900
Kunimi, come over here !

234
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,930
Oh, what is it, Manager ?

235
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,600
Just get over here.

236
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,170
Okay...

237
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,550
Now, it's just two runs !

238
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,120
Get runners on base !

239
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,610
It's a tie game if we get a 
runner on and hit a homerun !

240
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,050
We can tie up the game 
with one scoring chance !

241
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,120
Whatever you do,
just get me an at-bat !

242
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,450
If we score three runs, 
we win in a walk-off !

243
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,300
We don't need four runs !

244
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,000
No, I'm going to hit the
bases loaded walk-off homerun !

245
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,430
Kine !

246
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,310
Koga ?

247
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,240
You're the first base coach !

248
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, of course, of course.

249
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,700
First base, first base.

250
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,650
Let's go ! Leading off is the left fielder, hitting ninth, Moriya !

251
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,420
Yeah !

252
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,700
It's such a transparent cheer.

253
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,730
Hmm ?

254
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,900
What is it ?

255
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,320
You've grown up a 
fair amount, it seems.

256
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,070
Shut up.

257
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,830
She's the best manager.

258
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,690
Foul !

259
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,780
But really, we're in a tight spot.

260
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,000
It's just two runs.

261
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,130
Strike !

262
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,320
Strike ! Batter out !

263
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,200
We can tie it with one scoring chance.

264
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,700
Don't worry ! Don't worry !

265
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,710
We're counting on you, Ari !

266
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,510
Yeah !

267
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,060
Safe !

268
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,910
Out !

269
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,900
It's not over yet ! 
Things are just starting !

270
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,450
In baseball, things 
start from two outs !

271
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,700
Of course.

Notes:
Honorifics: We don't use them. This is an English translation.
 They are levels of familiarity among people or status. Examples of what we would use in the translation - 
San = Mr/Mrs.  Sama = Lord/Lady/Sire

As for "chan" and "kun" you could consider them as
using someone's last name with out the "Mr."
 Example: "Hey, Smith, come here." 

Our group only uses them for pet names.  Hikari is an example of using a pet name for Hideo. She calls him "Hide-chan."  And remember the Japanese rarely use given names with each other unless they are close friends or going out.

280
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:32,770
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

281
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:36,700
Notes:
Noda on luck and the sun: This is another one of the homophone puns. Luck, or "tsuki," is a homophone of 
"moon" ["tsuki"]. So since the moon is on Meiwa's side, 
Noda says they have to rely on the sun to be on their side.

282
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:40,620
...rather than the footsteps that


 sound further and further away.

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,220
The star I'm watching today...

289
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,700
...glistened yesterday.

290
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,320
In the town full of things that disappear...

291
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,450
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

292
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:06,400
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

293
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,550
...rather than losing our time to regret.

294
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,950
Happiness is not something...

295
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,780
...that someone does for me.

296
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:31,350
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

297
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,700
Down by two runs, Senkawa has its last turn in the bottom of the ninth.

298
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,120
We can't go down like this. If we win, we'll be an actual baseball club.



299
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,720
Your leg hurts, right ?

300
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,090
It doesn't matter when we've come this far.

301
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,430
We'll have to put our hopes on Hiro's batting in the bottom of the ninth.

302
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,550
All right, Yanagi, get on base !

303
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,130
Then I, Kine Ryutarou, will 
decide the game in the end !
