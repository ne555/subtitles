2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,440
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,450

 Episode 18

14
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,500
A Heated Game in the Bottom of
the Ninth ! The Batter is Kunimi...

15
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,400
The air-conditioners are operating at max.

16
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,880
The road is full of outbound and inbound traffic.

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,550
At the Koushien, high school baseball players are playing heated games.

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,540
But...

19
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,990
It's hot.

20
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,370
It's summer.

21
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,290
A heated game no one knows about is being played here in the ballpark at Meiwa Daiichi.

22
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,040
They're underestimating us. 
They're playing the second-string.

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,510
That's great for us.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,550
The objective of this game is just to win, no matter what the means.

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,550
The objective is not to play a good game, it's just to win, in any way we can.

26
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,870
Yes, we, the Senkawa Baseball Fan Club, have a goal: to win at all costs.

27
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,850
We scored the first run of the game 
on a lucky hit by "Dr. Baseball," Kine.

28
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,610
Do you get it, Kunimi ?
 It's all about willpower !

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,990
Somehow, someway,
we got closer to our goal.

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,750
When we have scoring opportunities, the balls go right at the fielders.

31
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,650
Most of our outs are being made by their 
second baseman and center fielder.

32
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,980
Out !

33
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,760
Hey, good job.

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,900
Shut up !

35
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,250
How much longer are you
going to pitch like a slacker ?

36
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,830
I joined you to beat
 Tachibana, you know ?

37
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,000
If they lose to an ordinary fan club,
 both Meiwa and Hideo will lose face.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,650
You should drag him
into the game already !

39
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,990
Otherwise, I'm going to...

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,810
This is just a show of courtesy.

41
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,350
0:00:50.00 0:00:51.00  

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,990
Team

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,990
Meiwa Ichi

44
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,990
Senkawa

45
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,450
It will be a problem if you lose.

46
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,600


47
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,130
Out.

48
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,350
That was close.

49
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,700
They're becoming serious.

50
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,700
Meiwa isn't so weak as to lose
to a nameless first year pitcher.

51
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,150
Hang in there, Kunimi !

52
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,810
Hey, get serious, Hiro !

53
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,250
Hiro ?

54
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,330
Kunimi Hiro ?

55
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,250
Timeout !

56
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,500
I was hoping that they might wait for another inning.

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,860
I thought he injured his elbow and quit.

58
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,250
Lots of things happened.

59
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah !

60
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,550
Shall I be honest with you, Tachibana ?

61
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,310
When I saw Seinan Junior High play, I wanted him more than you.

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,460
More than you, who hits fourth as a first year on the prestigious Meiwa team.

63
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,560
I'm not surprised at all.

64
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm counting on you...

65
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,880
...my best friend.

66
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,400
Foul !

67
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,270
You're putting on such a 
powerful swing, best friend.

68
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,750
As always, you're stubborn.

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,400
Here.

70
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,000
I feel like this game is why
I've been playing baseball.

71
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,470
You must be imagining things.

72
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,600
This is just a worthless practice game, so let's settle down, okay ?

73
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,170
You rascal !

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,900
Foul !

75
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,230
Hey now. What are you 
aiming for with that swing ?

76
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,630
With that swing, you mean to say that you won't be happy with just getting a hit ?

77
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,000
If I just aim for a single, I feel like I'll be late on the swing.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Oh, come on now.

79
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,000
Moron ! Don't call
 for such a stupid pitch !

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,270
Just set up right down the middle !

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,450
Crap.

82
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,940
That's right. He has his strikeout pitch, the 140 km forkball.

83
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,500
Here it comes, Hideo !

84
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,760
That moron. The count is 0-2, with no runners on.

85
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,000
With nothing to lose, it would
have been an interesting pitch.

86
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,510
Hit it if you can !

87
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,900
It fell. The pitch
Hiro threw definitely fell.

88
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,250
The 140-km forkball ! Damn him !

89
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,370
But Hideo successfully hit it.

90
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,800
If it's a single, I'll take it.

91
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,510
I'm going to catch that 
guy's hit even if it kills me !

92
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,550
Kine was going to catch it even if it killed him, but...

93
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,000
...he lay on the field.

94
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,740
Top of the seventh, 
Meiwa scored its first run.

95
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,550
The score is finally tied !

96
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,350
You shouldn't be happy with a tie.

97
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,190
Team

98
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,190
Meiwa Ichi

99
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,190
Senkawa

100
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,900
If we win, we'll be a baseball club. If we lose, we'll be disbanded.

101
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,340
So what happens if it's a tie ?

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,600
There are no extra innings in this game.

103
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,550
Top of the ninth, we're facing Meiwa's cleanup hitter, Tachibana Hideo.

104
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,240
Don't go for such a pitch !

105
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,500
When he said he'd catch 
Hideo's hit even if it kills him...

106
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,700
...Kine wasn't lying.

107
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,100
Nice play, Kine.

108
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,780
But then...

109
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,900
For a moment,
 I thought it hit Kunimi's leg.

110
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,160
It did.

111
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,550
He makes a big fuss 
when it's not a big deal.

112
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,990
When it really hurts, 
he won't tell anyone.

113
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,330
Safe !

114
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,450
Meiwa is in luck, I guess.

115
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,030
Then I guess we'll 
have to rely on the sun.

116
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,450
Nice play, second baseman.

117
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,700
I'm glad you showed up, Yanagi.

118
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,000
Thanks to you, we were
 able to play a good game.

119
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,090
Are you going to give up ?

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,370
If I could give up so easily, I wouldn't play a game like this to begin with.

121
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,940
Down by two runs, 
we have one inning left.

122
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,800
Strike ! Batter out !

123
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,600
Two more outs left.

124
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,160
Safe !

125
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,980
Out !

126
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,030
No, just one.

127
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,900
In this game, which stakes the promotion of this fan club to an actual club...

128
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,300
...we're down by two runs.

129
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,060
In the batter's box is 
a guy who caught a cold.

130
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,930
Is the fan club going to be 
able to make a comeback ?!

131
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,030
What're you being a commentator for ?

132
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,510
Foul !

133
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,890
One more out.

134
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,030
Or rather, one more pitch, now that the count is 1-2.

135
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,000
1-2...

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,350
It's not over yet.

137
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,670
In terms of a pitcher's psychology, 
he's definitely going for a strikeout.

138
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,690
Foul !

139
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,450
Ball !

140
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,300
Foul !

141
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,120
Foul !

142
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,400
This is where you show your 
specialty, guy who a caught cold.

143
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,980
Meiwa's ace pitcher, you won't be able to strike this batter out.

144
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,100
He's peerless in his 
ability to foul off pitches.

145
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:50,800
Foul !

146
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,750
Foul !

147
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,590
We'll leave the second base open.

148
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,060
You should go against 
your parent for once.

149
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,350
A filial bond shouldn't
 be a one-way street.

150
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,620
It won't be a good tie if it 
isn't pulled from both sides.

151
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,200
How many pitches are left now ?

152
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,790
It's the next pitch.

153
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,500
Ball four.

154
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,950
All right !

155
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,800
Kunimi in the ninth inning, the most dependable hitter, gets his at-bat !

156
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,700
If not for the leg injury...

157
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,400
I guess he was injured.

158
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,050
Kunimi ! Hit a homerun !

159
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,660
If you hit a homerun,
you won't have to run !

160
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,680
It's probably impossible to hit it over the fence, since there are two fields in one here.

161
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,000
Kunimi, just think about getting on base. Okay ?

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,060
I'm the featured actor !

163
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,270
I don't have such a margin for error that lets me give up the lead role.

164
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,000


165
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,350
EYECATCH

166
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,400
Oh, did you know ?

167
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,680
Our school doesn't have a baseball club, but it has a baseball fan club.

168
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,880
Oh, I see.

169
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,450
I love high school baseball, so I'm 
working as their manager starting today.

170
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,700
What're you gonna do ?

171
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,490
About what ?

172
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,300
It goes without saying.

173
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,850
It goes without saying.

174
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,400
Let's make the history of this
 school's baseball club ourselves.

175
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,370
The Koushien doesn't matter. 
We can play baseball again.

176
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,390
You and me, the golden battery.

177
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,120
I don't have any complaints.

178
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,990
Let's surprise those 
powerhouse baseball schools !

179
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,430
All right, let's do it.

180
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,160
Strike !

181
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,800
You were totally fooled 
by a breaking pitch.

182
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,870
That battery must have
thought the same, too.

183
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,320
All right, the same pitch !

184
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,000
Foul !

185
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,470
That was close.

186
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,660
That was a homerun.

187
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,820
It had the distance.

188
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,650
In a normal ballpark, it would've
been on the fair side of the pole...

189
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,700
...and into the stands, before it hooked into foul territory.

190
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,040
Now that he's our opponent, he teaches me all over again just how scary a hitter he is.

191
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:24,820


192
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,050
Dammit. I was 
gambling on that one pitch.

193
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,150
If you take away baseball, you've got nothing left.

194
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,170
If you're a man, you should stick to the path you've determined for yourself.

195
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,090
Hey...

196
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,640
Don't turn your back midway through your journey.

197
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,700
When you go down, you go head-first.

198
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,660
You should cure your elbow pain with your willpower.

199
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,700
Don't look at me with 
such a scary expression.

200
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,790
So you're going to get me out 
with that pitch no matter what ?

201
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,400
I like that personality.

202
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,740
That's how an ace pitcher should be.

203
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:16,640


204
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,610
Get through !

205
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,100
Safe !

206
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,200
Runners on first and third with two outs.

207
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,700
Batting fourth, center fielder, Kine.

208
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,950
We're sending Satou as a 
pinch-runner for the first base runner.

209
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,990
Star players get a great stage.

210
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,640
Of course.

211
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,940
Kine, do your best !

212
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,350
Listen, if you hit a homerun, we'll have a walkoff win !

213
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,700
If I hit a homerun...

214
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,400
...you're going on a date with me !

215
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,350
Okay, sure.

216
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,370
Anyway, we're counting on you, Kine !

217
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,360
What ? What ?

218
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,660
Including a kiss !

219
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,960
Of course ! Of course !

220
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,270
What ? What ?

221
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,740
You can have my kiss, too !

222
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,910
Just do something !

223
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,480
It's a promise, Koga !

224
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,370
Ugh ! Okay then !

225
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,000
We're leaving it to you !

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,970
Count on me !

227
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,200
What's wrong ?

228
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,720
This definitely isn't it.

229
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,600
This isn't it !

230
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,200
Huh ?

231
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,000
Remember how I used to swing !

232
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,300
Just because I had a long hiatus, this isn't how it should be !

233
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,990
Just remember !

234
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,810
Batter up !

235
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,730
Wait a sec !

236
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,250
I thought you used to hit lefty when you were with the Hakusan Angels.

237
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,450
Moron. I was...

238
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,130
...a big fan of Kakefu...

239
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,150
See, this is the sound !

240
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,800
You can't see a sound.

241
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,700
Batter !

242
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,720
Yeah !

243
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,300
He might actually hit it.


244
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,000
There won't be many 
homeruns on this field.

245
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,250
I think...

246
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,510
There's an inside-the-park homerun, though.

247
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,860
But I might want to give him a kiss if he 
hits a come-from-behind walkoff homerun.

248
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,120


249
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,990
I'm Kakefu !

250
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,150
Strike !

251
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,950
Watch the ball, will you ?

252
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,450
Hey, Kakefu !

253
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,400
Even if your swing is sharp, you 
won't get a hit if your timing is off !

254
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,030
That's what the 
battery will think, too.

255
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,630
Moron !

256
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,270
Strike two !

257
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,030
You bait him to throw the same pitch, but
 you swing and miss that pitch ? That's silly.

258
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,550
It looks like he's going to swing and miss again.

259
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,510
That's what the
battery will think, too.

260
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,850
Don't underestimate me !

261
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,500
Crap, it's a fastball...

262
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,540
Go !

263
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,950
It's gone through !

264
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,530
The guy with a cold scores. The lead is down to one.

265
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,650
Runners on second and third.

266
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,380
He did it.

267
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,400
Even though it didn't result in a date...

268
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Right.

269
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,480
What a game...!

270
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
Yeah. I'm gonna kiss him.

271
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,250
I'm glad I kept playing baseball for three years of high school.

272
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,470
It's not over yet, Seniors.

273
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,200
If they intentionally walk Noda, it'll be your turn.

274
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,200
Huh ?

275
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,650
What...?

276
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,530
How many more pitches to go ?

277
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,300
Two outs ! Two outs !

278
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,160
Batting fifth is the catcher, Noda, 
who should actually be hitting fourth.

279
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,870
Noda.

280
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,450
When the club gets funding, we should buy a helmet for left-handed hitters.

281
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,500
And catcher's gear, too.

282
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,350
First base is open, Coach.

283
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,420
Nice game.

284
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,030

292
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:31,000
Notes:
Noda on Luck and the Sun: This is another one of the homophone puns. Luck, or "tsuki," is a homophone of 
"moon" ["tsuki"], so since the moon is on Meiwa's side,
 Noda says they have to rely on the sun to be on their side.

293
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,900
I want you to let me hear you


come closer and open the door...

294
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,830
Notes:
 Kakefu was the famous cleanup hitter for the Hanshin Tigers
 in the 80's, back when the Tigers won the championship.

295
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:41,750
...rather than the footsteps that


 sound further and further away.

301
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,350
The star I'm watching today...

302
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,830
...glistened yesterday.

303
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,450
In the town full of things that disappear...

304
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,580
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

305
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,560
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

306
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:15,680
...rather than losing our time to regret.

307
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,080
Happiness is not something...

308
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,910
...that someone does for me.

309
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:32,480
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

310
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,000
Is he going to become the last batter ?

311
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,110
Noda, the game is
approaching its finale.

312
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,810
Until the very end, we won't let up !

313
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,060
That's right. We shouldn't give up until the last out.

314
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,010
But what if the umpire 
makes a bad call ?

315
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,650
What ? What do you mean ?

316
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,650
People with discerning
eyes do watch closely.

317
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,250
What do you mean ?
