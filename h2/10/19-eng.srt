2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,460
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,190
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,200
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,140
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,210
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,780
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,440
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,760

A Come-From-Behind Win !

The Senkawa Baseball Club Is Born ?

16
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,260
Fair !

17
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey, best friend !

18
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,550
Out !

19
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,650
Yes...!

20
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,040
We did it ! We did it !

21
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,700
Three outs !

22
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,930
Game set !

23
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,250
Nice game.

24
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,000
Team

25
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,000

Senkawa

27
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,930
With the score of 3-2,
Meiwa High School wins.

28
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,780
Thank you.

29
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,220
It was a great game.
Guys, you did great.

30
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,500
Dammit...

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
We were just a step short...

32
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,090
If we play again, we won't lose...

33
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,000
That's right. We want
 to win next time, right ?

34
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm going to negotiate with 
the principal one more time.

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,790
Okay ?

36
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,260
Yeah !

37
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,650
I vote for Koga.

38
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,200
Damn that Tachibana...

39
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,350
I'm going to leave
him speechless next time.

40
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,900
Manager...

41
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,700
A promise is a promise.

42
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,400
True.

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,240
Then, if the "fan club" gets dissolved, 
how about creating a "fan association" ?

44
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,580
Isn't that a great idea ?

45
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,200
Hey...!

46
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
Hey, wait ! Wait !

47
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,530
Wait up !

48
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,450
Wait up !

49
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm foolish, aren't I ?

50
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,300
I say all kinds of unnecessary things.

51
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,700
Would you like to go and eat some ice cream ?

52
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,800
Um, thank you.

53
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,260
But I have to clean up.

54
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,260
She's the best manager.

55
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,930
Well, that last play was a close call.

56
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,290
Honestly.

57
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,720
It was an out.

58
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,050
Hey, no one's
complaining about your call.

59
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,200
Yeah. Just by a hair.

60
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,610
The out was definitely a fair call.

61
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,800
If only the foot wasn't
off the bag, that is.

62
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,350
Huh ?

63
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,250
But it's okay.

64
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,550
Whether it's boxing or soccer...

65
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,250
...when you're playing on the road, you 
have to expect calls to go the other way.

66
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,090
Is that true ?

67
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,630
But we had a narrow escape.

68
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,250
Even though it was
just a practice game...

69
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,730
...it would be a huge problem if our 
first-string were to lose to a puny fan club.

70
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,300
That's right.

71
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,010
Good call.

72
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,590
Yeah.

73
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,250
See you.

74
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,240
Okay.

75
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Ugh !

76
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,800
W...who did that ?!

77
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,880
Meiwa Daiichi High School

78
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,880
Baseball Club Camp Hall

79
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,520
This is a prestigious high school baseball school...

80
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, you were in the restroom ?

81
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,000
Would you like something cold to drink inside ?

82
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,610
There's a hornet's nest on top of that school building.

83
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,290
Oh, let's take a look.

84
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,760
Oh, it's true.

85
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,120
I'm surprised that
you can see that far.

86
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,040
Yes, I'm fortunate to have good eyes.

87
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,290
So if the fan club isn't okay,
what about a secret society ?

88
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,800
It's a great idea, isn't it ?

89
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,450
Is your leg okay ?

90
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,520
Yeah.

91
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,250
Welcome home.

92
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,650
Is your cold better ?

93
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Sousei High School Graduation Commemoration

94
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,350
Aren't you going to ask why
I hate high school baseball ?

95
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,980
No. It's probably a
silly reason, anyway.

96
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,880
You came close, Kunimi.

97
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,650
Ouch...

98
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,850
You should really have
a doctor take a look at it.

99
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,890
It would be bad if you
have a bone fracture.

100
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,600
It's no trouble at all.

101
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,400
I'll be hospitalized or
do whatever they want.

102
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,730
I have nothing to do
 from now on, anyway.

103
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,150
What are you sulking for ?

104
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,100
It was a ridiculous condition to begin with,
so there's no reason to adhere to it anyway.

105
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,700
Easy for you to say.

106
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,500
"A promise is a promise" ?

107
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,700
It almost made me laugh.

108
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,610
I can't believe you'd 
say something like that.

109
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,450
What ?

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,150
Ah, damn...

111
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,000
You guys came close.

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,400
If it had gone through, it would have
 been a come-from-behind walkoff win.

113
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,160
Tachibana, I'm moved by your fair play.

114
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,520
Thanks.

115
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,290
Hey, transfer to our school.

116
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,350
Let's play baseball together again.

117
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,890
It's too late for that.

118
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,450
I've learned how fun it is
to pitch against you.

119
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,650
Aim for the Koushien !
Tachibana Hideo

120
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,210
Hey, you're trying
 to look cool again !

121
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,240
It's too early to give up, Noda.

122
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,250
Huh ?

123
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,000
It was a ridiculous condition to begin with,
so there's no reason to adhere to it anyway.

124
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,820
Who said that ?

125
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,600
Anyway, let's find another way.

126
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,300
Then, why don't you dissolve the
fan club and start a fan association ?

127
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,770
Your brain is on the
same level as Kine's.

128
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,360
Don't compare me to that guy !

129
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,440
You don't have any other ideas ?

130
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,940
To refresh our mind, let's watch a wonderful video !

131
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,260
Hey...

132
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,530
Um, I mean, we should rest our overworked brains.

133
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,280


134
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,640
Hm ?

135
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,640
Yanagi...

136
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:45,950
Eyecatch

137
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,700
Wow, you're impressive, Mo-kkun.

138
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,890
I love baseball !

139
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,340
The high school I graduated from is going to the Koushien. Isn't that amazing, Mo-kkun ?

140
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah, that's amazing !

141
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,270
Let's go watch together.

142
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah !

143
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,150
Yay, the Koushien ! The Koushien !

144
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
Sousei

145
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
I have a great idea !

146
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,730
Well ? Don't you think it's a good idea ?

147
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,600
I see.

148
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,830
So up until ten years ago, your
 father played catch with you.

149
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,270
Yeah.

150
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,310
So he changed after the lopsided loss 
of his alma mater, Sousei High School.

151
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,200
That he showed his son
 such an embarrassing game...

152
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,300
...also contributed to
 his hatred of baseball ?

153
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,600
Hey...

154
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,000
He's a proud man, after all.

155
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,900
Hey, are you listening
to what I'm saying ?

156
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,280
Shut up. If you want 
to do it, just do it.

157
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,000
Yanagi, just give him your home phone number.

158
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,750
I'm surprised that he was a Giants fan.

159
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,750
Geez.

160
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,000
He especially liked Egawa.

161
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,600
Yes, Yanagi speaking.

162
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,730
Don't say anything.
Just do what I tell you.

163
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,200
We have your treasured son.

164
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,100
If you want him back safely, create a
 baseball club at Senkawa High School.

165
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,600
Maybe if we get Egawa to ask him, your father might say yes.

166
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,810
How are we going to ask Egawa to ask his father ?

167
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,910
Um...

168
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,100
Got that ?

169
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,570
Got that ?

170
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,450
So all I have to do is
create a baseball club ?

171
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,060
That's right.

172
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,250
See ? 
It's amazing, isn't it, Mo-kkun ?

173
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,390
Yeah ! It's amazing !

174
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,290
Got that ?

175
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,800
I got it. I'll do as you say.

176
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,390
I have an autographed ball from Mr. Hara.

177
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,840
Mr. Hara...

178
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,050
Are you satisfied ?

179
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,150
It was a waste of time, 
so think more seriously.

180
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,900
He says he'll create it.

181
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,020
Create what ?

182
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,530
Senkawa High School's baseball club.

183
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,360
Ten years...

184
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,890
It must be a silly reason, anyway.

185
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,610
He may be right.

186
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,400
Noda ! If you're joking,
I won't forgive you !

187
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,300
He wouldn't joke.

188
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
My father.

189
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,220
Then hurry.

190
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,100
That's right. You should go home
 before he changes his mind, Hostage.

191
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,580


192
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,650
Hiro, you should hurry, too.

193
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,880
Me ?

194
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,440
There's someone who's waiting anxiously for this news more than anyone.

195
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,750
Yeah, there is !

196
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,650
Noda, you should call everyone
 in the fan club and let them know.

197
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,200
Okay...

198
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,960
Hey, don't boss us around.

199
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,650
Just go !

200
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,540
Okay...

201
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,570
Crud, a phone call should be enough.

202
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,510
Why should I go through all 
this trouble to go there myself ?

203
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,170
I'm injured, you know ?

204
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,490
I thought she lived around here...

205
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,600
Koga

206
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,360
I guess I'll call instead.

207
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,190
...!

208
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,640
Oh, no.

209
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,810
Hey, be quiet !

210
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,260
Sorry, Third.

211
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,560
I forgot to feed you...

212
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,200
...?

213
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,320
Hey, Manager !

214
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,690
Kunimi ?

215
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,500
What brings you here so late ?

216
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,940
Well, I wasn't eager to do it, either.

217
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,870
But I have something 
I need to report to you.

218
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,150
Report ?

219
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,150
Um, I'm sorry. I've been
 preoccupied with my own issues.

220
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,340
Does your leg hurt ?
Was it a bad injury ?

221
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,970
No, that's not it.

222
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,200
I'm thinking about transferring.

223
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,200
To a school that has a baseball club.

224
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,990
I see.

225
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,430
It's Senkawa High School Baseball Club.

226
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,670
You should definitely continue playing baseball, Kunimi.

227
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,850
What ?

228
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,400
I'll cheer for you even if
 you play for another school.

229
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,810
Even if I can't be the manager.

230
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,650
Um, it's Senkawa's baseball club.

231
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,900
Well, I don't know 
Senkawa's baseball club, but...

232
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,200
What ? Senkawa ?

233
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,650
The principal says he'll create one.

234
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,650
What ? What ?

235
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,590
This is it ! 
This is how it should feel !

236
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,650
Dammit !

237
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,250
I finally...

238
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,650
...regained...

239
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,050
...my...

240
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:24,800
Iguchi Batting Center

241
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:24,800
200 yen per game
25 pitches

242
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,050
...batting swing !

243
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,500
You're in a baseball
 club somewhere ?

244
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,590
I'm in the soccer club !

245
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,200
What ? Soccer club ?

246
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,300
Mister !
 I need some change !

247
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,400
We're going to hit a lot !

248
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,800
Oh, it's Kine !

249
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,860
Whaddya know.
You're here, too ?

250
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,450
You guys are in
the soccer club, too ?

251
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,350
No...

252
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,940
...the baseball club !

253
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,970
Right ?

254
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,730
Huh ?

255
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,900
The demand that the guys
 who kidnapped you made...

256
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,780
...was just to create 
a baseball club, right ?

257
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,220
Um, yeah.

258
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,800
I wasn't told that I had 
to let you play baseball.

259
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,330
What're you going to do ?

260
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,950
Do you want to be kidnapped again ?

261
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,070
I'll demand it myself.

262
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,900
Please let me play baseball.

263
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,760
I love baseball.

264
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,660
As much as you do, Father.

265
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,900
There is one condition.

266
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
Wash my back.

267
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll get to play him again.

268
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,650
Aim for the Koushien ! 
Tachibana Hideo

269
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,100
Is that really true ?

270
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,860
It really is genuinely true.

271
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,120
Is that really genuinely honestly true ?

272
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,650
It really is genuinely...

273
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,790
Anyway, it is true.

274
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,910
Then I can rejoice ?

275
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,170
Yes, you can.

276
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,980
I can really rejoice...?

277
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,870
Manager !

278
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,680
Yes ! I'm Koga Haruka, the manager of Senkawa High School's baseball club !

Yanagi's first name is "Morimichi." "Mo-kkun" is a short name that combines "Mo" and the address, "kun."


Egawa and Hara were two of the major players on the Giants squad in the 80's.

287

295
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,320
The star I'm watching today...

296
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,800
...glistened yesterday.

297
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,420
In the town full of things that disappear...

298
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,550
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

299
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:05,500
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

300
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:13,650
...rather than losing our time to regret.

301
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,050
Happiness is not something...

302
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,880
...that someone does for me.

303
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:30,450
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

304
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,650
Hiro, you should go see a doctor.

305
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,400
You should have your
 leg properly looked at.

306
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,170
Even though the baseball club is created, maybe I have a leg made of glass ?

307
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,070
Hey, don't make such a bad joke. People are worried about you.

308
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,500
Hikari, please scold him hard. He won't listen to me.

309
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,820
Hey, why are you two pressuring me from both sides ?

310
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,990
Don't run away, Kunimi Hiro !
 Prepare yourself !

311
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,910
Next episode of H2 is,

Next episode of H2 is

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Pursuit ! Hiro vs. Haruka

314
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Look forward to it !

315
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,380
Are you having a refreshing workout ?
