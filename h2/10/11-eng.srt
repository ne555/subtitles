2
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,300
I don't know what it is...

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,420
...but I have to say something to you.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:47,150
Ah, hidden deep inside my heart...

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,160
...a strange box is making a noise now.

6
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

7
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,100
The game starts now.

8
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,170
One down, two down, but I can still go on.

9
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,240
It makes my heart bound.

10
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,740
When going against the wind, throw your chest out more.

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,400
At last, with a bang, it's a rainbow grand slam.

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,230


13
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,600
 Episode 11

14
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,600
Defeat Meiwa Daiichi !

15
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,080
Ball four !

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,680
Bottom of the ninth, Shinkawa gets a runner on board with one out to sustain their hopes.

17
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,780
What happens from here is the problem.

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,650
Yeah.

19
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,150
The pitcher throws his first pitch.

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,420
Oh, it's a bunt !

21
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,940
He's not very good at fielding.

22
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,700
He's a reserve pitcher, after all.

23
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,460
Safe !

24
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,200
He didn't have to press.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,550
All he needed to do was to
make sure that he got an out.

26
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,600
But he pressed to protect the lead.

27
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,900
After that, they do a sacrifice bunt...

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,250
...and move the runners over to second and third with two outs.

29
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,550
Will this be the final pitch ?

30
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,000
It's popped up !

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,700
That was poorly hit.

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,300
Oh, it fell in ! It fell in !

33
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,200
It's a walkoff ! It's a walkoff hit !

34
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,900
With two outs, the runners are moving on contact...

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,380
...so the second base
runner also scored easily.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,850
Shinkawa gains the ticket to the Koushien !

37
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,430
2-1, a come from 
behind walkoff victory.

38
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,250
Goodbye to the Koushien.

39
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh, well.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,300
Shut up.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,970
Aren't you supposed to be my friends ?

42
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,000
Why don't you try to be considerate to me and say something to console me or something ?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,220
You shut up.

44
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,000
We're the ones who are 
really depressed about this.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
That's right.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,540
Huh ?

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,410
Oh, I didn't know that you were pulling for me so earnestly.

48
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,700
I've never cheered for someone
else's team as much as I did this time.

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,000
I definitely wanted you
to go to the Koushien.

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,650
You guys...

51
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,690
You really are my best friends...

52
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,440
I mean, I'd get it if Shinkawa 
were overwhelmingly superior.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
Huh ?

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,020
But that was an opponent you could win seven out of ten games from.

55
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,300
What ?

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Bungler.

57
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,780
It couldn't be helped.
You only get one shot.

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,650
Oh well, what are we 
going to do about it ?

59
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,880
That's right.

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,710
What're you talking about ?

61
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,200
Shut up.

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,690
The batting lineup is still on a roll.

63
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,250
That second year pitcher will probably learn from this loss and grow.

64
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,200
It's going to be a problem.

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,230
It's going to be a problem ?
For whom ?

66
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,540
For us, that's who !

67
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,550
Huh ?

68
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,510
What're you talking about ?

69
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,130
Shut up, blockhead !

70
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,700
What's wrong with you ?

71
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,150
I said you're a blockhead
because you are !

72
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,990
That's right.

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,400
What ? What's that about ?

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,000
His club becomes official if they win against our club, and abolished if they lose ?

75
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,930
That principal is so terrible !

76
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,400
That condition is 
nothing short of malicious.

77
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,710
I don't know about that.

78
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,200
What do you mean ?

79
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,710
You saw them play against the soccer club sometime ago, didn't you ?

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,680
There's no way they'll win.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,650
But this time, Hiro is the starter.

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,700
Baseball is played by nine people.

83
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,350
We have eighty members, though.

84
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,710
I don't know what they're thinking.

85
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,130
Hey, why don't you lose to them ? 
It's just a practice game.

86
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,350
For us, it is.

87
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,940
But for them, it's not. 
They'll be serious.

88
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,560
They'll be playing really hard.

89
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,790
It'd be disrespectful for us to go easy on such an opponent.

90
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,700
You don't want Hiro to play baseball ?

91
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,300
I don't want him to, since we want to go to the Koushien next year.

92
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,660
Hide-chan !

93
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,460
It's Meiwa, isn't it ?

94
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,480
Yeah.

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,650
If we lose, we won't even be able to play catch.

96
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,860
That's right.

97
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,120
What are we going to do ?

98
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
It's easy.

99
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,720
Huh ?

100
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,050
We just need to win.

101
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,990
Can we win ?

102
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,390
Can we win ?

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,830
Can we win ?

104
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,340
Hey.

105
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,970
You heard about it 
from your father, right ?

106
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,010
It sounds like you're in trouble.

107
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,700
The game is ten days from now. At Meiwa's field. Okay ?

108
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,970
But I...

109
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,130
At least once !

110
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,500
At least once in your lifetime, you
 should rebel against your parents.

111
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,550
A filial tie isn't supposed to be one-way.

112
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,430
Isn't that right ?


113
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,700
As it is, your father will never
understand your true feelings.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,000
And you won't understand the real 
reason that your father dislikes baseball.

115
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,420
Adults are like that.

116
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,430
His real reason ?

117
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,540
Yeah.

118
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,480
Adults are fixated on saving face.

119
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,000
It might just be that he 
hasn't had the opportunity...

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,050
...to take down the billboard that says "I dislike high school baseball,"...

121
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,990
...which is affirmed by both
himself and the people around him.

122
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,450
Really, whether it's baseball or something else...

123
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,180
...it's strange to say that he
dislikes people who work hard.

124
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,590
Anyway, what's clear is that, in order to show your father a good game...

125
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,590
...we desperately need you to play second base.

126
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,370
But I...

127
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,750
We'll keep second
base open for you.

128
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,170
See you.

129
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,350
Kunimi.

130
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,540
The tie will loosen if you don't
tighten it from both sides, Yanagi !

131
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,450
How did I do ?

132
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,700
I think it was kind of persuasive.

133
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,340
The part about "filial tie" may have been a little too corny.

134
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,300
No, that was just about right for him.

135
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,850
I wonder if he'll come.

136
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,250
It's all a gamble.

137
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,720
Recruiting him to be the second baseman, or defeating Meiwa.

138
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,290
A gamble...

139
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,670
Hey, Fan Club guys.

140
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,020
Are you discussing what to do
after your fan club gets abolished ?

141
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,450
Yeah. We're playing 
against Meiwa, after all.

142
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,110
And Hideo.

143
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,650
Well, Koga won't have to worry.

144
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,320
Our soccer club will 
responsibly take her.

145
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,200
You seem to have lots of free time.

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,530
What happened to the 
Inter-High Tournament ?

147
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,660
The real soccer season 
starts on New Year's Day.

148
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,180
You should sit at your kotatsu eating your mikan, and watch my great performance on TV.

149
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,800
It'll be abolished ! Abolished !

150
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,320
The Fan Club will be disbanded !

151
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,400
Hooray !

152
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,320
What happened to the Inter-High ?

153
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,650
The first baseman will be Hironaga.

154
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,190
The shortstop will be Arikawa, even 
though he doesn't have a strong arm.

155
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,900
The right fielder will be Nemoto, for the time being.

156
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,590
So the left fielder will be Yamaguchi ?

157
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,650
Wait.

158
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,820
If that's the case, 
who will play third base ?

159
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,060
Hmm...

160
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,600
We need at least one more player !

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,580
If we don't have at least one more
decent player, it won't even be a game !

162
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,680
Man, we're in trouble.

163
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,500
Hey, whatever the case, isn't it unusual to discuss strategies at your opponent's house ?

164
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,510
Shut up.

165
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,830
You should give us something cold to drink, instead of just drinking by yourself.

166
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,200
You have plenty to sell, right ?

167
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,100
That's right.

168
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,860
There's a vending machine outside.

169
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,800
Hideo, you jerk !

170
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,510
You can't drink alcohol until you're twenty.

171
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,150
EYECATCH

172
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,550
Amamiya

173
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,600
This air-conditioning is kind of weak.

174
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,650
Hey, just because 
it's summer break...

175
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,890
...does that mean you can take it easy and look at those things ?

176
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,290
Huh ?

177
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,700
If you lose the game
against our school...

178
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,150
...you won't be able to play baseball for all three years of high school, right ?

179
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,710
Hideo told you ?

180
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,730
That's right.
What's going on with you ?

181
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,110
You don't have time to be 
doing stuff like this, do you ?

182
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,400
Shut up. You don't need to tell me; I already know.

183
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,420
But you look calm and composed.

184
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm going to practice shortly.

185
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
Oh, I see. I appreciate your effort in this hot weather.

186
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,830
Honestly.

187
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,630
Okay.

188
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,320
I will give you permission to use
the field until the day of the game.

189
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,320
The time you will be allowed to use the
field is, let's see, between 11 and 2 o'clock.

190
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,200
The principal really is thoughtful.

191
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,580
He chose the hottest
time of day on purpose.

192
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,190
That's fine, isn't it ?

193
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,550
You'll get to practice and also
develop your mental toughness.

194
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,500
You should show a little empathy.

195
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
You should realize 
that winning takes effort.

196
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,340
After all, our school is
extraordinarily strong.

197
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,150
Whatever. 
Thanks for the advice.

198
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,710
You're welcome. 
Well, good luck.

199
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,830
All you have is baseball, anyway.

200
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,550
Crud.

201
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,000
You can give Hideo
 food poisoning, if you want.

202
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
I give you the permission to do so.

203
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,900
I'll think about it.

204
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,350
Oh, yes.

205
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,750
What happened to you, with the 
Archery Club's regional tournament ?

206
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,720
Eh ?

207
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,750
Don't just stick out your glove.

208
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,880
You could have fielded
it in front of your body.

209
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,300
Even if you can't catch it, you can do something with it if you keep it in front of you.

210
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,970
Yeah !

211
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,550
Here ! One more !

212
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,760
Did you decide on the starting lineup ?

213
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,700
It doesn't matter what I decide. We have just enough members to play the game.

214
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,090
Here.

215
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,980
Thanks.

216
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't make a face like that.

217
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,220
They really love baseball.

218
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,700
Dammit !

219
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,500
I know.

220
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,360
Eight days left.

221
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,560
If we could at least solidify the middle, we could put up a good fight.

222
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,800
Noda is the catcher. 
Kunimi is the pitcher.

223
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,460
Let's hope that Yanagi will be the second baseman.

224
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,380
The problem is center field.

225
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,900
Yeah, we want someone who runs fast, has a strong arm, and knows how to play baseball.

226
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:58,500
And someone who's overconfident, 
selfish, disagreeable, and a showoff...?

227
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,090
I refuse.

228
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,900
Why ?

229
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,860
You said you were going to cooperate
with us if we'd bow and ask for your help.

230
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,760
Right.

231
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,400
That's why you should
have bought me then.

232
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,370
The value of a person goes up and down.

233
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,770
For a game that decides 
the fate of the Fan Club...

234
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,800
...I can't sell myself so cheaply.

235
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,820
How much has it gone up ?

236
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,650
Let's see.

237
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,400
A day-long date with Koga.

238
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,880
Including a kiss.

239
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,600
No way !

240
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,990
Damn. I wish you'd think for a while before you answer.

241
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,030
Sorry to bother you.

242
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,650
Are you sure ?

243
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,510
If you need me,
now is your chance !

244
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,600
The closer it gets to the game, the higher my price goes !

245
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,300
A day-long date with a kiss won't be enough then !

246
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,910
It's going to be an overnight date. And it includes...

247
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,560
Goal !

248
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,300
Should I have thought 
about it a little more ?

249
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,500
There's no reason for you to waste the precious time of your youth.

250
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
But you need him, right ?

251
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,200
What I need is someone who runs fast, has a strong arm, and knows how to play baseball...

252
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,600
...and who's overconfident, selfish, disagreeable, and a showoff. That's all.

253
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,650
I don't need someone who's so mean as to take advantage of other people's misery.

254
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Don't worry.

255
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
As long as I don't give up any hits to the outfield, it should be fine.

256
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,550
But honestly,
it's not looking good.

257
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,800
Kine is out, and
Yanagi is questionable.

258
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,020
It looks grim.

259
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,850
Griping won't do anything.

260
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,200
The two of us will have to make up for what we don't have.

261
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,840
I'm counting on you, Sir.

262
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,080
Me, too.

263
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,900
Homerun

264
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,550
We told you to get in front of the ball.

265
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,270
One more time !

266
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,430
Let's go !

267
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,230
Okay, let's switch.





268
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,390
Arikawa, go ahead !

269
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,210
Okay, let's go !

270
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,650
All right, one more !

271
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,930
Okay, there !

272
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,630
You can catch that one, too !

273
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,160
Yeah !

274
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,700
Okay, good job.

275
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,900
Okay now !

276
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,000
All right, next !

277
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,530
Well, you caught us.

278
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,380
You always practice here ?

279
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,400
Yeah.

280
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,500
Why didn't you tell us ?

281
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,940
Well, we thought you two might be tired for a lot of reasons.

282
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,710
You practice pitching after you coach us.

283
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,200
Besides, we're lousy.

284
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,410
We have to try to catch up to you as much as we can before the game.

285
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,720
We don't want to drag you down.

286
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,200
There's a chance that we might play baseball as an official club because you two joined us.

287
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,300
If we don't work 
hard now, when will we ?

288
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,350
Nice catch !

289
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,120
Next, fly ball !

290
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,000
Okay, this way !

291
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,120
I got it ! I got it ! I got it !

292
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,100
One more !

293
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,430
Man, I'm exhausted !

294
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,470
Tastes great !

295
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
I'm so looking forward to the game !

296
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,900
You seem to be having fun.

297
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,000
So your lineup is set ?

298
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,090
Can you afford to take it easy and read a magazine ?

299
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,660
Well, it's a piece of cake for us.

300
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,460
Oh.

301
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,320
All right.

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,970
Hmm.

303
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,540
Let's see.

304
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,190
Wow.

305
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,110
What did you do now ?

306
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,900
Defeat Meiwa Ichi !

307
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,900
"Defeat Meiwa Ichi !" ?

308
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,600
It sounds great.

309
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,890
Morons ! Why are you 
putting this up in my room ?

310
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,240
It's okay.

311
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,030
What's wrong ?

312
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,150
It's not okay !

The star I'm watching today...

330
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,400
...glistened yesterday.

331
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,020
In the town full of things that disappear...

332
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,150
...I thought to myself, wishfully:

333
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:06,130
Let's return to "two of us," let's return together...

334
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:14,250
...rather than losing our time to regret.

335
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,650
Happiness is not something...

336
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,480
...that someone does for me.

337
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:31,050
It means that I have someone I can embrace.

338
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,830
Hiro, I'll be waiting for you at the pool. You should take a break.

339
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,890
I'm tired of looking at you in a swimsuit by now.

340
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,650
Even if you say so, you
actually want to see it.

341
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,210
I have a place to go.

342
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,200
Where ?

343
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,690
A great curry restaurant.

344
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,390
Curry restaurant ? 
Who are you going with ?

345
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,630
Who knows ?

346
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,550
You're acting suspicious.

Are you having a refreshing workout ?

352
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,930
