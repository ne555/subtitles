1
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,020
Got it.

2
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,930
The dead body was gone?

3
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,990
Yes. Since then

4
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,900
There are other students saw it too.

5
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,090
They locked that place later on.

6
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,820
The forbidden biology room.

7
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,920
It was the old schoolhouse.

8
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,800
The seven mysteries.

9
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,060
Academy's Seven Mysteries
Murder Case File 1

10
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,030
The forbidden biology room?

11
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,830
You don't know?

12
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,960
The seven mysteries.

13
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,060
So...

14
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,060
There're 6 more murders
in the old schoolhouse?

15
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,990
Yes.

16
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,060
The second one was the chopped-off
hand in the printing room.

17
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,820
The third one was the bloody well.

18
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,030
Everybody knows about the six cases.

19
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,870
The seventh case remains a mystery.

20
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,790
They said if you
discover the seventh case,

21
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,060
you will be killed by
the after-school magician.

22
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
After-school magician?

23
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,020
Yeah. But nobody has seen him.

24
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,020
But rumor says that he's
at the old schoolhouse.

25
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,990
No way.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,930
Blood!

27
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,920
It's not. Look.

28
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,760
Ketchup?

29
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:11,770
I'm full!
Ketchup?

30
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm full!

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,930
Now that I know you're here
whenever you skip class.

32
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,960
Miyuki, the omelet was really delicious.

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,830
Thanks!

34
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,960
Huh? This is my...

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,970
Miyuki, remember to bring more tomorrow.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,960
My ankle!

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
I can't stand this.

38
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,830
Kindaichi Hajime, you're really
the trash of human beings.

39
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,860
I heard you got zero in math again.

40
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,960
It's hard to believe
you're the childhood

41
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,800
friend of Miyuki, the
best student in school.

42
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,890
Hajime-chan, here you go. Huh?

43
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,890
You already finished my homework
I asked for this morning?

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Please do your own homework. Huh?

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,800
If I continue doing this,
it won't help you at all.

46
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,920
So, please do it yourself.

47
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,690
You're stingy!

48
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,860
I remember you were a
lot nicer in kindergarten.

49
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,920
No means no.

50
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,690
Come on, please?

51
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,660
No!

52
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,890
Just as usual, Kindaichi.

53
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,730
Sakuragi-senpai?

54
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,860
Leave her alone.

55
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,700
This childhood friend of
yours is really an idiot.

56
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,860
Huh? An idiot?

57
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,860
I'm the only one who
understands your potential.

58
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,690
Excuse me...

59
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,720
Are you asking me?

60
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,790
I'm Sakuragi Ruiko, the chairman
of Mystery Research Club.

61
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,800
Leave this to me.

62
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,760
Are you going to do it for me, Senpai?

63
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,790
I need a favor from you as well.

64
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,890
Kindaichi.

65
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,870
I hope you can solve it.

66
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,660
The seven mysteries of Fudoh Academy.

67
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,670
The seven mysteries?

68
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,660
This is the first time I've
visited the Mystery Research Club.

69
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,760
Why are you here, Miyuki?

70
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,790
Who knows what you'd do, Hajime-chan!

71
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,700
I'm here to watch over you.

72
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,700
Excuse me.

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,730
Who are you?

74
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,690
I'm Kindaichi, Sakuragi
senpai told me to come here.

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,600
I thought Sakuragi has
brought a smart person here.

76
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,620
But you don't look anything
close to "detective smart" to me.

77
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,790
I thought so!

78
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,630
If I'm not mistaken, you're Makabe

79
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,860
Makoto-san who was on
the newspaper, right?

80
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,690
You've won a prize in the
mystery novel competition.

81
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,820
"The story of a dead body"

82
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,800
It's second on the best sellers list.

83
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,830
Makabe-kun is the
star in mass media now.

84
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,630
He's nicknamed the "Genius
Highschooler Novelist".

85
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,830
Someone's story didn't
pass even the preliminary.

86
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,630
No wonder Matoba-sensei
put up the poster there,

87
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,660
Onoue, how good would it
be if you have one too.

88
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,590
What are you doing there?

89
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,720
Nothing.

90
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,560
Go on.

91
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
How annoying.

92
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,560
Thank you.

94
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,790
Are those gloves used for operations?

95
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,760
Let me tell you, she's
unusually clean against germs.

96
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,730
Looks I'm at the wrong place...

97
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,720
This is troublesome.

98
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
What's the matter?

99
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,770
No one can read this.

100
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,660
The secret signs left
by Sakuragi-senpai.

101
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,620
She said, if we can't solve it,
we can't take part in the camp.

102
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,630
It's more like she did
this at her own pleasure.

103
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,530
This is just nonsense for sure.

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,760
This is the club camp schedule.

105
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,720
Look, this is calendar
for the Golden Week.

106
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,700
He's right.

107
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,460
The club camp is held on Golden Week.

108
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,660
You're amazing, Hajime-chan!

109
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,460
I never thought you can
solve such a difficult puzzle.

110
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,630
It's easy!

111
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,660
Good job, Kindaichi-kun.

112
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,690
That was just by luck.

113
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,430
Let me tell you, he's the grandson of

114
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,590
the famous detective, Kindaichi Kousuke.

115
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,650
Well,

116
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,690
He's a genius with an IQ of 180.

117
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,420
An IQ of 180? This fellow?!

118
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,430
Let's start the meeting now.

119
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,420
Today's agenda is the rumor in
Fudoh Academy's old schoolhouse,

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,560
the seven myteries. The seven mysteries?

121
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,620
You mean the one that once you know,

122
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,530
you'll be killed by the
after-school magician?

123
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,400
The after-school magician.

124
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,660
Sent a threat letter to the Principal.

125
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,460
The after-school magician
sent a threat letter?

126
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,560
Maybe it's because of the plan
to tear down the old schoolhouse.

127
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,690
It says if the old
schoolhouse is demolished,

128
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,630
the seventh mystery will occur.

129
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,630
If the old schoolhouse is
demolished... What will happen?

130
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,530
Why is there a threat letter?

131
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,620
I'm planning to use this as our them
in our upcoming school anniversary.

132
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,430
Our Mystery Research Club
will solve all the problems.

133
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,520
Of course, we'll uncover
the seventh mystery as well.

134
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,560
As a guidance teacher in
the Mystery Research Club,

135
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,430
I'd like to say something.

136
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,630
Yes, Matoba-sensei.

137
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,530
A long time ago,

138
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,590
there was a student trying
to investigate the mystery,

139
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,600
but he went missing till now.

140
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,530
If anything happens to you...

141
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,520
That doesn't sound
like words coming from

142
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,530
the physics teacher who pursue science.

143
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,430
But... If anything happens... You mean,

144
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,520
you'll be responsible for anything.

145
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,530
Aren't you?

146
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,500
No... I'm not...

147
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,430
Don't worry. We'll proceed with caution.

148
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,400
Is that clear, everyone?

149
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,520
Look.

150
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,430
It's the meeting minutes of
Mystery Research Club 10 years ago.

151
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,400
I found it in the cabinet.

152
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,590
There might be a key in these.

153
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,460
You're brave, Sakuragi-senpai.

154
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,530
I expect the most out of your
capability, Kindaichi-kun.

155
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,330
I'm sure you'll be able
to solve this mystery.

156
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm counting on you.

157
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,320
Just as I thought, the key
to solve the mystery is here.

158
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,460
It seems you're doing well
in solving the mystery.

159
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,260
Makabe-kun, you're still here?

160
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,320
You're cold just as usual.

161
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,490
I only like smart guys. Beside you.

162
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,330
I am the genius highschooler novelist.

163
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,420
I see.

164
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,420
If that was really your work,

165
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,420
it'd be wonderful.

166
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,370
Damn it, that woman!

167
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,300
Hi, as promised.

168
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
What if someone sees this?!

169
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,260
Don't you know if someone finds
out, that'd be the end of my fame?!

170
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,360
If my deduction is correct, it'd be...

171
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,220
Earthquake?

172
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,400
It finally stopped.

173
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,390
This building is really unstable.

174
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,300
This is...

175
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,270
That's right.

176
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,260
I got it, the seventh mystery...

177
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,290
Hajime-chan,

178
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,320
what do you want for
tomorrow's lunchbox?

179
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,230
Sakuragi-senpai...

180
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,360
why are you being so nice to me?

181
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,230
By any chance, am I being too popular?

182
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,220
Geez.

183
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,300
Phone call.

184
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,290
This is Kindaichi.

185
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,300
Sakuragi-senpai?

186
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,430
Kindaichi-kun, the last of seven
mysteries, I finally get it.

187
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,390
Really?

188
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,390
Please come here right now.

189
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,390
I'd like to show you
something interesting.

190
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,230
Everything's just like my deduction.

191
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,220
I never thought it'd be
such a scary secret...

192
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,220
He'll be shocked.

193
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,370
The last of the seven mysteries?

194
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,090
Will it be alright?

195
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,260
The rumor says you'll be killed by the

196
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,200
afterschool magician
if you find that out.

197
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,170
That's made-up.

198
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,320
This place looks creepy at night.

199
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,300
Is it?

200
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,160
Ah, this is the place.

201
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,190
It was the printing room back then.

202
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,260
It's the second of seven mysteries.

203
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,290
A male student chopped his hand off

204
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,300
with the cutting machine
in this printing room.

205
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,360
He died due to loss of blood.

206
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,090
After that, no matter
how hard everyone looked,

207
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,120
they couldn't find his severed hand.

208
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,190
Ever since,

209
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,330
the sound of the hand creeping
around was heard at night.

210
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:21,290
It was really scary!

211
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,220
What's wrong, Hajime-chan?

212
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,290
I heard something just now.

213
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,060
No... No way.

214
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,230
Behind you!

215
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,030
Just kidding.

216
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,230
You're too mean! Hajime-chan!

217
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,220
It's dark here.

218
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,130
You guys are here too?

219
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,030
You received the call as well?

220
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,160
You scared me.

221
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm sorry. I wanted to
switch on the lights,

222
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,170
but I saw you guys coming in, so...
I'm sorry. I wanted to
switch on the lights,

223
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,100
but I saw you guys coming in, so...

224
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,290
You are all here by
Sakuragi-senpai's call?

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,160
Mine was a male voice.

226
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,130
He said there will be a
death ritual at 10 o'clock.

227
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,130
Death ritual?

228
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,120
Hey, what are you guys doing here?!

229
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,130
You were called here by a phone call?

230
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,130
Hey, where's Sakuragi-senpai?

231
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,000
It's almost 10 o'clock now.

232
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,160
The time for a death ritual...

233
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,130
Don't say anything scary.

234
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,220
I'll go to have a look around.

235
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,200
You guys, go home.

236
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,100
Can I go with you?

237
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,100
Hajime-chan!

238
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,000
I have a weird premonition.

239
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,190
Everyone please wait here.

240
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,200
It's not here.

241
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,200
How about we go and have a
look at the old schoolhouse?

242
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,100
I feel like something might happen...

243
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,030
If you are worried,

244
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,020
you can see the old schoolhouse
from this new building.

245
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,060
If you look carefully,
the building is really old.

246
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,160
It'll be torn down soon.

247
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,000
There's light over there.

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,230
That's strange. How come there's
light from the forbidden biology room?

249
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,060
No one should be able to enter.

250
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,120
The forbidden biology room?

251
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,990
That's?!

252
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,960
That's... Sakuragi-senpai!

253
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,930
What's... that?!

254
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,990
Senpai!

255
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,960
It's the biology room for sure!

256
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,000
It's locked! Where's the key?!

257
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,960
It's without the key! That's why it's
called the forbidden biology room!

258
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:04,970
Damn it!
It's without the key! That's why it's
called the forbidden biology room!

259
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,060
Damn it!

260
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,930
What's going on?

261
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,060
Makabe-senpai!

262
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,160
Sakuragi-senpai is hanged inside!

263
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,960
It's the after-school magician!

264
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,960
The after-school magician?

265
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,900
What's going on?

266
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,020
Hajime-chan, what's wrong?

267
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,970
Saki, you should help us too!

268
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,900
No way, can't you see I'm busy?

269
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,030
It's gone.

270
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,860
The body and the candles are gone.

271
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,090
That's impossible. I
saw it with my own eyes.

272
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,100
Everything is locked.

273
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,060
There's no way he got
out through the windows.

274
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,070
That said...
There's no way he got
out through the windows.

275
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,090
That said...

276
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,860
The thing we saw just now...

277
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,920
What's wrong with everyone?

278
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Doesn't this resemble
the seven mysteries?

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,960
The disapperance of a hanged body
from the forbiden biology room...

280
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,860
Don't say stuff like that.

281
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,020
Hey, Hajime-chan, I finally have the
answer for what happened last night.

282
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,030
It must be a prank by Sakuragi-senpai.

283
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,830
Didn't she say she would show us
something interesting when she called?

284
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,920
It'd be great if that's the case.

285
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,960
Something happened over there.

286
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,990
Miyuki!

287
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,000
Miyuki! Miyuki!

288
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,060
This is bad! What's wrong?

289
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,060
Inside the forbidden biology room...

290
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,830
Return to your classroom now.

291
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,830
Do not come near.

292
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,820
Go back! The class will start soon!

293
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,890
Excuse me!

294
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,790
Hey... What are you doing?!

295
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,730
This can't be... Sakuragi-senpai...

296
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,720
Go back to your classroom.

297
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,720
Hey, what's wrong with you?

298
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,730
I expect the most out of your
capabilities, Kindaichi-kun.

299
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm sure you'll be able
to solve this mystery.

300
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,720
I'm counting on you.

301
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,830
The after-school magician.

302
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,820
Is this your doing?

303
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,920
I'll definitely solve this case.

304
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,730
In the name of the famous detective...

305
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,690
my grandfather!

306
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,800
Sakuragi-senpai is killed.

307
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,920
The death ritual we saw
that night was not a dream.

308
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,760
The clues left by
senpai before she died,

309
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,860
must have something to do
with the after-school magician.

310
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,800
The shadow that attacked from behind.

311
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,700
And the second murder case.

312
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,630
Huh? Miyuki is missing?!

313
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,830
Miyuki, where are you?!

314
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,730
Please watch again next episode.

315
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,820
Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo.

316
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,860
Academy's Seven Mysteries
Murder Case File 2

317
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,630
Can you solve the mystery?

318
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,690
The killer is among them!
