Starting up once more

Let's run towards tomorrow

I want you by my side

To make up what I'm missing

I'm afraid to be alone

I cannot show that weakness

Being together is the energy we need

To go to the future

Changing, soaring

Even if the sky is distant

I want to tell you that this passion

Gives me the strength to never give in

I won't hesitate anymore

I'm starting up so I can be myself

Good morning, sir.

'Morning.

Chief, regarding the report I submitted...

The cherry blossoms have already begun to fall.

This year's cherry blossom party was a disaster.

It's like that every year.

That's true, but I want to get a taste
of the flower-viewing mood.

It's already been a year since
you joined us, Saori.

Yes!

You've gotten completely accustomed
to the Traffic Section.

Not at all... I have a long way to go.

I want to become like all of you.

I'm trying especially hard to fill in for Natsumi.

We're counting on you.

Is Natsumi doing okay?

Kobayakawa
Is Natsumi doing okay?

Kobayakawa
Yeah...

Tsujimoto
Yeah...

Tsujimoto

Tsujimoto
I wonder how she's doing.

What's this?!

Miyuki, is something the matter?

What could that stench be?!
It smells like rotting garbage!

Tsujimoto
What could that stench be?!
It smells like rotting garbage!

Tsujimoto
What could possibly be in there?

What could possibly be in there?

It's no good! I can't go near it!

Here goes.

What was that?!

What's wrong, Kobayakawa?!

Hey, are you all right?

Crossing the Bridge to Tomorrow

Rice balls, sandwiches, sweets and juices...

Of course they're going to be rotten and moldy.

Good grief! That was a horrible parting gift!

Was she planning on going into hibernation?

I don't think I can eat anything for a while...

It's something Tsujimoto would do.

Chief! This isn't funny!

We had to clean it up. Put yourself in our place!

Sorry.

It's as if Natsumi is still with us.

What?

You always knew when she was here.

She's not going to be easy to forget.

You make it sound as if being loud
was her only good point.

No!

She was that great a person!

She had her flaws,

but she made up for them with an
overabundance of enthusiasm and ability!

That is what we should applaud!

Should we be lavishing so much praise on her?

We should!

But seriously, you haven't heard from her at all?

No. She was never good at keeping in touch.

I wish I could see her sometime
and talk about things.

The next time you hear from her,
please let me know.

Sure.

Shall we get going?

Okay!

It won't be long...

We'll soon be able to cross that bridge.

Yes.

So when it's finished, pack the Motocompo
in the Today and cross that bridge for me.

Violations don't decrease no matter what we do.

How unusual. Do I sense negativity?

No! This is our job!

If we can make people's lives even a bit
safer and more comfortable,

then our efforts will be rewarded!

Saori, you've already become
a full-fledged police officer.

Do you really think so? Full-fledged, huh?!

Wh-what's this?!

Saori!

You're lenient! You're too lenient!

With that kind of enforcement, no traffic
violators will ever be compelled to repent!

That's...

Strike Man, the crusader for Love, Justice
and Truth, has arrived!

He's back...

Just a minute! What do you think you're doing?!

Violators don't need repentance!

They need due punishment!

This is what I call social reform!

That's nothing but an excuse.

My balls of Love and Justice will do the job
that you hapless officers will not!

Take that! And that! And that!

What's he doing?! Stop it!

Well if it isn't Recycling Woman!

It appears you continue to live a sloppy life
devoid of repentance or contrition!

What?!

Natsu

Saori...

Don't stop me! I can't back down
from this challenge!

You've got the wrong hand on top.

How interesting!

So you want to become
Homerun Woman 2, do you?

Then hit my Strike Ball
of Love, Justice, and Truth!

Here it comes!

Bring it on!

Saori...

If you want to be called full-fledged,
hit my ball first!

This is so vexing!

Why can't I hit it?

Is it because I lack a sense of Justice?!

I don't think Justice has much to do with it.

And besides, Natsumi was the only one
who could hit that.

Forgive me, Natsumi Senpai!

EACH SWING WITH STRIKE DOWN
ALL MY MIGHT STRIKE MAN!

EACH SWING WITH STRIKE DOWN
ALL MY MIGHT STRIKE MAN!
...98, 99, 100!

...98, 99, 100!

You'll hurt yourself if you overdo it.

No! I swear on Natsumi Senpai's bat
that I will hit his pitch!

Miyuki! Big news!

What is it?

Assistant Inspector Kinoshita's here.

Assistant Inspector Kinoshita?

Now that Bokutou Ohashi Bridge is completed,

there will be festivities next week
to commemorate its opening.

We need the Traffic Section to handle
preparations and security for the event.

They're expecting more congestion
than previously anticipated.

We'll need the Traffic Section
to work even harder.

Work at the festivities?

You're not making us do the
Color Guard again, are you?!

Not that!

Don't worry. There'll be no Color Guard this time.

Yuka Hasumi will be the special guest
at the festivities.

Yuka Hasumi?!

She's coming again?!

I'm going to get her autograph this time!

There's going to be quite a crowd.

I'll be looking forward to your
cooperation and efforts.

Yes, ma'am!

Do a good job.

We will!

Excuse me, Assistant Inspector Kinoshita.

Yes?

How is Natsumi, I mean Officer Tsujimoto?

The same. She's highly regarded.

I see...

But I'm told she might be fired
for being too unruly...

Oh no! Is that true?

Are you that concerned about her?

She's doing better than we expected.

She hasn't complained even once
about the intense training.

Natsumi hates to lose.

So do you.

Yes. I can't lose to Natsumi.

Working here...

Yes!

...you may be separated from her,
but you're still a fine partner.

Yes!

Good luck.

Thank you very much!

I'm told Natsumi's doing well.

Good to hear it.

It's lovely...

Yes...

I wonder if Natsumi's looking at this, too.

You miss her?

I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

We've been together all this time.

I know...

But you'll stay with me, won't you, Nakajima?

Of course I will...

I mean... I want to be with you...

But if you don't want me to...

No, even if you don't,
I want to be with you, Kobayakawa.

Thank you.

It looks like traffic will change drastically
once the bridge is completed.

I think we should change our patrol routes.

But it should reduce the number of drivers
who use shortcuts.

Yes, just as you predicted, Kobayakawa.
I have to hand it you.

I've had enough of this!

You're creating a nuisance!

We can't move from here!

Is something the matter?

Police officer!

These people put up a tent here.

They're obstructing the sidewalk
and making a mess! It's terrible!

Are you camping here?

We're trying to be first in line to cross the bridge.

That's why we staked out this spot.

You're those guys who are obsessed
with being first for everything.

This is a public sidewalk.
You'll need to leave immediately.

But...

Out of my way!

I can get to the sales faster this way!

Here she comes...

The Moped Mama!

This bridge isn't open yet. You can't go across!

That's right! We're going to be
the first ones across!

Get in line!

Keep quiet! You're in my way!

I'm not letting you through!

We won't let you!

Shouldn't we stop them?

Could you stop them, Nakajima?

What?!

I'm counting on you.

But...

Let go of me! The sale's going to end!

I'm not letting you go!

You three, let me handle this. Let go of her.

Senpai?!

Coming through!

Nakajima Senpai!

Let me go! Out of my way!

Help me!

Good grief.

She always shows up when we're busiest.
What a nuisance!

I thought that it was impressive that
you held on until the very end.

Nakajima Senpai, I'm terribly sorry.

It's nothing to worry about.

She ended up going to a different sale.

I need some help here.

Yes, sir.

These are the decorations and props
for the bridge-opening festivities.

We'll be keeping them here
until the day of the event.

Which means...

Carry these inside.
Which means...

Carry these inside.

I thought so...

Also, the kusudama is a special one,
so handle it with care.

Oh, and one last thing...

Good grief... Chief shouldn't
have accepted this job!

He had no choice. They didn't have
enough decorations.

This is vital to the public's happiness.

Let's do our best!

Here, this is for the kusudama.

Thanks! I'll take care of the kusudama!

Nakajima...

Huh?

You do that part like this.
The base goes this way.

Like this?

Yes. You're good at it!

Really?

Nakajima, are you acting clumsily
so that you can get Miyuki's attention?

No way!

It's not like that!

That's right. Nakajima really is clumsy. Right?

Well...

You two seem to be getting along well...

Did Chief go home already?

I don't know... He hasn't come back.

Don't you think that leaving this sort of work
to the women is a form of sex discrimination?

Gulp!

That's not true. Chief has a lot to keep him busy.

Besides, Chief seems even
clumsier than Nakajima.

I guess we can just ignore him!

I'll go make us some tea.

Thanks!

Huh? What are these?

You seem happy, Yoriko.

The decorations we worked so hard to make
are going to be center stage!

That's not a bad feeling.

Chief! What do you think?
Pretty good, huh?

Wonderful... I couldn't have
made them, anyway...

Did something happen to Chief?

He's probably nervous since this is a big event.

Here she comes!

It's Yuka Hasumi!

How do you do?

That completes the preparations.
Now all we have to do is...

What is it, Aoi?

I get the feeling we forgot something...
like something's missing...

Bokutou Ohashi
Bridge Opening Celebration
I get the feeling we forgot something...
like something's missing...

Bokutou Ohashi
Bridge Opening Celebration
No!

I wish I could see the festivities, too.

Sorry, but work comes first.

Yes, you're right.

Hi! We came to see!

Hi.

Hi, everyone.

There are lots of people today,
it's not safe to be by yourselves.

Don't worry! Adults came with us!

We came with Daddy and the others.

Miyuki!

Hey, this is quite a crowd.

Good afternoon.

Be careful not to get lost.

Not us!

We're not babies!

Yuuta and Shou always run off on their own.

Yeah.

We'd better hurry up or
we won't find a good spot.

Okay, let's go. We'll see you later, Miyuki.

Okay.

Look at all these people!
It's not going to be easy.

That's right. Please keep an eye on the children.

Kobayakawa!

Ken!

Dad, you're here, too?

We came to watch you do your job.

Well, good luck.

Thank you.

We have an emergency!
The kusudama isn't here!

The kusudama?

Huh?

Oh no!

What?!

I'm sorry! I forgot the all-important kusudama!

Save the regrets for later.

We have less than an hour
before the festivities start.

Right!

Tokuno?!

The Traffic Section's gone,
so I'm watching the office.

Thank you for your help.
We came back for something we forgot.

Here it is! Thank goodness!

Saori, hurry!

Right!

Good grief. Never a dull moment
at the Traffic Section.

Do you think we'll make it in time?

By the skin of our teeth.

A traffic jam? All the way here?

Oh no!

Traffic Section.

Tokuno? Did Miyuki get there yet?

A few minutes ago.

The streets headed in this direction
are backed up solid!

That's not good.

They might not make it back in time.

Don't worry.

You've always found some way to
come through no matter what.

Huh? Tokuno?

That's how it is here at Traffic Section, right?

We're not going to make it!
I'll carry it there myself!

Wait! There has to be a way.

But...

Don't give up until the very end!

If we detour around this street...

I might be able to...

But there are more cars than normal.

A motorcycle! That's it... I'll call Nakajima.

Working hard, Traffic Section?

Need help?

Natsumi?!

Natsumi Senpai?!

They said the bridge was completed,
so I wanted to cross it.

I insisted on a day off and
went to the Traffic Section.

Then Detective Tokuno said you had
some sort of emergency,

so I grabbed this and came after you.

You should've called!

That's right! We were all worried about you!

Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to keep it
a secret or anything.

Natsumi, are you wearing your uniform?

Yeah, don't know why, but there was
a clean one in my locker.

Thought I'd wear it for old times' sake.
Was that wrong of me?

That's the one we washed
because it was growing mold...

What?

What's so funny?!

It's nothing! We don't have much time.

Natsumi!

Did I make it in time?

This street.

I know. The one we always covered.

Traffic is heavy today, so be careful.

Okay!

Natsumi!

I'm counting on you.

Ten-four!

Natsumi Senpai will come through for sure!

Yes, she will!

Saori, get the latest information
from Traffic Control.

Right!

Natsumi Senpai!

Saori?

A change in your route.
Turn left at the second corner.

Okay! Guide me!

Chief, how are the preparations coming?

They're proceeding on schedule. Don't worry.

Please see to it.

If anything goes wrong,
it'll be the Traffic Section's fault...

No, my fault.

They're taking so long!

Hey! Isn't it here yet?

No...

Nakajima, contact Kobayakawa!

Huh?

Now!
Huh?

Now!

Yes, sir!

Is there something wrong?

Nothing's wrong!

Huh?

Hi.

Geez! I'm so close!

Okay, here goes!

Please make three lines.

Yo! Working hard?

Who was that?

What did you just say? Tsujimoto?!

Excuse me! Coming through!
What did you just say? Tsujimoto?!

Excuse me! Coming through!

Natsumi?

She's back?!

Excuse me!

Please let me through!

Natsumi!

What're you doing?

Good to see you again!

Aunty Natsumi!

Hey! How're you all doing?

It's Natsumi!

I'll come by later!

Natsumi!

Excuse me! Please let me through!

Hi, Officer!

Good afternoon!

What? Natsumi?!

What? Tsujimoto?!

Tsujimoto is back?

I'll drop by some time!

You're heavy!

Over here!

Shoji!

Catch!

What?!

Strike Man, the crusader for Love, Justice,
Truth and Firsts, has arrived!

What an entrance! I can't beat that.

I'll be the one who crosses this bridge first!

Therefore, this kusudama is mine!

Hey you! Give back the kusudama!

Natsumi!

He's always obsessed with being first!

Natsumi Senpai! Use this!

Natsu
Natsumi Senpai! Use this!

Stop it!

Stop it!

I challenge you, Strike Man!

Oh! If it isn't Homerun Woman!

You haven't learned your lesson and
want to challenge me again?

Fine!

I will prove to you there is a pitch in this world
that cannot be hit!

You're on.

You did it!

I blew it...

We'll meet again, Homerun Woman!

Will he be all right?

He's fine! He's not the type
to let this get him down.

But next time...

Right! Next time, I'll hit a homerun for sure!

He's all yours.

You can count on me!

So today commemorates the birth
of Homerun Woman 2?

Sounds good to me.

All right, let the real festivities begin!

Members of Bokutou Police Station
Traffic Section, lead the way!

Tsujimoto, let's put you two back together.

Huh?

Natsumi, didn't you say you wanted
to cross the bridge?

But I...

Don't be modest.

It's not like you!

Go ahead.

Natsumi...

Okay!

Nakajima invited Miyuki on a trip to a hot spring!

So Nakajima finally decided to make his move!

But do you really think those two
will make any progress?

We'll have to see their future through at all costs.

Chief!

Then are we all going to the hot spring?

Next time on "You're Under Arrest."

Nakajima! Be a man!
