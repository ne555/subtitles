I'm late! I'm late!

13
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,264
Miyuki!

14
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:56,534
'Morning!

15
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,044
Good morning.

16
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:01,014
Yoriko, how're those plans going?

17
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:03,924
Trust me! I've got everything covered!

18
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,754
Natsumi Senpai is sure going to be surprised!

19
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:10,294
Saori, do you have today's activities planned?

20
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:12,194
Not yet...

21
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:14,064
That's Tsujimoto for you...

22
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,764
Tardy even on her last day at work.

23
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:18,234
No, she'll be coming soon.

24
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,074
Shall we get started, then?

25
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,674
Good morning!

26
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:24,804
I did it!

27
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:27,974
I finally broke my string of continuous tardies!

28
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,514
You know your partner well.

29
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:30,414
Oh yes.

30
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,044
Huh?

31
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:31,444
Farewell Party for
Officer Natsumi Tsujimoto!!
Huh?

32
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,554
Farewell Party for
Officer Natsumi Tsujimoto!!

33
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:38,514
Separate Ways

34
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:45,094
You know, I think I understand why you take
such good care of the Today.

35
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:47,924
Why are you suddenly getting so sentimental?

36
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,534
It doesn't match me, huh?

37
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:51,404
Shall we get going, then?

38
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,194
Right!

39
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:15,514
As usual, there're a lot of parking violations here.

40
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,824
Natsumi, you seem quite gung-ho today.

41
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,194
Really?

42
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,464
Did I just see a grin on your face?

43
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,834
Not at all.

44
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,634
Don't try to hide it.

45
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:29,964
You show your feelings more than
you think you do.

46
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:33,204
Especially when you're thinking about
a certain someone.

47
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:34,274
Honestly...

48
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:35,614
He's turning into a one-way street!

49
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:36,274
Miyuki!

50
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:36,544
Right!
Miyuki!

51
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:36,914
Right!

52
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:39,984
You in the red van! Pull over immediately!

53
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:41,834
Crap!

54
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:43,644
Pull over!

55
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:46,384
He wants to play hardball!

56
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,054
He'll become a hazard if we don't move quickly!

57
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:49,054
You don't need to tell me.

58
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,084
Nitro on!

59
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:10,184
Driving 40 kph over the speed limit,

60
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,214
running a red light,

61
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:12,884
going the wrong way on a one-way street...

62
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,854
...and defying an order to pull over.

63
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,714
Trying to run cost you.

64
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,914
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:23,664
They're at it!

66
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:24,824
What?
They're at it!

67
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:27,164
You parked, even though you knew
it was a no-parking zone.

68
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:31,004
Rules are of benefit only when
each and every person obeys them.


69
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,794
Remember that!

70
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:38,204
That's odd... this area isn't
usually this congested.

71
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:39,904
An accident, maybe?

72
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,344
What's this?!

73
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:45,014
Sorry! Please stop!

74
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,414
The light is red! What were you doing?

75
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,184
My map...

76
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,574
This?

77
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,624
Here you go, Granny.

78
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:57,064
Thank you very much.

79
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,864
Where are you headed?

80
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,454
A place called Ryogoku...

81
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,264
Thank you so much.

82
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,234
I never expected you to do all this.

83
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:11,944
Don't mention it! This is part of our job.

84
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,544
Please pay more attention to red lights, though.

85
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,374
I will.

86
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,614
Whoa!

87
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:24,154
Your grandson lives in a huge place!

88
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:25,844
Quite impressive...

89
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,584
Excuse me!

90
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,794
Thank you for coming all this way.

91
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:33,294
Hey! Tachikawa, are you there?

92
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:34,854
Coming!

93
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,264
A sumo wrestler...

94
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:40,374
Huge!

95
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,034
You called, Stable Master?

96
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,874
Your grandmother's here.

97
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:45,504
Taro! Is that you, Taro?!

98
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:47,564
Is that you, Granny?

99
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,344
You came out here to see me?

100
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:50,344
Umm...

101
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:50,884
Yes?

102
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,244
You're welcome to come inside for some tea.

103
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:55,214
No thank you, we're still on duty.

104
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:59,224
I'd prefer chanko nabe over tea.


105
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,254
Natsumi!

106
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:02,324
Thank you very much.

107
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:03,514
Thank you!

108
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:06,824
Chanko nabe...

109
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,994
You could become one of them, eating that.


110
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,294
Cut it out.

111
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,274
It's cold and delicious!

112
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,704
Ramune at summer's end... How cool is that?

113
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,914
I hear you're going somewhere?

114
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,414
Well, yes...

115
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:27,184
I heard. It's that FBI place, right?

116
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:29,814
No, not quite.

117
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:34,124
I don't know much about it, but good luck.

118
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,664
How about another one?

119
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,824
Think of it as my going-away present.

120
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:40,894
Huh?

121
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:41,834
But...

122
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,564
Don't mention it.

123
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,294
When you come back, drop by again.

124
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:47,834
Thank you!

125
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:51,904
Hmm...

126
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:52,274
What is it?
Hmm...

127
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:53,074
What is it?

128
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,614
Nothing...

129
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,814
Hey, why don't we check on that shortcut?

130
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:57,834
Good idea.

131
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:02,114
Thank you for your cooperation!

132
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:07,854
It's almost surprising how many
fewer cars pass through.

133
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:10,924
Nowadays, there aren't many cars
even when you're not here on duty.

134
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,964
It's been a great help.

135
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,164
It looks like we're fine here, as well.

136
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:16,334
May I have a word with you, officers?

137
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:17,204
Yes, ma'am?!

138
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,734
We have something to tell you.

139
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:19,504
Yes?

140
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:22,024
Some people aren't obeying
the rules for trash days.

141
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:27,034
And at night, the motorcycles are so annoying...
especially on weekends.

142
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:28,574
An underwear thief?

143
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,114
Considering how lovely you are, I can see why...

144
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,954
But you see... it's Grandma's
that they're stealing.

145
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,614
Huh?!

146
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:34,984
What am I to do?
Huh?!

147
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:35,574
What am I to do?

148
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:43,864
Don't you get the feeling we're more like
community troubleshooters than traffic officers?

149
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,564
It's easy to ask you for help, Natsumi.

150
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:47,294
You think so?

151
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:48,064
Yes.

152
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:53,634
Does that mean the community's
accepted me as a full-fledged officer?

153
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:55,504
Could be...

154
00:07:55,504 --> 00:08:02,314
Is it because of my continuous hard work
to protect the daily lives of others?

155
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,864
I've got good character.

156
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:06,544
What?

157
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:08,014
Why're you laughing?!

158
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:12,884
They probably just remember you
because you're always making such a scene.

159
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:13,724
Huh?

160
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:14,984
That's harsh!

161
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,294
We're back!

162
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:21,994
Thank you for your hard work, Senpai!
How was your patrol?

163
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:24,164
What? Is something the matter, Saori?

164
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:26,104
Nothing out of the ordinary, I'd say.

165
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:30,434
Today is a very special day for the two of you!

166
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,244
Okay, everybody!

167
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:35,414
Shall we head out for Officer
Natsumi Tsujimoto's farewell party?!

168
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,514
All right!

169
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,014
Huh? Just a minute...

170
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:41,254
We have paperwork to do...

171
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,184
I'll help you!

172
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:44,324
We can handle it.

173
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,084
No!

174
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:48,494
We want you there as soon as possible!
So I'll help!

175
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,094
Okay then, we're going on ahead.

176
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,764
Don't take long.

177
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:55,394
All right, if you're not on duty, let's get going!

178
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:56,924
Yes, sir!

179
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,474
Well, we'll be going...

180
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,634
Come quickly.

181
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:04,674
Ten-four!

182
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:05,574
Good work!

183
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:09,544
Senpai, this doesn't look like
Traffic Section work...

184
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:10,714
It probably isn't.

185
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,584
But these people do have a problem.

186
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:17,574
I'd like to help them as much as possible.

187
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:20,754
I'll keep that in mind.

188
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,954
Miyuki... Are you done?

189
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:26,024
Yes. I'll print it tomorrow.

190
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,934
I'm done here, too! Shall we get going?

191
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:32,704
C'mon! We're going to have fun!

192
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,434
We'll let loose tonight!

193
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,434
Yes!

194
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:40,244
Bokutou Police Station Traffic Section.

195
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:40,944
Well then...

196
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:41,474
Yes...
Well then...

197
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:41,844
Yes...
Chief will scold us if we're late! Let's go!

198
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:43,844
Chief will scold us if we're late! Let's go!

199
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:44,714
Yes!

200
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,884
What?! What is the location?

201
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:49,074
Hibari No. 2

202
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:52,354
What? Tsujimoto and Kobayakawa
are going to be late?

203
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:53,444
Huh?

204
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:55,794
Calm down, Saga.

205
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:58,364
Sorry, but I want you to assist them, Saga.

206
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,364
What?!

207
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:00,734
Take care of it.

208
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,784
Chief? Chief?!

209
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:10,704
They say it won't take long, so shall we begin?

210
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:11,744
Okay!

211
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,604
Let's start with a toast.

212
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:17,374
Knowing them, they'll be here in no time.

213
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,304
Yes, it's so typical of Natsumi.

214
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,354
A toast to Natsumi! Cheers.

215
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:25,114
Cheers.

216
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:37,894
Excuse us! Please let us through!

217
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:39,534
We're from Bokutou Police Station.

218
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,634
We didn't know what else to do.

219
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:46,134
We think a dog chased it up there,
but now it can't come down.

220
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,314
Oh dear... What'll we do?

221
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:52,744
Cats are your specialty, Natsumi.

222
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:53,514
You think?

223
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,984
When I look back, Tsujimoto was a fine officer!

224
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:00,994
That's right!

225
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,294
It is our duty to carry on Natsumi's work...

226
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,634
Umm... She isn't dead, you know...

227
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,464
Aoi! You have a problem with that?!

228
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:12,364
No, it's not that...

229
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:14,934
What time is your train?

230
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:16,334
I'm still fine.

231
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:20,044
It'll be lonely without Tsujimoto.

232
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:20,874
Yes.

233
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,534
For Kobayakawa, too.

234
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:24,934
But we won't have to worry about that, will we?

235
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,784
Excuse me!

236
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:33,284
Senpai! What's going on?

237
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:36,394
Saori, it's dangerous here, so stand back.

238
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,324
Where's Natsumi Senpai?

239
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:40,224
Senpai?!

240
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:46,194
You're all right now. I came to help you down.

241
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,304
Well, I'd better get going.

242
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,274
I see...

243
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:54,774
You're leaving?! You're leaving
before Natsumi even comes?!

244
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:56,114
I have a train to catch...

245
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:59,214
What's more important?
Your train or your girlfriend?!

246
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:01,714
Yoriko, that's enough.

247
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:05,744
Hey, Nakajima!
Make up your mind about Miyuki!

248
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:07,554
Hey, Chief!

249
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:09,924
You're not firm enough.

250
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:13,124
That's why we've got so many
wishy-washy guys!

251
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,624
I'm very sorry about that...

252
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:18,564
As long as you know!

253
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,204
Yoriko, you need to rest.

254
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:25,074
Hey, Aoi! You're the wishy-washiest of them all!

255
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:27,474
Are you a man or a woman?!
Make up your mind!

256
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:31,114
I have the body of a man,
but I'm a woman at heart.

257
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,684
There you go again!

258
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,984
Okay, let's find out!

259
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:39,284
Yoriko!

260
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:42,824
How unfortunate... You came all this way here.

261
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:45,324
No, Natsumi's being herself until the very end.

262
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:46,594
True...

263
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:47,324
See you.

264
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,094
Okay. Be careful.

265
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:53,464
He says that so casually...

266
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:04,084
Forgive me. But it's your fault, Yoriko,
for unbuttoning me...

267
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,474
I give up.
Forgive me. But it's your fault, Yoriko,
for unbuttoning me...

268
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:08,284
I think it got away from her.

269
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:14,614
This is scary, even for me...

270
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:19,254
Be a good little kitty and stay right there...

271
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:22,994
You won't run away anymore, right?

272
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:25,194
Come on...

273
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:30,874
Good kitty. You're safe now.

274
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:34,914
Oh no!

275
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,204
Natsumi Senpai!

276
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,344
Natsumi!

277
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,484
Natsumi!

278
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,654
Natsumi!

279
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:50,924
Senpai!

280
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:52,594
No way...

281
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:55,024
Natsumi...

282
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:00,694
Natsumi!

283
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,634
Up here!

284
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:04,094
Thank goodness.

285
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,184
Now then, what do we do with this little guy?

286
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,444
We can't take him to the Reverend...

287
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:15,554
Why don't we keep him at our Traffic Section?


288
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,254
I know! I know just the place.

289
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:20,274
They'll love him.

290
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,724
Sorry to keep you all waiting!

291
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:25,294
What the?!

292
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:26,524
Oh, Natsumi!

293
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:29,594
We were waiting for you. You're awfully late.

294
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:30,834
What is this?!

295
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,204
Everyone's already smashed...

296
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,604
Without today's guest of honor?!

297
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:38,574
Oh, Tsujimoto... are you drinking?

298
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:39,704
Jeez!

299
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,044
Tsujimoto.

300
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:43,744
You're late. You missed out...

301
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:47,404
"Missed out" nothing! It looks like
the party's already over!

302
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:51,424
I meant Senior Officer Tokairin.
He left a minute ago.

303
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,284
What?

304
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:55,584
We wanted to surprise you,
so we had him come over.

305
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:59,064
I see... we didn't make it in time.

306
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,584
Natsumi Senpai...

307
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:07,294
Darn...

308
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:11,474
Natsumi...

309
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:12,834
Senpai...

310
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:19,014
Because of that kitten,
all the food and drink is gone.

311
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:20,244
Too bad!

312
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:24,154
Before he left, the Senior Officer said
you acted like yourself until the very end.

313
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,184
Now then...

314
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:30,454
The guest of honor is here,
so the real party is about to begin!

315
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:32,024
Let's party!

316
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:32,864
Right!

317
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:35,764
I'm not letting you end the party like this!

318
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,194
We wouldn't think of it!

319
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:40,004
Great! Tonight's on Nakajima!

320
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,474
What?! Give me a break!

321
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,134
Oh, come on, don't be so modest!

322
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:45,194
Yoriko, are you all right?

323
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:50,014
Hey, Yoriko! It isn't your bedtime yet!

324
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,114
The drinking's just started!

325
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:57,314
Oh, it's you, Natsumi... What're you doing here?

326
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:58,024
What?!

327
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,614
Tonight is Natsumi's farewell party.

328
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:03,624
Fine!

329
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:08,624
I, Yoriko Nikaido, will liven up this party
by taking it all off!

330
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:10,564
Here I go!

331
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,604
You mustn't, Yoriko!

332
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:16,804
Then Aoi, you strip in my place!

333
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:18,904
Do it! Do it!

334
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:21,344
Yoriko! All the way!

335
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:26,114
Stop it! This is a special day!

336
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,314
Now, now...

337
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,484
Tonight, anything goes, Saga.

338
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:33,324
Chief! That is clearly sexual harassment!

339
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:34,954
Are you turning a blind eye to that?!

340
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,454
I wasn't...

341
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,994
Then why aren't you stopping Nikaido Senpai?!

342
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:42,134
Tsujimoto, do your best at your new post.

343
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,734
I will! Thank you!

344
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,064
To Natsumi.

345
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:46,364
Cheers!

346
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:48,704
Okay, I'm stripping, too!

347
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:50,734
I was waiting for that!

348
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,864
Chief! What're you doing?!

349
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,354
In the end, I never made it...

350
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,594
It's too bad we missed the Senior Officer.

351
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,384
No, I was talking about the bridge.

352
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:12,724
What?

353
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:16,524
I wanted to cross it at least once.

354
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,804
I know how you feel...

355
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,034
Now, let's go home and get a good night's sleep!

356
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:23,804
Aren't you leaving today?

357
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:26,644
Oh, that's right! Can't be tardy on my first day!


358
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:29,404
Good grief. I worry about your future.

359
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:33,244
I'm gonna do this! I feel fired up!

360
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:35,554
Miyuki! I'll race you back home!

361
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,184
What? Just a minute.

362
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:36,854
Go!
What? Just a minute.

363
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:36,884
What? Just a minute.

364
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,354
Wait, Natsumi.

365
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:42,144
Natsumi?

366
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,094
I feel sick...

367
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:46,894
Miyuki, call a taxi...

368
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:51,364
Pull yourself together!

369
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:53,164
I might not make it...

370
00:17:58,104 --> 00:17:59,374
'Morning.

371
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:00,704
Good morning!

372
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,914
That so? Not even a call?

373
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:05,714
It's already been a while since she's gone there.

374
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:08,614
She might not have had the time.

375
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:11,554
This is Tsujimoto we're talking about.
She'll be fine.

376
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:12,424
Oh!

377
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,924
What is it, Saori?

378
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,154
This!

379
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,424
An e-mail!

380
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:17,724
E-mail?

381
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:23,294
"Dear Bokutou Police Station Traffic Section,
I presume all is well since we last met."


382
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:29,734
I, Natsumi Tsujimoto, am training hard
day and night with the Special Assault Team.

383
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,344
This place is every bit
as tough as people say it is.

384
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:36,144
By the end of day, even I am totally exhausted.

385
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:37,944
But the food here is the best!

386
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:40,714
Both in terms of quality and quantity,
I have no complaints!

387
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:44,214
I hope this e-mail at least gives you
an idea of how I feel.

388
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:49,054
From faraway skies,
I pray for everyone's success.

389
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:51,444
"Natsumi Tsujimoto."

390
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:54,264
What an odd e-mail...

391
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:58,254
That's the same old Tsujimoto!

392
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:03,004
Yes, it's so typical of Natsumi.

393
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,374
She was born for that job, don't you think?

394
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:06,644
Perhaps.

395
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,844
Totally.

396
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:11,144
Tsujimoto's doing her best.

397
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:13,384
I'm counting on all of you to do the same.

398
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,344
Yes, sir!

399
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:15,744
Patrol time!

Dear Miyuki...
One last thing's been bothering me...
I really wanted to cross the
Bokutou Ohashi Bridge.

Dear Miyuki...
One last thing's been bothering me...
It's my one and only regret.

405
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:27,894
It's my one and only regret.

406
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:34,164
So when it's finished, pack the Motocompo
in the Today and cross that bridge for me.

407
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,334
I'll be counting on you!

408
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:35,804
See you again!
To Miyuki Kobayakawa.
From Natsumi
I'll be counting on you!

409
00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:38,294
See you again!
To Miyuki Kobayakawa.
From Natsumi

410
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:48,654
Shall we get going, Saori?!

411
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,314
Yes! I'm counting on you!

412
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:05,134
Daddy! Aunty Miyuki is here!

413
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:06,994
Aunty!

414
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,934
Hi, Megumi.

415
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:09,804
Have you been well?

416
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:10,604
Yes!

417
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:11,604
Miyuki!

418
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,544
Look how big he's grown!

419
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,474
He's so cute!

420
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:19,344
He sure is. It's because you all
take good care of him.

421
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,584
He's very frisky, so we're very careful
he doesn't run away.

422
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,624
Is that so?

423
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,584
Miyuki, everyone at school is grateful.

424
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:32,324
There're much fewer cars on the streets around
school, so it's a lot safer to play.

425
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,964
Yeah. We're not afraid anymore.

426
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:38,934
You and your friends did that, right? Thank you!

427
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:40,094
Thank you!

428
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:42,604
Thank Natsumi for us, too.

429
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,304
I will. Thanks.

430
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:46,704
Bye-bye!

431
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,934
Come again!

432
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:54,584
Working in the community,
we get to meet all sorts of people.

433
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,924
It's stimulating and motivating!

434
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,974
Yes, it is...

435
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:07,964
Excuse me...

436
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:10,964
You're that policewoman
from the other day, aren't you?

437
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:12,664
Yes, I am.

438
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:17,504
There are fewer motorcycles at night nowadays,
so we've been able to get a good night's sleep.

439
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:22,044
You petitioned the Ward Office,
didn't you? Thank you.

440
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:25,544
No need to thank me. I'm very happy for you.

441
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:28,284
If you need anything else, don't hesitate to ask.

442
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:29,854
Yes, we will.

443
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:31,144
Bye.

444
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:34,184
Thank you!

445
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:39,954
Kobayakawa.

446
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,724
I'm glad...

447
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:49,264
Huh?

448
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:53,274
I'm glad I became a police officer.


449
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:57,214
I have all of you at the Traffic Section,
the people in the community,

450
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:59,744
Megumi and Yuuta and their friends...

451
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:02,814
And I have you, Nakajima...

452
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:04,144
And Natsumi.

453
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:10,354
I love my job, and want to do it forever...

454
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,224
I do, too.


455
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:18,464
I've loved it for long time...

00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,024
Natsumi Senpai's really gone...

470
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:55,764
While she was here, there was
never a dull moment,

471
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:58,634
but now that she's gone, it's not quite the same...

472
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:00,764
We're really going to miss her...

473
00:24:00,764 --> 00:24:02,834
Hey! You make it sound as though I died!

474
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,004
Where did you come from?

475
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:07,974
Next time on "You're Under Arrest."
File 25: "Crossing the Bridge to Tomorrow".

476
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:08,144
You guys can't do a thing without me, after all!
