I'm late! I'm late!

Miyuki!

'Morning!

Good morning.

Yoriko, how're those plans going?

Trust me! I've got everything covered!

Natsumi Senpai is sure going to be surprised!

Saori, do you have today's activities planned?

Not yet...

That's Tsujimoto for you...

Tardy even on her last day at work.

No, she'll be coming soon.

Shall we get started, then?

Good morning!

I did it!

I finally broke my string of continuous tardies!

You know your partner well.

Oh yes.

Huh?

Farewell Party for
Officer Natsumi Tsujimoto!!
Huh?

Farewell Party for
Officer Natsumi Tsujimoto!!

Separate Ways

You know, I think I understand why you take
such good care of the Today.

Why are you suddenly getting so sentimental?

It doesn't match me, huh?

Shall we get going, then?

Right!

As usual, there're a lot of parking violations here.

Natsumi, you seem quite gung-ho today.

Really?

Did I just see a grin on your face?

Not at all.

Don't try to hide it.

You show your feelings more than
you think you do.

Especially when you're thinking about
a certain someone.

Honestly...

He's turning into a one-way street!

Miyuki!

Right!
Miyuki!

Right!

You in the red van! Pull over immediately!

Crap!

Pull over!

He wants to play hardball!

He'll become a hazard if we don't move quickly!

You don't need to tell me.

Nitro on!

Driving 40 kph over the speed limit,

running a red light,

going the wrong way on a one-way street...

...and defying an order to pull over.

Trying to run cost you.

I'm sorry.

They're at it!

What?
They're at it!

You parked, even though you knew
it was a no-parking zone.

Rules are of benefit only when
each and every person obeys them.

Remember that!

That's odd... this area isn't
usually this congested.

An accident, maybe?

What's this?!

Sorry! Please stop!

The light is red! What were you doing?

My map...

This?

Here you go, Granny.

Thank you very much.

Where are you headed?

A place called Ryogoku...

Thank you so much.

I never expected you to do all this.

Don't mention it! This is part of our job.

Please pay more attention to red lights, though.

I will.

Whoa!

Your grandson lives in a huge place!

Quite impressive...

Excuse me!

Thank you for coming all this way.

Hey! Tachikawa, are you there?

Coming!

A sumo wrestler...

Huge!

You called, Stable Master?

Your grandmother's here.

Taro! Is that you, Taro?!

Is that you, Granny?

You came out here to see me?

Umm...

Yes?

You're welcome to come inside for some tea.

No thank you, we're still on duty.

I'd prefer chanko nabe over tea.

Natsumi!

Thank you very much.

Thank you!

Chanko nabe...

You could become one of them, eating that.

Cut it out.

It's cold and delicious!

Ramune at summer's end... How cool is that?

I hear you're going somewhere?

Well, yes...

I heard. It's that FBI place, right?

No, not quite.

I don't know much about it, but good luck.

How about another one?

Think of it as my going-away present.

Huh?

But...

Don't mention it.

When you come back, drop by again.

Thank you!

Hmm...

What is it?
Hmm...

What is it?

Nothing...

Hey, why don't we check on that shortcut?

Good idea.

Thank you for your cooperation!

It's almost surprising how many
fewer cars pass through.

Nowadays, there aren't many cars
even when you're not here on duty.

It's been a great help.

It looks like we're fine here, as well.

May I have a word with you, officers?

Yes, ma'am?!

We have something to tell you.

Yes?

Some people aren't obeying
the rules for trash days.

And at night, the motorcycles are so annoying...
especially on weekends.

An underwear thief?

Considering how lovely you are, I can see why...

But you see... it's Grandma's
that they're stealing.

Huh?!

What am I to do?
Huh?!

What am I to do?

Don't you get the feeling we're more like
community troubleshooters than traffic officers?

It's easy to ask you for help, Natsumi.

You think so?

Yes.

Does that mean the community's
accepted me as a full-fledged officer?

Could be...

Is it because of my continuous hard work
to protect the daily lives of others?

I've got good character.

What?

Why're you laughing?!

They probably just remember you
because you're always making such a scene.

Huh?

That's harsh!

We're back!

Thank you for your hard work, Senpai!
How was your patrol?

What? Is something the matter, Saori?

Nothing out of the ordinary, I'd say.

Today is a very special day for the two of you!

Okay, everybody!

Shall we head out for Officer
Natsumi Tsujimoto's farewell party?!

All right!

Huh? Just a minute...

We have paperwork to do...

I'll help you!

We can handle it.

No!

We want you there as soon as possible!
So I'll help!

Okay then, we're going on ahead.

Don't take long.

All right, if you're not on duty, let's get going!

Yes, sir!

Well, we'll be going...

Come quickly.

Ten-four!

Good work!

Senpai, this doesn't look like
Traffic Section work...

It probably isn't.

But these people do have a problem.

I'd like to help them as much as possible.

I'll keep that in mind.

Miyuki... Are you done?

Yes. I'll print it tomorrow.

I'm done here, too! Shall we get going?

C'mon! We're going to have fun!

We'll let loose tonight!

Yes!

Bokutou Police Station Traffic Section.

Well then...

Yes...
Well then...

Yes...
Chief will scold us if we're late! Let's go!

Chief will scold us if we're late! Let's go!

Yes!

What?! What is the location?

Hibari No. 2

What? Tsujimoto and Kobayakawa
are going to be late?

Huh?

Calm down, Saga.

Sorry, but I want you to assist them, Saga.

What?!

Take care of it.

Chief? Chief?!

They say it won't take long, so shall we begin?

Okay!

Let's start with a toast.

Knowing them, they'll be here in no time.

Yes, it's so typical of Natsumi.

A toast to Natsumi! Cheers.

Cheers.

Excuse us! Please let us through!

We're from Bokutou Police Station.

We didn't know what else to do.

We think a dog chased it up there,
but now it can't come down.

Oh dear... What'll we do?

Cats are your specialty, Natsumi.

You think?

When I look back, Tsujimoto was a fine officer!

That's right!

It is our duty to carry on Natsumi's work...

Umm... She isn't dead, you know...

Aoi! You have a problem with that?!

No, it's not that...

What time is your train?

I'm still fine.

It'll be lonely without Tsujimoto.

Yes.

For Kobayakawa, too.

But we won't have to worry about that, will we?

Excuse me!

Senpai! What's going on?

Saori, it's dangerous here, so stand back.

Where's Natsumi Senpai?

Senpai?!

You're all right now. I came to help you down.

Well, I'd better get going.

I see...

You're leaving?! You're leaving
before Natsumi even comes?!

I have a train to catch...

What's more important?
Your train or your girlfriend?!

Yoriko, that's enough.

Hey, Nakajima!
Make up your mind about Miyuki!

Hey, Chief!

You're not firm enough.

That's why we've got so many
wishy-washy guys!

I'm very sorry about that...

As long as you know!

Yoriko, you need to rest.

Hey, Aoi! You're the wishy-washiest of them all!

Are you a man or a woman?!
Make up your mind!

I have the body of a man,
but I'm a woman at heart.

There you go again!

Okay, let's find out!

Yoriko!

How unfortunate... You came all this way here.

No, Natsumi's being herself until the very end.

True...

See you.

Okay. Be careful.

He says that so casually...

Forgive me. But it's your fault, Yoriko,
for unbuttoning me...

I give up.
Forgive me. But it's your fault, Yoriko,
for unbuttoning me...

I think it got away from her.

This is scary, even for me...

Be a good little kitty and stay right there...

You won't run away anymore, right?

Come on...

Good kitty. You're safe now.

Oh no!

Natsumi Senpai!

Natsumi!

Natsumi!

Natsumi!

Senpai!

No way...

Natsumi...

Natsumi!

Up here!

Thank goodness.

Now then, what do we do with this little guy?

We can't take him to the Reverend...

Why don't we keep him at our Traffic Section?

I know! I know just the place.

They'll love him.

Sorry to keep you all waiting!

What the?!

Oh, Natsumi!

We were waiting for you. You're awfully late.

What is this?!

Everyone's already smashed...

Without today's guest of honor?!

Oh, Tsujimoto... are you drinking?

Jeez!

Tsujimoto.

You're late. You missed out...

"Missed out" nothing! It looks like
the party's already over!

I meant Senior Officer Tokairin.
He left a minute ago.

What?

We wanted to surprise you,
so we had him come over.

I see... we didn't make it in time.

Natsumi Senpai...

Darn...

Natsumi...

Senpai...

Because of that kitten,
all the food and drink is gone.

Too bad!

Before he left, the Senior Officer said
you acted like yourself until the very end.

Now then...

The guest of honor is here,
so the real party is about to begin!

Let's party!

Right!

I'm not letting you end the party like this!

We wouldn't think of it!

Great! Tonight's on Nakajima!

What?! Give me a break!

Oh, come on, don't be so modest!

Yoriko, are you all right?

Hey, Yoriko! It isn't your bedtime yet!

The drinking's just started!

Oh, it's you, Natsumi... What're you doing here?

What?!

Tonight is Natsumi's farewell party.

Fine!

I, Yoriko Nikaido, will liven up this party
by taking it all off!

Here I go!

You mustn't, Yoriko!

Then Aoi, you strip in my place!

Do it! Do it!

Yoriko! All the way!

Stop it! This is a special day!

Now, now...

Tonight, anything goes, Saga.

Chief! That is clearly sexual harassment!

Are you turning a blind eye to that?!

I wasn't...

Then why aren't you stopping Nikaido Senpai?!

Tsujimoto, do your best at your new post.

I will! Thank you!

To Natsumi.

Cheers!

Okay, I'm stripping, too!

I was waiting for that!

Chief! What're you doing?!

In the end, I never made it...

It's too bad we missed the Senior Officer.

No, I was talking about the bridge.

What?

I wanted to cross it at least once.

I know how you feel...

Now, let's go home and get a good night's sleep!

Aren't you leaving today?

Oh, that's right! Can't be tardy on my first day!

Good grief. I worry about your future.

I'm gonna do this! I feel fired up!

Miyuki! I'll race you back home!

What? Just a minute.

Go!
What? Just a minute.

What? Just a minute.

Wait, Natsumi.

Natsumi?

I feel sick...

Miyuki, call a taxi...

Pull yourself together!

I might not make it...

'Morning.

Good morning!

That so? Not even a call?

It's already been a while since she's gone there.

She might not have had the time.

This is Tsujimoto we're talking about.
She'll be fine.

Oh!

What is it, Saori?

This!

An e-mail!

E-mail?

"Dear Bokutou Police Station Traffic Section,
I presume all is well since we last met."

I, Natsumi Tsujimoto, am training hard
day and night with the Special Assault Team.

This place is every bit
as tough as people say it is.

By the end of day, even I am totally exhausted.

But the food here is the best!

Both in terms of quality and quantity,
I have no complaints!

I hope this e-mail at least gives you
an idea of how I feel.

From faraway skies,
I pray for everyone's success.

"Natsumi Tsujimoto."

What an odd e-mail...

That's the same old Tsujimoto!

Yes, it's so typical of Natsumi.

She was born for that job, don't you think?

Perhaps.

Totally.

Tsujimoto's doing her best.

I'm counting on all of you to do the same.

Yes, sir!

Patrol time!

I'll be counting on you!

See you again!

From Natsumi

Shall we get going, Saori?!

Yes! I'm counting on you!

Daddy! Aunty Miyuki is here!

Aunty!

Hi, Megumi.

Have you been well?

Yes!

Miyuki!

Look how big he's grown!

He's so cute!

He sure is. It's because you all
take good care of him.

He's very frisky, so we're very careful
he doesn't run away.

Is that so?

Miyuki, everyone at school is grateful.

There're much fewer cars on the streets around
school, so it's a lot safer to play.

Yeah. We're not afraid anymore.

You and your friends did that, right? Thank you!

Thank you!

Thank Natsumi for us, too.

I will. Thanks.

Bye-bye!

Come again!

Working in the community,
we get to meet all sorts of people.

It's stimulating and motivating!

Yes, it is...

Excuse me...

You're that policewoman
from the other day, aren't you?

Yes, I am.

There are fewer motorcycles at night nowadays,
so we've been able to get a good night's sleep.

You petitioned the Ward Office,
didn't you? Thank you.

No need to thank me. I'm very happy for you.

If you need anything else, don't hesitate to ask.

Yes, we will.

Bye.

Thank you!

Kobayakawa.

I'm glad...

Huh?

I'm glad I became a police officer.

I have all of you at the Traffic Section,
the people in the community,

Megumi and Yuuta and their friends...

And I have you, Nakajima...

And Natsumi.

I love my job, and want to do it forever...

I do, too.

I've loved it for long time...

but now that she's gone, it's not quite the same...

We're really going to miss her...

Hey! You make it sound as though I died!
