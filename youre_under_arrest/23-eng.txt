Starting up once more

Let's run towards tomorrow

I want you by my side

To make up what I'm missing

I'm afraid to be alone

I cannot show that weakness

Being together is the energy we need

To go to the future

Changing, soaring

Even if the sky is distant

I want to tell you that this passion

Gives me the strength to never give in

I won't hesitate anymore

I'm starting up so I can be myself

I'm very sorry!

Officer Saga's injuries were entirely my fault!

I was inattentive while on duty.

I take complete responsibility and
will accept any punishment.

Hold on, Tsujimoto.

It wasn't all that big of an accident,
so there's no need to...

But when it occurred, I was...

Good morning!

Saori!

You're well enough to return already?

I'm sorry for all the trouble!

Hey, are you sure you should be here?

Yes! It's only a sprain!

See? I'm fine!

Saori!

Saori!
Saori!

Saori!

Don't push yourself!

Sorry, Senpai. I should've been more attentive.

Saori! Saori!

Are you all right, Saori?

Saori!

I'm okay.

Ow!

Natsumi Senpai...

Everyone... I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

You don't need to apologize...

But the greatest fault lies with the dangerous
drivers who drive on streets closed to traffic!

Cracking down on them is our job
as police officers,

and it is my duty to keep public order
and maintain peace!

I can't take time off just because of a sprain.
Right, Senpai?

Huh?

Officer Saga is right!

Don't you agree, Tsujimoto?

Look after her until the end.

It's not like you to leave a job undone...

Undone?

Natsumi Senpai!

Please train me fully! I'm counting on you!

Saori...

All right, then!

Everyone, sorry for all the trouble I caused!

You're right!

I should give it my best shot, like I always do!

I'll start by totally getting rid of
those nasty shortcut drivers!

Everyone! We'll need your help!

All right!

Why don't we print leaflets telling people
not to use the shortcuts?

That's a great idea.

I'll do my best, too!

I'm really sorry about your leg.

Saga!

Yes, sir!

I understand how you feel, but I'm assigning
you desk work for the time being.

You can't do that! I really am fit for duty.

I'm sorry.

Leave it to me! I'll cover your share, as well!

I'm so sorry...

I'm of no use when you need me most.

Forget it! I'm the one at fault.

She's right! Natsumi has no problem
working for two!

It'll be a breeze.

Should I have said "eating for two"?

Yoriko!

Chief.

Let us use the patrol routes from my simulation.

Yes, of course.

What is that?

I used the maps from the shortcut guide

to create a simulation that will enable us
to patrol them efficiently.

I hope it will help everyone.

Way to go, Miyuki! We can always count on you!

All right, everyone to the conference room.

Yes, sir!

These red marks indicate shortcut checkpoints.

I compiled patrol routes that correspond
to times when traffic is heaviest.

There are three routes, and four checkpoints
that change every four hours.

Since these will be done
in addition to regular patrols,

we'll need the cooperation of everyone
in our Traffic Section.

Except Sundays
7:30-9:00

Excuse me... Here's a traffic safety leaflet.

Excuse me... Here's a traffic safety leaflet.

Even if you're in a hurry,
go the long way!!

During these hours, this street

During these hours, this street
is closed beyond this point.

If you're in a hurry, use the streets shown.

We appreciate your cooperation.

Easy for you to say, but what streets am I
supposed to use when they're all congested?

Before you talk about enforcing the rules,

why don't you provide us
with some roads we can use?!

Aoi!

This street is backed up until past noon.

Miyuki, do you read me?

Aoi? What's the matter?

Sorry to bother you, but we need you
to look up a route.

Sure. Go ahead.

We need get from Shin Ohashi Street,
past the license testing facility, to Harumi Bridge.

Ten-four.

There is a route that appears clear.
Do you have a notepad handy?

Are you sure it's clear?

Every street is congested at this hour.

It's the very latest information.

I guess I'll give it a try.

We appreciate your cooperation!

If I don't go through here,
it's an awfully long way around.

If I don't go through here,
it's an awfully long way around.

Please do it for the safety of the children.

Where did Saga go?

She said she had something to take care of...

Is that so?

Thank you for your cooperation!

Give these to everyone in your family, okay?

What is this?

Saori, don't push yourself.

I know! I won't get out of the car!

There... Right there!

That street was totally backed up!

Yes. Since students use that street, it's high risk.

Hello!

I'm back!

Tsujimoto... have you seen Saga?

Huh?

Saori said she had something
she simply had to take care of.

I see.

Tell her to do that on her own time.

Yes, sir. Absolutely!

Thanks to you, the number of cars
passing through have all but disappeared.

Everyone here is happy about that.

I see. I'm glad to hear that.

We'll continue our efforts for the time being.

Excuse me.

Muscat
Excuse me.

Muscat
We really are grateful to you.

Muscat
Please share these with everyone.

Please share these with everyone.

I will.

As a result of your hard work,

reports of people taking shortcuts
have decreased dramatically...

...and we haven't had any accidents
these past few days.

All right!

Is that so? It was worth the effort!

That's wonderful!

Yeah! You worked really hard, Saori!

Yes!

But the violators haven't disappeared.
Yes!

But the violators haven't disappeared.

That's right.

People take shortcuts because
the streets are congested.

Until the congestion disappears,
there will be more violators.

I see...

What can we do?

We can't enforce this year-round.

The Bokutou Ohashi Bridge.

The one under construction?

Yes.

Once it's finished, it should relieve
much of the congestion in this area.

That's why it's being built.

I see. We just have to continue
until the bridge is built.

That would make it easier to convince drivers.

You're right!

The drivers have to be patient
just a little while longer.

Let's all hang in there until
the bridge is completed!

We'll be counting on all of you.

Oh, that's right...

You'll be leaving soon for the
Special Assault Team.

But until then, I'll work as hard as I can!

As Officer Natsumi Tsujimoto of
Bokutou Police Station's Traffic Section!

That's how it's going to be.

Let's try not to get too sentimental, okay?

Someone was nice enough to give us these.

Let's all show our appreciation by enjoying them.

I'm all for that! They look delicious!

Hey, Tsujimoto! They're not all for you!

Shall I rinse them in the cafeteria?

We'll need plates, too.

Make sure you get enough for everyone.

We know.

Senpai! Wait for me!

Ouch!

Saori, are you all right?
Ouch!

Saori, are you all right?

I'm fine.

If it's about Natsumi, I'm...

No, that's not it.

I want the two of you to remain
the best of partners forever.

That's precisely why I have to do my best.

I became a police officer because
I admired the two of you.

That feeling hasn't changed at all.

I may never be able to replace Natsumi Senpai,

but I will become a police officer
you can rely on, Miyuki Senpai!

One day... for sure...

I just wanted you to know that.

Excuse me!

Ow!

Hey.

Working overtime?

Yes. I need to add new data to
update the patrol simulation.

I see... That's a lot of work.

Kobayakawa...

Don't overwork yourself.

Be sure you have no regrets.

Hi, Miyuki!

Off today?

Y-yes...

You'll stay a bit, won't you?

Let me finish up here,
and then I'll make some tea.

Umm...

Did you come to check out some parts again?

Or did you come for a deep discussion
on mechanics with Honda?

Unfortunately, he's out on a repair call.

Were the two of you supposed to meet here?

No, I was just in the neighborhood...

I hear work's keeping you very busy lately.

Ken says he's too busy and hasn't been by at all.

Sena... I have somewhere else
I have to be today.

Huh? You do?

I'll come again.

Miyuki...

She isn't herself...

Let her be!

We're talking about our son's future bride.

Could something have gone wrong
between her and Ken?

If it did, that's all the more reason
we need to keep out of it.

They need to agonize, get hurt,
and come up with their own solution.

What if Miyuki decides
she doesn't want to marry him?!

That woman is too good for Ken.

What?! Oh, Daimaru!

You're too slow!

Wait for me!
You're too slow!

It's Miyuki!

Aunty Miyuki!

Hi.

Huh? Where's Natsumi?

She's off today.

What? The police are taking the day off?

No, they're still working at the police station.

Aunty Miyuki, did you come by the shop?

Huh?

No, I was on my way to go shopping.

I want to come with you!

Aren't you all on your way home from school?

You should go straight home.

Shoot.

That's boring.

Oh, I just remembered...

Look out! Move out of the way!

Today at school...

Megumi!

Watch it!

You could've hit them!

Megumi, are you all right?

It's that guy again!

You know that car?

Yeah. He's always driving through here.

He zooms by, and scares us!

That's terrible.

This street is supposed to be closed
during these hours.

Why?

Miyuki, catch that dangerous guy
and give him a scolding!

Arrest him! Arrest him!

Don't worry!

Aunty Miyuki and the others will take care of it.

I see. She and Natsumi will
beat that bad guy up!

They're not going to beat him up.

Aunty Miyuki...
They're not going to beat him up.

Aunty Miyuki...
They're the police, so they're going to arrest him!

They're the police, so they're going to arrest him!

I want to be a policewoman when I grow up.

I'm going to be a policewoman
like you and Aunty Natsumi.

You're right. A police officer's job
is to keep everyone safe.

Leave it to us!

We're counting on you!

Good luck, Aunty Miyuki!

Okay!

Is it true that there are holes in our plan
to seal off the shortcuts?

Yes.

Cars still enter even during the hours
the streets are closed.

Here, for example.

And there are other streets where
cars can go through, as well.

Whoa...

They know these tiny streets that
aren't even on the shortcut map?

How'd you find them, Miyuki?

This shortcut passes through a route
that Bokutou Elementary School students use.

The children are at risk.

Unforgivable!

These selfish people don't give a hoot
about putting others at risk!

Natsumi.

I realized that a simulation alone is insufficient.

I couldn't have done this research without
talking to the people living in the area.

I need your help to prevent a
major accident from happening.

You got it!

That's what we do!

Right.

Okay, I'm counting on all of you!

Yes, sir!

I can't see why people would sit in all that traffic.

Nice...

Don't see any school kids today.
This going to be pleasant!

You in the car, pull over!

Crap!

This road is closed to traffic during these hours!

Contact everyone!

Ten-four!

Everyone, you'll be going home
with us today, okay?

Okay!

Yoriko!

He's here!

Okay! I'm on my way!

Be careful.

Take care of him!

Leave him to me!

Uh-oh!

That street's closed!

Nakajima! You know what to do!

Roger that!

Natsumi Senpai! He's headed your way!

Ten-four!

Damn!

You in the car! Stop right now!

Why're there cops all over the place?!

You're in my way!

Huh?! What's going on?!

How come I'm not moving?!

Did you think you could get away from
Bokutou Traffic Section?!

I'm sorry...

You're always doing crazy things.

Ouch!

Hold still.

Look, Miyuki...

When I get angry, I do things without
thinking of the consequences.

By the time I regret it, it's too late...

About that night, I'm really...

Time sure passes quickly.

Miyuki?

Becoming a police officer, being assigned to
Bokutou Station and being paired with you...

It all seems like only yesterday.

But time continuously moves on.

Even Saori has grown, but
I've remained halfway to nowhere.

I don't even know what I really feel.

When you told me that, I took it out on you.

I don't want to be left behind, alone...

I have to move forward.

Good evening, Honda.

Oh, hi. On your way home from work?

Yes...

There's a lot more to these two-wheelers
once you get to know them.

The owner installed a nice suspension,

but he said it rides choppy
and wanted me to have a look.

Honda...

Yes?

Umm... I...

That's right, you're good with motorcycles, too.

I'm glad you're here.

I changed the springs.

I thought that would help to hold the corners,
but some people think it makes the ride too soft.

What do you think?

I'm finding that assumptions
from my car days don't apply.

When I think I about it, I don't
know a thing about motorcycles.

What are your front settings?

13 expanded, 16 compressed.

Oh?

This is a rather high spring rate.

That's why I changed it.

I'm certain that will improve the suspension.

I thought so.

While we're at it, let's change this, as well.

You'd go that far?

Since we've started, let's go all the way.

Miyuki!

Natsumi!

Want to go for a drink?

I thought you'd say that, so I left my bike behind!

Just so you know, once we start,
we're drinking the night away!

Don't complain to me if you have a hangover.

You can't drink if you're afraid of hangovers!

C'mon, let's go!

Okay.

Why even bring it up?

The two of you were once a team.

You were separated so Saga could be trained.

All you're doing is going back
to the way things used to be.

You don't have to report every little change.

Chief...

Thank you very much!

Let's go, Natsumi!

Ten-four!

Case closed...

Nakajima!

Going out now?

Oh yeah! We're gonna do our best!

O-okay...

Nakajima!

Huh?

Thank you.

Huh?

I'm going to see you by myself

Just like on that day

I'm going to the place where the flowers bloom

At dusk, atop a hill

We stared at each other

We promised we would never part again

It becomes more pleasant to look back upon

Each time I reminisce about it

Such vivid days

Don't make me suffer anymore

I'm going to forget it

Forget about it

As we overcome it, we become adults

Don't hold me back, Blooming Days

Don't hold me back, Blooming Days

What? Tsujimoto is late for
her own farewell party?!

What a shame... Her boyfriend
came all the way here...

I'll liven up this party by taking it all off!

You mustn't, Yoriko!

Senpai, today is a very important day!

Next time on "You're Under Arrest".
