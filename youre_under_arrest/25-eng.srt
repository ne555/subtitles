1
00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:07,094
Starting up once more

2
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:15,634
Let's run towards tomorrow

3
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,174
I want you by my side

4
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:44,904
To make up what I'm missing

5
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:47,444
I'm afraid to be alone

6
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:51,934
I cannot show that weakness

7
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:56,554
Being together is the energy we need

8
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:59,254
To go to the future

9
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:03,054
Changing, soaring

10
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:06,854
Even if the sky is distant

11
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:12,034
I want to tell you that this passion

12
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:15,594
Gives me the strength to never give in

13
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:19,274
I won't hesitate anymore

14
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:24,944
I'm starting up so I can be myself

15
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:47,934
Good morning, sir.

16
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:49,404
'Morning.

17
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,934
Chief, regarding the report I submitted...

18
00:01:52,774 --> 00:01:55,214
The cherry blossoms have already begun to fall.

19
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:58,084
This year's cherry blossom party was a disaster.

20
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,184
It's like that every year.

21
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:04,054
That's true, but I want to get a taste
of the flower-viewing mood.

22
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:06,824
It's already been a year since
you joined us, Saori.

23
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:07,694
Yes!

24
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,594
You've gotten completely accustomed
to the Traffic Section.

25
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:13,664
Not at all... I have a long way to go.

26
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:16,294
I want to become like all of you.

27
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:20,204
I'm trying especially hard to fill in for Natsumi.

28
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:21,574
We're counting on you.

29
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,744
Is Natsumi doing okay?

30
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:23,944
Kobayakawa
Is Natsumi doing okay?

31
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,474
Kobayakawa
Yeah...

32
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:25,774
Tsujimoto
Yeah...

33
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:25,844
Tsujimoto

34
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,174
Tsujimoto
I wonder how she's doing.

35
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,044
What's this?!

36
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,374
Miyuki, is something the matter?

37
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:38,984
What could that stench be?!
It smells like rotting garbage!

38
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:39,384
Tsujimoto
What could that stench be?!
It smells like rotting garbage!

39
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:40,994
Tsujimoto
What could possibly be in there?

40
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,254
What could possibly be in there?

41
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:43,744
It's no good! I can't go near it!

42
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,164
Here goes.

43
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:52,364
What was that?!

44
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:54,674
What's wrong, Kobayakawa?!

45
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:00,474
Hey, are you all right?

46
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:05,844
Crossing the Bridge to Tomorrow

47
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:09,384
Rice balls, sandwiches, sweets and juices...

48
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:12,224
Of course they're going to be rotten and moldy.

49
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,894
Good grief! That was a horrible parting gift!

50
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,264
Was she planning on going into hibernation?

51
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,324
I don't think I can eat anything for a while...

52
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:23,694
It's something Tsujimoto would do.

53
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:26,164
Chief! This isn't funny!

54
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,434
We had to clean it up. Put yourself in our place!

55
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:29,434
Sorry.

56
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:32,844
It's as if Natsumi is still with us.

57
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:33,774
What?

58
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,514
You always knew when she was here.

59
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:42,854
She's not going to be easy to forget.

60
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,654
You make it sound as if being loud
was her only good point.

61
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:46,854
No!

62
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:49,794
She was that great a person!

63
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,624
She had her flaws,

64
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:55,294
but she made up for them with an
overabundance of enthusiasm and ability!

65
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:58,024
That is what we should applaud!

66
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,534
Should we be lavishing so much praise on her?

67
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:01,524
We should!

68
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:05,504
But seriously, you haven't heard from her at all?

69
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,274
No. She was never good at keeping in touch.

70
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:11,184
I wish I could see her sometime
and talk about things.

71
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,584
The next time you hear from her,
please let me know.

72
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:14,774
Sure.

73
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,384
Shall we get going?

74
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,284
Okay!

75
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:25,024
It won't be long...

76
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,534
We'll soon be able to cross that bridge.

77
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,664
Yes.

78
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:34,964
So when it's finished, pack the Motocompo
in the Today and cross that bridge for me.

79
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:55,194
Violations don't decrease no matter what we do.

80
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,294
How unusual. Do I sense negativity?

81
00:04:57,294 --> 00:05:00,064
No! This is our job!

82
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:02,564
If we can make people's lives even a bit
safer and more comfortable,

83
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,364
then our efforts will be rewarded!

84
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:08,404
Saori, you've already become
a full-fledged police officer.

85
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:12,234
Do you really think so? Full-fledged, huh?!

86
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:15,734
Wh-what's this?!

87
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,684
Saori!

88
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,854
You're lenient! You're too lenient!

89
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:28,584
With that kind of enforcement, no traffic
violators will ever be compelled to repent!

90
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,094
That's...

91
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:40,204
Strike Man, the crusader for Love, Justice
and Truth, has arrived!

92
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:41,374
He's back...

93
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,334
Just a minute! What do you think you're doing?!

94
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:45,704
Violators don't need repentance!

95
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:48,114
They need due punishment!

96
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,884
This is what I call social reform!

97
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,244
That's nothing but an excuse.

98
00:05:55,054 --> 00:06:01,224
My balls of Love and Justice will do the job
that you hapless officers will not!

99
00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:04,354
Take that! And that! And that!

100
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,564
What's he doing?! Stop it!

101
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:12,404
Well if it isn't Recycling Woman!

102
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:16,804
It appears you continue to live a sloppy life
devoid of repentance or contrition!

103
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:18,394
What?!

104
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:20,404
Natsu

105
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:22,844
Saori...

106
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:26,384
Don't stop me! I can't back down
from this challenge!

107
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:27,784
You've got the wrong hand on top.

108
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:29,884
How interesting!

109
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:32,624
So you want to become
Homerun Woman 2, do you?

110
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:36,494
Then hit my Strike Ball
of Love, Justice, and Truth!

111
00:06:36,824 --> 00:06:38,194
Here it comes!

112
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:40,854
Bring it on!

113
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,574
Saori...

114
00:06:56,444 --> 00:07:01,114
If you want to be called full-fledged,
hit my ball first!

115
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:03,484
This is so vexing!

116
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:04,924
Why can't I hit it?

117
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,514
Is it because I lack a sense of Justice?!

118
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,664
I don't think Justice has much to do with it.

119
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,854
And besides, Natsumi was the only one
who could hit that.

120
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,854
Forgive me, Natsumi Senpai!

121
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:19,704
EACH SWING WITH STRIKE DOWN
ALL MY MIGHT STRIKE MAN!

122
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,904
EACH SWING WITH STRIKE DOWN
ALL MY MIGHT STRIKE MAN!
...98, 99, 100!

123
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:22,904
...98, 99, 100!

124
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:25,404
You'll hurt yourself if you overdo it.

125
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:29,344
No! I swear on Natsumi Senpai's bat
that I will hit his pitch!

126
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:32,384
Miyuki! Big news!

127
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,784
What is it?

128
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:36,144
Assistant Inspector Kinoshita's here.

129
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:37,884
Assistant Inspector Kinoshita?

130
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:39,954
Now that Bokutou Ohashi Bridge is completed,

131
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:42,254
there will be festivities next week
to commemorate its opening.

132
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,754
We need the Traffic Section to handle
preparations and security for the event.

133
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:51,764
They're expecting more congestion
than previously anticipated.

134
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:55,434
We'll need the Traffic Section
to work even harder.

135
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:57,574
Work at the festivities?

136
00:07:57,574 --> 00:08:00,514
You're not making us do the
Color Guard again, are you?!

137
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,274
Not that!

138
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,714
Don't worry. There'll be no Color Guard this time.

139
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:09,284
Yuka Hasumi will be the special guest
at the festivities.

140
00:08:09,284 --> 00:08:10,984
Yuka Hasumi?!

141
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:11,854
She's coming again?!

142
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,794
I'm going to get her autograph this time!

143
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,984
There's going to be quite a crowd.

144
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:19,764
I'll be looking forward to your
cooperation and efforts.

145
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:20,724
Yes, ma'am!

146
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:22,434
Do a good job.

147
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:23,424
We will!

148
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:26,724
Excuse me, Assistant Inspector Kinoshita.

149
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:28,204
Yes?

150
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:31,844
How is Natsumi, I mean Officer Tsujimoto?

151
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,334
The same. She's highly regarded.

152
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:36,214
I see...

153
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:40,314
But I'm told she might be fired
for being too unruly...

154
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,304
Oh no! Is that true?

155
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:45,684
Are you that concerned about her?

156
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,594
She's doing better than we expected.

157
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,394
She hasn't complained even once
about the intense training.

158
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:54,794
Natsumi hates to lose.

159
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,164
So do you.

160
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:59,394
Yes. I can't lose to Natsumi.

161
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:01,374
Working here...

162
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,274
Yes!

163
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:05,244
...you may be separated from her,
but you're still a fine partner.

164
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,294
Yes!

165
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:08,574
Good luck.

166
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:10,204
Thank you very much!

167
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,854
I'm told Natsumi's doing well.

168
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,254
Good to hear it.

169
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,594
It's lovely...

170
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:25,864
Yes...

171
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,564
I wonder if Natsumi's looking at this, too.

172
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:29,124
You miss her?

173
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,704
I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

174
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,074
We've been together all this time.

175
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,544
I know...

176
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:41,244
But you'll stay with me, won't you, Nakajima?

177
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,244
Of course I will...

178
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:48,214
I mean... I want to be with you...

179
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:50,414
But if you don't want me to...

180
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:56,084
No, even if you don't,
I want to be with you, Kobayakawa.

181
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:00,724
Thank you.

182
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:11,444
It looks like traffic will change drastically
once the bridge is completed.

183
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,174
I think we should change our patrol routes.

184
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:17,614
But it should reduce the number of drivers
who use shortcuts.

185
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:20,554
Yes, just as you predicted, Kobayakawa.
I have to hand it you.

186
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:21,884
I've had enough of this!

187
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:24,124
You're creating a nuisance!

188
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,524
We can't move from here!

189
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:27,994
Is something the matter?

190
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,354
Police officer!

191
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,864
These people put up a tent here.

192
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,524
They're obstructing the sidewalk
and making a mess! It's terrible!

193
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,304
Are you camping here?

194
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,904
We're trying to be first in line to cross the bridge.

195
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,924
That's why we staked out this spot.

196
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:45,404
You're those guys who are obsessed
with being first for everything.

197
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:48,844
This is a public sidewalk.
You'll need to leave immediately.

198
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:49,774
But...

199
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,114
Out of my way!

200
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:54,784
I can get to the sales faster this way!

201
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:55,684
Here she comes...

202
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:57,054
The Moped Mama!

203
00:10:57,454 --> 00:11:00,924
This bridge isn't open yet. You can't go across!

204
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,924
That's right! We're going to be
the first ones across!

205
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:05,264
Get in line!

206
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,394
Keep quiet! You're in my way!

207
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:09,594
I'm not letting you through!

208
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:10,994
We won't let you!

209
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:12,734
Shouldn't we stop them?

210
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,674
Could you stop them, Nakajima?

211
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,474
What?!

212
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,634
I'm counting on you.

213
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,234
But...

214
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,374
Let go of me! The sale's going to end!

215
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:23,474
I'm not letting you go!

216
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,414
You three, let me handle this. Let go of her.

217
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:28,884
Senpai?!

218
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:31,074
Coming through!

219
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,054
Nakajima Senpai!

220
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:37,924
Let me go! Out of my way!

221
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:39,754
Help me!

222
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,264
Good grief.

223
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:46,604
She always shows up when we're busiest.
What a nuisance!

224
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:50,804
I thought that it was impressive that
you held on until the very end.

225
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:53,274
Nakajima Senpai, I'm terribly sorry.

226
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:56,114
It's nothing to worry about.

227
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,634
She ended up going to a different sale.

228
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:01,254
I need some help here.

229
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,044
Yes, sir.

230
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:08,424
These are the decorations and props
for the bridge-opening festivities.

231
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:11,054
We'll be keeping them here
until the day of the event.

232
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:12,664
Which means...

233
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:13,324
Carry these inside.
Which means...

234
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:14,094
Carry these inside.

235
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:15,464
I thought so...

236
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:19,904
Also, the kusudama is a special one,
so handle it with care.

237
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,504
Oh, and one last thing...

238
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:28,044
Good grief... Chief shouldn't
have accepted this job!

239
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:31,014
He had no choice. They didn't have
enough decorations.

240
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:34,714
This is vital to the public's happiness.

241
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:35,874
Let's do our best!

242
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:38,284
Here, this is for the kusudama.

243
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:40,854
Thanks! I'll take care of the kusudama!

244
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:41,854
Nakajima...

245
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:42,554
Huh?

246
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,164
You do that part like this.
The base goes this way.

247
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:47,464
Like this?

248
00:12:47,464 --> 00:12:49,064
Yes. You're good at it!

249
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,034
Really?

250
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:54,304
Nakajima, are you acting clumsily
so that you can get Miyuki's attention?

251
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:55,434
No way!

252
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,974
It's not like that!

253
00:12:56,974 --> 00:13:00,714
That's right. Nakajima really is clumsy. Right?

254
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,074
Well...

255
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,474
You two seem to be getting along well...

256
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,184
Did Chief go home already?

257
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:11,014
I don't know... He hasn't come back.

258
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:17,794
Don't you think that leaving this sort of work
to the women is a form of sex discrimination?

259
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:18,764
Gulp!

260
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,284
That's not true. Chief has a lot to keep him busy.

261
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:27,064
Besides, Chief seems even
clumsier than Nakajima.

262
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:30,434
I guess we can just ignore him!

263
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,914
I'll go make us some tea.

264
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,004
Thanks!

265
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,544
Huh? What are these?

266
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,794
You seem happy, Yoriko.

267
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,974
The decorations we worked so hard to make
are going to be center stage!

268
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,964
That's not a bad feeling.

269
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,964
Chief! What do you think?
Pretty good, huh?

270
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:11,744
Wonderful... I couldn't have
made them, anyway...

271
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:13,584
Did something happen to Chief?

272
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:16,144
He's probably nervous since this is a big event.

273
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:19,954
Here she comes!

274
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:21,624
It's Yuka Hasumi!

275
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:23,254
How do you do?

276
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:27,254
That completes the preparations.
Now all we have to do is...

277
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:29,134
What is it, Aoi?

278
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,804
I get the feeling we forgot something...
like something's missing...

279
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,164
Bokutou Ohashi
Bridge Opening Celebration
I get the feeling we forgot something...
like something's missing...

280
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,034
Bokutou Ohashi
Bridge Opening Celebration
No!

281
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:37,034
I wish I could see the festivities, too.

282
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,544
Sorry, but work comes first.

283
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,844
Yes, you're right.

284
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:42,814
Hi! We came to see!

285
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:43,844
Hi.

286
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,614
Hi, everyone.

287
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:49,484
There are lots of people today,
it's not safe to be by yourselves.

288
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,784
Don't worry! Adults came with us!

289
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,524
We came with Daddy and the others.

290
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:54,954
Miyuki!

291
00:14:54,954 --> 00:14:56,794
Hey, this is quite a crowd.

292
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,194
Good afternoon.

293
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:00,994
Be careful not to get lost.

294
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:02,234
Not us!

295
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,834
We're not babies!

296
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,864
Yuuta and Shou always run off on their own.

297
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,804
Yeah.

298
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:10,534
We'd better hurry up or
we won't find a good spot.

299
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:14,074
Okay, let's go. We'll see you later, Miyuki.

300
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:15,164
Okay.

301
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,484
Look at all these people!
It's not going to be easy.

302
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,184
That's right. Please keep an eye on the children.

303
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,114
Kobayakawa!

304
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:23,204
Ken!

305
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:24,884
Dad, you're here, too?

306
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,624
We came to watch you do your job.

307
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,484
Well, good luck.

308
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:30,654
Thank you.

309
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:36,694
We have an emergency!
The kusudama isn't here!

310
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:37,634
The kusudama?

311
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,534
Huh?

312
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,364
Oh no!

313
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:40,194
What?!

314
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:44,374
I'm sorry! I forgot the all-important kusudama!

315
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:45,744
Save the regrets for later.

316
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,574
We have less than an hour
before the festivities start.

317
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:48,544
Right!

318
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:52,614
Tokuno?!

319
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:56,654
The Traffic Section's gone,
so I'm watching the office.

320
00:15:56,654 --> 00:16:00,314
Thank you for your help.
We came back for something we forgot.

321
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,754
Here it is! Thank goodness!

322
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,324
Saori, hurry!

323
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:05,294
Right!

324
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:08,094
Good grief. Never a dull moment
at the Traffic Section.

325
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,564
Do you think we'll make it in time?

326
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,194
By the skin of our teeth.

327
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:16,074
A traffic jam? All the way here?

328
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,094
Oh no!

329
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:25,814
Traffic Section.

330
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:28,954
Tokuno? Did Miyuki get there yet?

331
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,284
A few minutes ago.

332
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:33,384
The streets headed in this direction
are backed up solid!

333
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:34,654
That's not good.

334
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:37,424
They might not make it back in time.

335
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:38,764
Don't worry.

336
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:43,264
You've always found some way to
come through no matter what.

337
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:44,964
Huh? Tokuno?

338
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:47,864
That's how it is here at Traffic Section, right?

339
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,144
We're not going to make it!
I'll carry it there myself!

340
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,274
Wait! There has to be a way.

341
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:58,184
But...

342
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,974
Don't give up until the very end!

343
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,314
If we detour around this street...

344
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,484
I might be able to...

345
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:05,884
But there are more cars than normal.

346
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,454
A motorcycle! That's it... I'll call Nakajima.

347
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,964
Working hard, Traffic Section?

348
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,464
Need help?

349
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:17,434
Natsumi?!

350
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:18,764
Natsumi Senpai?!

351
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:22,304
They said the bridge was completed,
so I wanted to cross it.

352
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,404
I insisted on a day off and
went to the Traffic Section.

353
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:26,704
Then Detective Tokuno said you had
some sort of emergency,

354
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:28,744
so I grabbed this and came after you.

355
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:30,514
You should've called!

356
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:33,344
That's right! We were all worried about you!

357
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:37,054
Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to keep it
a secret or anything.

358
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:39,254
Natsumi, are you wearing your uniform?

359
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:42,794
Yeah, don't know why, but there was
a clean one in my locker.

360
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:45,454
Thought I'd wear it for old times' sake.
Was that wrong of me?

361
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:49,564
That's the one we washed
because it was growing mold...

362
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:50,794
What?

363
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:53,834
What's so funny?!

364
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:57,004
It's nothing! We don't have much time.

365
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:57,974
Natsumi!

366
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:02,034
Did I make it in time?

367
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,444
This street.

368
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:05,884
I know. The one we always covered.

369
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,784
Traffic is heavy today, so be careful.

370
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:09,814
Okay!

371
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:10,844
Natsumi!

372
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:12,824
I'm counting on you.

373
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:14,014
Ten-four!

374
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:19,424
Natsumi Senpai will come through for sure!

375
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:20,524
Yes, she will!

376
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:23,524
Saori, get the latest information
from Traffic Control.

377
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:24,834
Right!

378
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:28,804
Natsumi Senpai!

379
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:30,034
Saori?

380
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:34,344
A change in your route.
Turn left at the second corner.

381
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,174
Okay! Guide me!

382
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,814
Chief, how are the preparations coming?

383
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:42,714
They're proceeding on schedule. Don't worry.

384
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:44,244
Please see to it.

385
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:48,124
If anything goes wrong,
it'll be the Traffic Section's fault...

386
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:50,024
No, my fault.

387
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,424
They're taking so long!

388
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,024
Hey! Isn't it here yet?

389
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:54,934
No...

390
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,264
Nakajima, contact Kobayakawa!

391
00:18:57,264 --> 00:18:57,864
Huh?

392
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:58,164
Now!
Huh?

393
00:18:58,164 --> 00:18:58,904
Now!

394
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,664
Yes, sir!

395
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,274
Is there something wrong?

396
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,464
Nothing's wrong!

397
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:05,074
Huh?

398
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:06,774
Hi.

399
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:09,174
Geez! I'm so close!

400
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:10,874
Okay, here goes!

401
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:13,514
Please make three lines.

402
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:14,784
Yo! Working hard?

403
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,144
Who was that?

404
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,254
What did you just say? Tsujimoto?!

405
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:18,984
Excuse me! Coming through!
What did you just say? Tsujimoto?!

406
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,544
Excuse me! Coming through!

407
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:23,024
Natsumi?

408
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:24,224
She's back?!

409
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:26,394
Excuse me!

410
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:28,094
Please let me through!

411
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:29,894
Natsumi!

412
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:31,264
What're you doing?

413
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,934
Good to see you again!

414
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:33,964
Aunty Natsumi!

415
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,634
Hey! How're you all doing?

416
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,204
It's Natsumi!

417
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:39,104
I'll come by later!

418
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:40,374
Natsumi!

419
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:42,714
Excuse me! Please let me through!

420
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,774
Hi, Officer!

421
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:44,984
Good afternoon!

422
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,444
What? Natsumi?!

423
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:48,514
What? Tsujimoto?!

424
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:50,344
Tsujimoto is back?

425
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,154
I'll drop by some time!

426
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:54,824
Bokutou Ohashi

00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,454

Oh... I'm so close!

428
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:57,654
Bokutou Ohashi

Natsumi!

429
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:01,264
You're heavy!

430
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,764
Over here!

431
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:04,124
Shoji!

432
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,494
Catch!

433
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:12,274
What?!

434
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:19,584
Strike Man, the crusader for Love, Justice,
Truth and Firsts, has arrived!

435
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,514
What an entrance! I can't beat that.

436
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,624
I'll be the one who crosses this bridge first!

437
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,284
Therefore, this kusudama is mine!

438
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:29,554
Hey you! Give back the kusudama!

439
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:30,794
Natsumi!

440
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,224
He's always obsessed with being first!

441
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:34,764
Natsumi Senpai! Use this!

442
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:34,994
Natsu
Natsumi Senpai! Use this!

443
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:35,994

The word "first" was meant for me!

446
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:42,334
Bokutou Ohashi

How dare any of you try to cross before me!

How dare any of you try to cross before me!

Stop it!

449
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:43,804
Stop it!

450
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:45,574
I challenge you, Strike Man!

451
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:48,944
Oh! If it isn't Homerun Woman!

452
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:52,184
You haven't learned your lesson and
want to challenge me again?

453
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,644
Fine!

454
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:57,584
I will prove to you there is a pitch in this world
that cannot be hit!

455
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,544
You're on.

456
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:17,324
You did it!

457
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:19,764
I blew it...

458
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,634
We'll meet again, Homerun Woman!

459
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:29,714
Will he be all right?

460
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:33,324
He's fine! He's not the type
to let this get him down.

461
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,344
But next time...

462
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:41,124
Right! Next time, I'll hit a homerun for sure!

463
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:42,364
He's all yours.

464
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:43,354
You can count on me!

465
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:47,834
So today commemorates the birth
of Homerun Woman 2?

466
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,534
Sounds good to me.

467
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:56,074
All right, let the real festivities begin!

468
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:59,744
Members of Bokutou Police Station
Traffic Section, lead the way!

469
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:03,414
Tsujimoto, let's put you two back together.

470
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,284
Huh?

471
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:08,354
Natsumi, didn't you say you wanted
to cross the bridge?

472
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:09,884
But I...

473
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,364
Don't be modest.

474
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,594
It's not like you!

475
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,024
Go ahead.

476
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:15,424
Natsumi...

477
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:19,924
Okay!

478
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:27,934
Mou ichido starting up
Starting up once more

479
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:36,474

Let's run towards tomorrow

480
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:05,584
Motomeru mono ga uso ja naindatte kitzukidashita
I realized that the thing I want is not a lie

481
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:12,884
Tatakau mae ni akirameru nante mou yosou
Let's not give up before the fight

482
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:19,864
Kitto koushite deaeta koto guuzen ja nai yo ne
Our meeting probably isn't a coincidence

483
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:28,394
Kanawanai mono nante shinjiteireba kitto nai
If we believe we can take on anything, we can

484
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:32,744
Tsutaetai kono jounetsu ga makenai tsuyosa e to tsunagaru
I want to tell you that this passion

I won't hesitate anymore. I'm starting up so I can be myself

488
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,764
Nakajima invited Miyuki on a trip to a hot spring!

489
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,994
So Nakajima finally decided to make his move!

490
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,064
But do you really think those two
will make any progress?

491
00:23:57,064 --> 00:24:00,604
We'll have to see their future through at all costs.

492
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:01,374
Chief!

493
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:03,074
Then are we all going to the hot spring?

494
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,074
Next time on "You're Under Arrest."

495
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:07,974
File 26: "Hot Spring? Summer Kimono?
Marriage Proposal?"

496
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:08,144
Nakajima! Be a man!

497
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,444
Hot Spring? Summer Kimono?
Marriage Proposal?
Nakajima! Be a man!

498
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:11,144
Hot Spring? Summer Kimono?
Marriage Proposal?

499
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:14,184
