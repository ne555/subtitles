1
00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:07,094
Starting up once more

2
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:15,634
Let's run towards tomorrow

3
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,174
I want you by my side

4
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:44,904
To make up what I'm missing

5
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:47,444
I'm afraid to be alone

6
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:51,934
I cannot show that weakness

7
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:56,554
Being together is the energy we need

8
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:59,254
To go to the future

9
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:03,054
Changing, soaring

10
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:06,854
Even if the sky is distant

11
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:12,034
I want to tell you that this passion

12
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:15,594
Gives me the strength to never give in

13
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:19,274
I won't hesitate anymore

14
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:24,944
I'm starting up so I can be myself

15
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:08,154
Bokutou Police Station's Best Partners


16
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:08,624
Bokutou Police Station


17
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:10,184
Bokutou Police Station
I'm very sorry!

18
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:13,524
Officer Saga's injuries were entirely my fault!


19
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,884
I was inattentive while on duty.

20
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:21,134
I take complete responsibility and
will accept any punishment.

21
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:23,034
Hold on, Tsujimoto.

22
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:26,704
It wasn't all that big of an accident,
so there's no need to...

23
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,574
But when it occurred, I was...

24
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:29,904
Good morning!

25
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,584
Saori!

26
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,454
You're well enough to return already?

27
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,154
I'm sorry for all the trouble!

28
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,654
Hey, are you sure you should be here?

29
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,784
Yes! It's only a sprain!

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,654
See? I'm fine!

31
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:44,724
Saori!

32
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:44,794
Saori!
Saori!

33
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:45,594
Saori!

34
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:47,084
Don't push yourself!

35
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:52,834
Sorry, Senpai. I should've been more attentive.


36
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:55,374
Saori! Saori!

37
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,234
Are you all right, Saori?

38
00:02:58,074 --> 00:02:59,104
Saori!

39
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:00,174
I'm okay.

40
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:02,164
Ow!

41
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:05,844
Natsumi Senpai...

42
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:09,514
Everyone... I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

43
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:10,454
You don't need to apologize...

44
00:03:10,454 --> 00:03:15,324
But the greatest fault lies with the dangerous
drivers who drive on streets closed to traffic!

45
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:21,294
Cracking down on them is our job
as police officers,

46
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:25,734
and it is my duty to keep public order
and maintain peace!

47
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:29,934
I can't take time off just because of a sprain.
Right, Senpai?

48
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:30,844
Huh?

49
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,674
Officer Saga is right!

50
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:34,974
Don't you agree, Tsujimoto?

51
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,774
Look after her until the end.

52
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:40,214
It's not like you to leave a job undone...

53
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:41,414
Undone?

54
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,614
Natsumi Senpai!

55
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:45,784
Please train me fully! I'm counting on you!


56
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:47,754
Saori...

57
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,494
All right, then!

58
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:55,994
Everyone, sorry for all the trouble I caused!

59
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,564
You're right!

60
00:03:57,564 --> 00:04:00,004
I should give it my best shot, like I always do!

61
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:04,444
I'll start by totally getting rid of
those nasty shortcut drivers!

62
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,274
Everyone! We'll need your help!

63
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:10,244
All right!

64
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:13,414
Why don't we print leaflets telling people
not to use the shortcuts?

65
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:15,184
That's a great idea.

66
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,984
I'll do my best, too!

67
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:19,424
I'm really sorry about your leg.

68
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:20,524
Saga!

69
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,524
Yes, sir!

70
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:25,064
I understand how you feel, but I'm assigning
you desk work for the time being.

71
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,364
You can't do that! I really am fit for duty.

72
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:29,624
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:33,304
Leave it to me! I'll cover your share, as well!

74
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:34,574
I'm so sorry...

75
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,234
I'm of no use when you need me most.

76
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,664
Forget it! I'm the one at fault.

77
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:45,284
She's right! Natsumi has no problem
working for two!

78
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,514
It'll be a breeze.

79
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,314
Should I have said "eating for two"?

80
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:49,714
Yoriko!

81
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:50,844
Chief.

82
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:54,754
Let us use the patrol routes from my simulation.

83
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,154
Yes, of course.

84
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:57,394
What is that?

85
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:00,864
I used the maps from the shortcut guide

86
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:04,104
to create a simulation that will enable us
to patrol them efficiently.

87
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,104
I hope it will help everyone.

88
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:08,964
Way to go, Miyuki! We can always count on you!

89
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:11,704
All right, everyone to the conference room.

90
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:12,544
Yes, sir!

91
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:16,114
These red marks indicate shortcut checkpoints.

92
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:21,254
I compiled patrol routes that correspond
to times when traffic is heaviest.

93
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,984
There are three routes, and four checkpoints
that change every four hours.

94
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:29,694
Since these will be done
in addition to regular patrols,

95
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,764
we'll need the cooperation of everyone
in our Traffic Section.

96
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:33,464
Except Sundays
7:30-9:00

97
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,594
Except Sundays
7:30-9:00
Excuse me... Here's a traffic safety leaflet.

98
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,664
Excuse me... Here's a traffic safety leaflet.

99
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:37,364
Even if you're in a hurry,
go the long way!!
Bokutou area route map

100
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:40,404
Even if you're in a hurry,
go the long way!!
Bokutou area route map
During these hours, this street
is closed beyond this point.

101
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:41,174
During these hours, this street
is closed beyond this point.

102
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,164
If you're in a hurry, use the streets shown.

103
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:47,274
We appreciate your cooperation.

104
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:52,944
Easy for you to say, but what streets am I
supposed to use when they're all congested?

105
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,554
Before you talk about enforcing the rules,

106
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,054
why don't you provide us
with some roads we can use?!

107
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:58,544
Aoi!

108
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,894
This street is backed up until past noon.


109
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:05,994
Miyuki, do you read me?

110
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:07,834
Aoi? What's the matter?

111
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,134
Sorry to bother you, but we need you
to look up a route.

112
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:13,134
Sure. Go ahead.

113
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:18,504
We need get from Shin Ohashi Street,
past the license testing facility, to Harumi Bridge.

114
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,534
Ten-four.

115
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:23,344
There is a route that appears clear.
Do you have a notepad handy?

116
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:26,004
Are you sure it's clear?

117
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,114
Every street is congested at this hour.

118
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:30,114
It's the very latest information.

119
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:32,614
I guess I'll give it a try.

120
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,154
We appreciate your cooperation!

Bokutou Police Station
If I don't go through here,
it's an awfully long way around.

123
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:38,464
If I don't go through here,
it's an awfully long way around.

124
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,864
Please do it for the safety of the children.

125
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,464
Where did Saga go?

126
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:49,704
She said she had something to take care of...

127
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:51,364
Is that so?

128
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,934
Thank you for your cooperation!

129
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,814
Give these to everyone in your family, okay?

130
00:06:57,814 --> 00:06:59,544
What is this?

131
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,254
Saori, don't push yourself.

132
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:05,374
I know! I won't get out of the car!

133
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:09,724
There... Right there!

134
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:12,394
That street was totally backed up!

135
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:17,704
Yes. Since students use that street, it's high risk.

136
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,304
Hello!

137
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:20,734
I'm back!

138
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:24,104
Tsujimoto... have you seen Saga?

139
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:24,974
Huh?

140
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:30,104
Saori said she had something
she simply had to take care of.

141
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:31,974
I see.

142
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:35,114
Tell her to do that on her own time.

143
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,414
Yes, sir. Absolutely!

144
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:55,174
Thanks to you, the number of cars
passing through have all but disappeared.

145
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,934
Everyone here is happy about that.

146
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,244
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

147
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,274
We'll continue our efforts for the time being.

148
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:02,174
Excuse me.

149
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:02,644
Muscat
Excuse me.

150
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,544
Muscat
We really are grateful to you.

151
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,684
Muscat
Please share these with everyone.

152
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:07,144
Please share these with everyone.

153
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:08,844
I will.

154
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:11,654
As a result of your hard work,

155
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:15,154
reports of people taking shortcuts
have decreased dramatically...

156
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:18,064
...and we haven't had any accidents
these past few days.

157
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,124
All right!

158
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,394
Is that so? It was worth the effort!

159
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:23,294
That's wonderful!

160
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,934
Yeah! You worked really hard, Saori!

161
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:26,434
Yes!

162
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:26,834
But the violators haven't disappeared.
Yes!

163
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:30,904
But the violators haven't disappeared.

164
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:32,544
That's right.

165
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,944
People take shortcuts because
the streets are congested.

166
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:41,214
Until the congestion disappears, there will be more violators.

167
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:43,254
I see...


168
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,154
What can we do?

169
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:48,794
We can't enforce this year-round.

170
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,124
The Bokutou Ohashi Bridge.

171
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:52,264
The one under construction?

172
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,224
Yes.


173
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:57,504
Once it's finished, it should relieve
much of the congestion in this area.

174
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,904
That's why it's being built.

175
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:04,804
I see. We just have to continue
until the bridge is built.

176
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:08,444
That would make it easier to convince drivers.

177
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:09,614
You're right!

178
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:12,644
The drivers have to be patient
just a little while longer.

179
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,054
Let's all hang in there until
the bridge is completed!

180
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,644
We'll be counting on all of you.

181
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,854
Oh, that's right...

182
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:22,254
You'll be leaving soon for the
Special Assault Team.

183
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:25,494
But until then, I'll work as hard as I can!

184
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:29,964
As Officer Natsumi Tsujimoto of
Bokutou Police Station's Traffic Section!

185
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:32,104
That's how it's going to be.

186
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,474
Let's try not to get too sentimental, okay?

187
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,604
Someone was nice enough to give us these.

188

00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:39,744
Let's all show our appreciation by enjoying them.

189
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:42,374
I'm all for that! They look delicious!

190
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,714
Hey, Tsujimoto! They're not all for you!

191
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:45,744
Shall I rinse them in the cafeteria?

192
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,254
We'll need plates, too.

193
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,954
Make sure you get enough for everyone.


194
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,214
We know.

195
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,684
Senpai! Wait for me!

196
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:54,724
Ouch!

197
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:55,294
Saori, are you all right?
Ouch!

198
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,824
Saori, are you all right?

199
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:58,524
I'm fine.

200
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,164
If it's about Natsumi, I'm...

201
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:03,594
No, that's not it.

202
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:08,074
I want the two of you to remain
the best of partners forever.

203
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,974
That's precisely why I have to do my best.

204
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:14,614
I became a police officer because
I admired the two of you.

205
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,944
That feeling hasn't changed at all.

206
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:20,284
I may never be able to replace Natsumi Senpai,

207
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:23,984
but I will become a police officer
you can rely on, Miyuki Senpai!

208
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,844
One day... for sure...

209
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:32,294
I just wanted you to know that.

210
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:33,484
Excuse me!

211
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:38,134
Ow!

212
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:50,314
Hey.

213
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:51,514
Working overtime?

214
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:56,354
Yes. I need to add new data to
update the patrol simulation.

215
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,714
I see... That's a lot of work.

216
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:07,854
Kobayakawa...

217
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,734
Don't overwork yourself.

218
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:31,144
Be sure you have no regrets.

219
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:58,474
Hi, Miyuki!

220
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:00,654
Off today?

221
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:01,854
Y-yes...

222
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,984
You'll stay a bit, won't you?

223
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:05,624
Let me finish up here,
and then I'll make some tea.

224
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,784
Umm...

225
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,024
Did you come to check out some parts again?

226
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:12,724
Or did you come for a deep discussion
on mechanics with Honda?

227
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:15,624
Unfortunately, he's out on a repair call.

228
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,504
Were the two of you supposed to meet here?

229
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,504
No, I was just in the neighborhood...

230
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,704
I hear work's keeping you very busy lately.

231
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:26,674
Ken says he's too busy and hasn't been by at all.

232
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:29,944
Sena... I have somewhere else
I have to be today.

233
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:31,184
Huh? You do?

234
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,614
I'll come again.

235
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:34,314
Miyuki...

236
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,084
She isn't herself...

237
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:38,684
Let her be!

238
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:41,594
We're talking about our son's future bride.

239
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,394
Could something have gone wrong
between her and Ken?

240
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:47,894
If it did, that's all the more reason
we need to keep out of it.

241
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:53,134
They need to agonize, get hurt,
and come up with their own solution.

242
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:57,544
What if Miyuki decides
she doesn't want to marry him?!

243
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,674
That woman is too good for Ken.

244
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,234
What?! Oh, Daimaru!

245
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:13,424
You're too slow!

246
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:14,544
Wait for me!
You're too slow!

247
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,524
It's Miyuki!

248
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:18,824
Aunty Miyuki!

249
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:20,224
Hi.

250
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:21,764
Huh? Where's Natsumi?

251
00:13:21,764 --> 00:13:23,664
She's off today.

252
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,134
What? The police are taking the day off?

253
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:29,074
No, they're still working at the police station.

254
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,974
Aunty Miyuki, did you come by the shop?

255
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:31,844
Huh?

256
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:35,314
No, I was on my way to go shopping.

257
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,674
I want to come with you!

258
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,644
Aren't you all on your way home from school?

259
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:40,084
You should go straight home.

260
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:40,914
Shoot.

261
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:42,254
That's boring.

262
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,944
Oh, I just remembered...

263
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,814
Look out! Move out of the way!

264
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,324
Today at school...

265
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:50,224
Megumi!

266
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,204
Watch it!

267
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:08,734
You could've hit them!

268
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,874
Megumi, are you all right?

269
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,014
It's that guy again!

270
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,654
You know that car?

271
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,684
Yeah. He's always driving through here.

272
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,954
He zooms by, and scares us!

273
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,324
That's terrible.

274
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:26,564
This street is supposed to be closed
during these hours.

275
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:27,754
Why?

276
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:32,334
Miyuki, catch that dangerous guy
and give him a scolding!

277
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,174
Arrest him! Arrest him!

278
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,534
Don't worry!

279
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:38,404
Aunty Miyuki and the others will take care of it.

280
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:41,894
I see. She and Natsumi will
beat that bad guy up!

281
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:43,914
They're not going to beat him up.

282
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:44,284
Aunty Miyuki...
They're not going to beat him up.

283
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,114
Aunty Miyuki...
They're the police, so they're going to arrest him!

284
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:45,774
They're the police, so they're going to arrest him!

285
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,814
I want to be a policewoman when I grow up.


286
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:55,844
I'm going to be a policewoman
like you and Aunty Natsumi.

287
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:04,764
You're right. A police officer's job
is to keep everyone safe.

288
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:05,934
Leave it to us!

289
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,004
We're counting on you!

290
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:09,174
Good luck, Aunty Miyuki!

291
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,634
Okay!

292
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,834
Is it true that there are holes in our plan
to seal off the shortcuts?

293
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:40,834
Yes.

294
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:44,844
Cars still enter even during the hours
the streets are closed.

295
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:45,874
Here, for example.

296
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:49,074
And there are other streets where
cars can go through, as well.

297
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,374
Whoa...

298
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:54,754
They know these tiny streets that
aren't even on the shortcut map?

299
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,584
How'd you find them, Miyuki?

300
00:15:57,684 --> 00:16:01,124
This shortcut passes through a route
that Bokutou Elementary School students use.

301
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:01,424
Bokutou
Elementary
School
This shortcut passes through a route
that Bokutou Elementary School students use.

302
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:02,554
Bokutou
Elementary
School
That's awful!

303
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:05,024
Bokutou
Elementary
School
The children are at risk.

304
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,524
Unforgivable!

305
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:10,464
These selfish people don't give a hoot
about putting others at risk!

306
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:11,764
Natsumi.

307
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:14,274
I realized that a simulation alone is insufficient.


308
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:18,374
I couldn't have done this research without
talking to the people living in the area.

309
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,934
I need your help to prevent a
major accident from happening.

310
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:25,174
You got it!

311
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,344
That's what we do!

312
00:16:28,884 --> 00:16:30,014
Right.

313
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,644
Okay, I'm counting on all of you!

314
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:33,874
Yes, sir!

315
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:41,024
I can't see why people would sit in all that traffic.

316
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,564
Nice...

317
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:47,234
Don't see any school kids today.
This going to be pleasant!

318
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:48,994
You in the car, pull over!

319
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:50,074
Crap!

320
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,634
This road is closed to traffic during these hours!

321
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,374
Contact everyone!

322
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:55,304
Ten-four!

323
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:58,744
Everyone, you'll be going home
with us today, okay?

324
00:16:58,744 --> 00:16:59,874
Okay!

325
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:00,944
Yoriko!

326
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:03,184
He's here!

327
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:04,584
Okay! I'm on my way!

328
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,654
Be careful.

329
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:06,854
Take care of him!

330
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,824
Leave him to me!

331
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:13,394
Uh-oh!

332
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:16,234
That street's closed!

333
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,664
Nakajima! You know what to do!

334
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:18,654
Roger that!

335
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,004
Natsumi Senpai! He's headed your way!

336
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:23,934
Ten-four!

337
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,134
Damn!

338
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:28,144
You in the car! Stop right now!

339
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:30,104
Why're there cops all over the place?!

340
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:38,144
You're in my way!

341
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,094
Huh?! What's going on?!

342
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:44,884
How come I'm not moving?!

343
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:01,374
Did you think you could get away from
Bokutou Traffic Section?!

344
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,474
I'm sorry...

345
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:06,614
You're always doing crazy things.

346
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:08,154
Ouch!

347
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,584
Hold still.

348
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,214
Look, Miyuki...

349
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:20,694
When I get angry, I do things without
thinking of the consequences.

350
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,794
By the time I regret it, it's too late...

351
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:26,504
About that night, I'm really...

352
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,994
Time sure passes quickly.

353
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:30,564
Miyuki?

354
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:35,374
Becoming a police officer, being assigned to
Bokutou Station and being paired with you...

355
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,614
It all seems like only yesterday.

356
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:41,204
But time continuously moves on.

357
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:46,754
Even Saori has grown, but
I've remained halfway to nowhere.

358
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:49,154
I don't even know what I really feel.

359
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:53,684
When you told me that, I took it out on you.

360
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:57,434
I don't want to be left behind, alone...

361
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,264
I have to move forward.

362
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:15,474
Good evening, Honda.

363
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:19,324
Oh, hi. On your way home from work?

364
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,684
Yes...

365
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:23,854
There's a lot more to these two-wheelers
once you get to know them.

366
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:25,594
The owner installed a nice suspension,

367
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:28,434
but he said it rides choppy
and wanted me to have a look.

368
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,434
Honda...

369
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,364
Yes?

370
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,934
Umm... I...

371
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:41,234
That's right, you're good with motorcycles, too.

372
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,374
I'm glad you're here.

373
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:45,444
I changed the springs.

374
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:50,714
I thought that would help to hold the corners,
but some people think it makes the ride too soft.

375
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:52,054
What do you think?

376
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:57,824
I'm finding that assumptions
from my car days don't apply.

377
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:02,164
When I think I about it, I don't
know a thing about motorcycles.

378
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,104
What are your front settings?

379
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,764
13 expanded, 16 compressed.

380
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,074
Oh?

381
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,104
This is a rather high spring rate.

382
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:13,544
That's why I changed it.

383
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:17,074
I'm certain that will improve the suspension.

384
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:18,414
I thought so.

385
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:21,154
While we're at it, let's change this, as well.

386
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,954
You'd go that far?

387
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:25,614
Since we've started, let's go all the way.

388
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,594
Miyuki!

389
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:44,734
Natsumi!

390
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,114
Want to go for a drink?

391
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,584
I thought you'd say that, so I left my bike behind!

392
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:56,514
Just so you know, once we start,
we're drinking the night away!

393
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:03,024
Don't complain to me if you have a hangover.

394
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:05,524
You can't drink if you're afraid of hangovers!

395
00:21:05,524 --> 00:21:06,524
C'mon, let's go!

396
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:07,554
Okay.

397
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,764
Why even bring it up?

398
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:15,434
The two of you were once a team.

399
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:18,244
You were separated so Saga could be trained.

400
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,234
All you're doing is going back
to the way things used to be.

401
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,614
You don't have to report every little change.

402
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:24,844
Chief...

403
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,614
Thank you very much!

404
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:28,654
Let's go, Natsumi!

405
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,914
Ten-four!

406
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:33,254
Case closed...

407
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,694
Nakajima!

408
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,254
Going out now?

409
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,664
Oh yeah! We're gonna do our best!

410
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:41,334
O-okay...

411
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,494
Nakajima!

412
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:43,464
Huh?

413
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:47,634
Thank you.

414
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,664
Huh?

415
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:37,084
I'm going to see you by myself

416
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:40,954
Just like on that day

417
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:44,794
I'm going to the place where the flowers bloom

418
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:49,464
At dusk, atop a hill

419
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:53,604
We stared at each other

420
00:22:53,604 --> 00:23:00,574
We promised we would never part again

421
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:04,644
It becomes more pleasant to look back upon

422
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:08,684
Each time I reminisce about it

423
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:11,554
Such vivid days

424
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:16,624
Don't make me suffer anymore

425
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:20,654
I'm going to forget it

426
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:25,004
Forget about it

427
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:33,034
As we overcome it, we become adults

428
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:41,134
Don't hold me back, Blooming Days

429
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:50,084
Don't hold me back, Blooming Days

430
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:54,024
What? Tsujimoto is late for
her own farewell party?!



431
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:56,394
What a shame... Her boyfriend
came all the way here...

432
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,864
I'll liven up this party by taking it all off!

433
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:00,164
You mustn't, Yoriko!

434
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:02,464
Senpai, today is a very important day!

435
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:07,004
Next time on "You're Under Arrest".
File 24: "Separate Ways".

436
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:08,144
Everyone's already smashed!

437
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,014
Separate Ways
Everyone's already smashed!

438
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,144
Separate Ways

439
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:14,184
