00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,320
I'll be playing in the Shoujiki Cup College Judo Tournament team matches tomorrow,

2
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,290
and I'll be participating in the individual matches the next day.

3
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,730
I will win, win, and win it all, th-then...

4
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,960
then I, Hanazono Kaoru, will show myself to you!

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,260
Well then, good night!

6
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,230
But what if he doesn't win, win, and win it all?

7
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,650
Then what will happen?

8
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,360
"Who is his famous Coach X?"

9
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
What the hell?

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,480
That would be me!

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,490
That's not all. Inokuma Yawara also helped him train.

12
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,890
They've been working for months without missing a day.

13
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,500
Focus, Hanazono-kun!

14
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,630
Inokuma Yawara and Inokuma Jigoro trained Hanazono...

15
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,270
without missing a day?

16
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,310
You can do it!

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,290
I!

No one from Ebitendo has ever made it to the semis!







31
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,380
Who the hell was spreading the rumors about Hanazono's womanizing?

32
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,920
That was you. Now apologize to him.


33
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,430
W-Well, we don't need to sweat the small stuff.

Please eat as much as you like!

No, wait, that's right!

What happened to Fujiko-san? What?

59
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,410
Did you know about Hanazono-kun's training?

60
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,790
Y-Yeah, Hanazono told me everything!

61
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,750
So what happened to Fujiko-san?

62
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,750
I keep getting her answering machine.

63
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,280
What?!

64
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,640
Why didn't you call her sooner?!

65
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,470
I couldn't reach her last night either!

66
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,220
Sheesh!

Going where?

To look for Fujiko-san on my motorcycle!

71
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,570
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

72
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,910
Oh gosh, I secretly doubted you, Hanazono-san!

73
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,200
I didn't believe you would win it all!

74
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,710
I'm sorry, Hanazono-san!

There's a ton of fellas out there who are stronger than you!

100
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,190
You'll need keen techniques and good positioning to take 'em on!

101

Quit depending on your strength! Techniques and positioning!

102
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,910
Faster! Okay, one, two, three, four!

103

So this is it for you, Hanazono?

104

It's no use. He's not coming out of the toilet stall!

No, it's Hanajima.

Got it!

154
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,730

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,200
H-Hanazono-san!

179
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,440
Go get him, Hanazono!

180
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,460
If you beat him, you're the champ!

181
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,210
No way! Hanazono-san is in the final round?

182
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,590
Wh-Who's he playing?

183
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,680
I-Inagaki-san!

184
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,770
I can't!

185
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,270
I can't watch!

186
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,140
Yuko!

187
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,980
Hanazono!

188
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,860
Wow!

189
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,860
I-I thought I told you <i>not</i> to lose focus!

190
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,460
Inagaki's focusing just fine!
 He's just facing the wrong opponent!

191
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,940
Huh, Master Jigoro?

192
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,460
I hear that Hanazono's got himself one helluva coach!

193
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,030
A hell of a coach? Who would that be?

194
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,210
Koka!

195
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,520
There he goes again!

196
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,230
Keep it up, Hanazono-kun!

197
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,040
Who the hell was his coach?

198
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,900
That'd be me!

199
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,740
That's right, me!

200
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,000
Wh-What did you say?

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,250
Y-You coached that Hanazawa or whatever his name is?

202
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,460
His name's Hanazono.

203
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,560
Why would you do that?

204
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,640
Are you trying to spike Saikai U's hopes just out of spite?

205
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,550
It ain't outta spite.

206
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,860
Training Hanazono also gave Yawara a danged good intensive workout.

207
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,850
What?

208
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,100
Don't worry your pretty little head.
 Hanazono still ain't worth a damn.

209
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,180
Oh no!

210
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,590
Hang in there, Inagaki-senpai! Don't lose!

211
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,070
Wh-What's happening?

212
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,080
Ah, Ito-san! Don't stand there asking questions, just cheer!

213
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,290
Why did Inagaki-san give up a Yuko to that Hanaoka guy?

214
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,800
That's it. Keep it up! Mix it up with more moves!

215
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,910
H-Hanazono-san?

216
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,310
Mate!

217
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,570
I-Inagaki!


218
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,610
That Hanazono switches moves very quickly.

219
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,780
Inagaki-san is so caught up in Hanazono's pace that he's lost his usual rhythm!

220
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,830
Hanazono-san... i-is beating <i>the</i> Inagaki-san? No way!

221
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,330
Hajime!

222
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,200
Don't rush it!

223
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,040
If you plant your feet more, you'll get an Ippon!

224
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,050
You're not going to get an Ippon...

225
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,300
off me!

226
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,470
Watch out!

227
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,680
Waza Ari!

228
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,020
He turned the tables!

229
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,400
Great! He's firmly in the lead!

230
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,280
You got it in the bag, Inagaki-san!

231
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,780
Numbskulls!

232
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,410
His opponent's playing Inokuma judo!

233
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,910
If he doesn't get an Ippon, he might get Ipponed!

234
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,200
That's right!

235
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,250
Though right now, that Inagaki of yours seems to have calmed down.

236
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,500
Hanazono, on the other hand, has gotten 'bout as stiff as a board.

237
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,090
Hajime!




238
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,220
I hope you're still winning, Hanazono!

239
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,020
Keep at it! Fight a great match so I can write a great article!

240
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,190
Yuko!

241
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,420
Way to go, Inagaki!

242
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,410
Now you got a Waza Ari and two Yukos!

243
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,470
This is pretty much Inagaki's match!

244
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
You did great to the end, Hanazono!

245
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,290
Coach!

246
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,840
I could only dream of my player getting a Yuko and a Koka off Inagaki!

247
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,300
You're right. The way he made it to the final round was a miracle in itself!




248
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,560
You still have a chance, Hanazono-kun!

249
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,230
There's still a minute left!
 The fight's just begun!

250
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,230
You've practiced so much, so I know your chance will come, Hanazono-kun!

251
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,070
Mate! Jougai!

252
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,530
Inagaki-senpai! Only 50 seconds left!

253
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,790
Don't let him get a good hold on you!

254
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,540
Inagaki! Inagaki!

255
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,300
Mate!

256
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,050
Hanazono-kun, focus! You still have a chance! Just play your own judo!

257
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,540
Hey, Inagaki!

258
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,060
Don't relax just because you have the lead!

259
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Your opponent's judo is all about getting Ippons!

260
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,560
Relax, Yutenji.

261
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,070
He ain't throwing no one by exerting all that strength.

262
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,620
Mate! Jougai!

263
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,320
Dumbass! How could you get thrown by that shrimp?!

264
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,210
Ten laps around the grounds!

265
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,720
Ito Fujiko's Ouchi Gari!

266
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,030
She advances to the final match of the All-Japan!

267
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,720
Hanazono-san?

268
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,180
I'm... I'm...

269
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,810
I'm such a disappointment!

270
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,200
Hanazono-kun!

271
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,990
Dammit! I guess I am...

272
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,210
I guess I am a failure, Fujiko-san!

273
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,500
Only twenty seconds left, Inagaki-senpai!

274
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,710
Inagaki-senpai! Get your second championship!

275
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,220
Inagaki! Inagaki!

276
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,680
Hanazono-san.

277
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,970
Hanazono-san!

278
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,610
Hanazono-san!

279
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,110
Hanazono-san, focus!

280
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,530
Fujiko-san!

281
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,740
Fuji...

282
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,580
I also pulled through in this kind of situation, so don't quit!

283
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,580
I!

284
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,150
Love!

285
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,960
You can do it!

286
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,500
You!

287
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,470
H-He did it!

288
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,070
Done!

289
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,470
What? That wasn't an Ippon?

290
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,070
Time ran out.

291
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,370
Hanazono-san.

292
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,210
I really... I really am a...

293

disappointment.



294
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,970
D-Don't come near me.

295
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,940
I-I stink of sweat.

296
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm a pathetic disappointment... who fails in everything he does.

297
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,280
No, you're not.

298
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,330
To me, you're the nation's...

299
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,040
no, you're the world's...

300
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,830
