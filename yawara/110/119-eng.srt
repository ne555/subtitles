00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,370
Fujiko-san, you need to be careful. There are icy patches on this path.

2
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,500
R-Right!

3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,130
I-Ino... Ino... Inokuma-san?

4
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,510
How many laps are you going to run along this bank?

5
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,380
Ten laps.

6
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,800
That sounds grueling!

7
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,350
But you need to get back into shape, so let's go for it.

8
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,140
Come on, let's run, Fujiko-san!

9
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,480
Okay!

10
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,100
Inokuma-san...

11
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,520
Fujiko-san...

12
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,320
I'm sorry for making you worry for so long.

13
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,830
Do not take Inokuma Yawara lightly!

14
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,710
She's a prodigy. She's not affected by an absence, you hear me?

15
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,090
That prodigy has now gotten serious. I've seen it with my own two eyes!

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,310
And it gave me goose bumps!

17
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,380
Kazamatsuri-kun.

18
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,060
Y-Yes, sir?

19
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,600
We're retraining her from the beginning!

20
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,270
Make sure all journalists are shut out.

21
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,940
We're on lockdown!

22
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:02,820
The Explosive Remark!



23
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,830
What should we do, Matsuda-san? We'll never get an article.

24
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,800
So that celebutante Honami Sayaka has locked out reporters? </i>

25
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,980
What kind of secret training is she conducting behind those doors?</i>

26
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,430
K-Kaga-kun?

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,760
Huh?

28
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,930
Kosaku!

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,310
H-How did you get inside, Kuniko-san?




30
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,320
Oh, that security guard was almost too easy!

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,570
S-So were you able to see Honami Sayaka's secret training taking place inside?

32
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,570
I saw it, all right.

33
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,330
All right! We've got a huge scoop!

34
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,290
No way, it's not even worth an article!

35
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,340
Sayaka-san was just having sex with Kazamatsuri-san!



36
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,340
It got so ridiculous that I left!

37
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,840
I swear to gosh!

38
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,800
H-Having sex with Kazamatsuri?

39
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,640
I-I think we've done enough, Sayaka-san.

40
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,870
No, we're not through yet!

41
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,090
Are you all right, Fujiko-san? Let's call it a day.

42
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,280
I'm fine. Honestly, I'm A-OK.

43
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,350
Besides, I need to give Fuku-chan her milk.

44
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,970
That's all right. I'll do it!

45
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,860
You should take a shower and get a massage from Grandpa!

46
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,240
N-No way! I let you take care of everything for me!

47
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,330
I'm fine...

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,360
I didn't say that!

54
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,180
I'm saying Fujiko-san can't compete in the All-Japan Championships!

55
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,800
Whaddaya mean, she can't?

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,180
She can do anything she puts her mind to!

57
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,440
You should know since you've been giving her massages!

58
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,840
She's really exhausted!



59
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,690
She's been absent for a long time.

60
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,240
And don't forget she just gave birth!

61
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,190
She also has her hands full raising a child!

62
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,940
I know darn well she's having a hard time!

63
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,290
I know 'cause as a young'un, I spent three days and three nights up on that mountain facing bears—

64
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,590
Grandpa, that wasn't normal. Don't compare it with her!

65
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,790
That's right. I'm a wunderkind!



66
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll make it through the tournament.

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,840
Just keep Fujiko-san out of the All-Japan and have her focus on the All-Japan Selected!

68
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,220
What if she gets injured because she wasn't ready?

69
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,610
You dummy!

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,680
You and Beanpole will sweep every tournament I enter you guys in with flying colors!

Thanks. We going somewhere to eat?

Hey, that's Grandpa Inokuma. He's been on TV a lot lately!

Wait, isn't this a bad time?

00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,700
Why?

We thank you for your wonderful comment on fashion!

Crap! Speak of the devil!

Oh no!

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,500
As you know, beauty comes from within.

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,660
I will still exude beauty even if you leave me in my natural state.

Of course.

Plain people can talk about training and tempering themselves.

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,640
I, however, have shone ever since the day I was born.

97
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Well, well.



98
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,070
It has been ages.

99
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,940
What? Grandpa Inokuma and Miss Sayaka ran into each other?

100
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,490
All right!

101
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,030
This is gold!


102
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,490
This is no time to be chasing after the Miyazawa Rika scandal!

103
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,710
You sure you wanna be traipsing around here in the middle of your "secret training"?

104
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,200
There's nothing actually secret about it.

105
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,760
If I receive too much attention, it will eclipse Yawara-san's big comeback.

106
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,220
The media attention her comeback is receiving will prove short-lived,

107
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,120
as I will soon beat her back into oblivion.

108
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,230
I am generously letting her live out her dream before time runs out.

109
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,730
Then I guess you're entering the All-Japan Championships, ain't ya?

110
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Of course I am!






111
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,990
What is it? What is so funny?

112
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,750
We're withdrawing from the All-Japan!

113
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,250
Wh-What did you say?

114
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,050
You didn't have to take such a coward's way out!

115
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,540
Are you that afraid of me?

116
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,780
Don't be stupid!

117
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,140
I'm just givin' you the spotlight.

118
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,980
Y-You are giving me... the spotlight?

119
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,690
That's right!

120
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,140
You can enter the All-Japan, win the ribbon, and have the glory all to yourself.

121
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,360
You get to sit on the queen's throne a wee bit longer.




122
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,900
We're good with just one tournament.

123
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,370
With just the All-Japan Selected.

124
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,370
We'll win the ticket to Barcelona with just that one contest!

Till then, I hope that throne feels good under your butt!

Grandpa...

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
He thought about what's good for Fujiko-san.

130
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,300
He could have been a lot more honest, though.

131
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,860
The nerve of him!

132
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,110
In that case, I won't enter the All-Japan either!

133
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,080
I-Is that so? Then I agree!



134
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,200
I am worn out from all that rigorous training anyway.

135
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200

What do you think, Saito-san?

Ah, "brilliant" is the only word I can use to describe her today!


146
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,400
She's definitely confident after sweeping every major tournament last year,

147
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,960
but she's winning here with moves that are speedier and smoother than ever before!



148
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,630
Her secret training away from the media must be behind that.

149

Indeed!

150
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,470

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,470
W-Wrong?

152
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,380
That was a comment from our special guest, Master Inokuma Jigoro.

153
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,560
What do you mean by that?

154
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,900
She's still that highfalutin' heiress!

155
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,380
If you can get that good through mere practice,

156
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,800
she'd have opened that practice to the public, however much of an eyesore it was.

157
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,940
Right, Saito?

158
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,460
Oh? Yes.




159
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,450
So you're saying Honami has some sort of secret weapon?

160
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,060
Of course she does!

161
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,220
She's got a trick up her sleeve that she'll use in the upcoming Selected against Yawara!

162
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,210
She ain't gonna give us no preview of it!

163
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,590
Well, she'll whip it out sooner or later.

164
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,710
We'll just sit back, eat some snacks, and watch for it!




165

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,400
Right, Fuku-chan?

171
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,980
Don't teach her those words!

172
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,070
Anyway, Master Jigoro is right.

173
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,240
It all comes down to what sort of secret training your dad is giving Sayaka-san.

174
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,660
Dad...

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,250
Wow! There goes a favorite to win this tournament, Tohdoh Yuki!

176
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,420
Ippon!

177
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,360
Tohdoh is finished!

178
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,420
It's Takabe! Tababe with a marvelous Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi!

179
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,470
It was a fight between two strong veterans, and Takabe's strategy came out on top!

180
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,840
Compared to the flamboyant Honami,
 Takabe Yoko hasn't gotten much notice.

181
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,280
But she's definitely a skilled player!






182
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,190
She won her matches with a subtle,
 refined grace, and now she's in the finals!

183
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,860
These two polar opposites will battle for the throne!

184
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,200
eye catch

185
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,160

192
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,620
We're at the final match of the Women's All-Japan Judo Championships!

193
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,630
It's Honami with her fearsome skills,

194
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,630
versus the veteran 72 kg-and-under World Championship silver medalist, Takabe Yoko.

195
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,100
What kind of match will we see here today?

196
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,880
Yeah, I've been wondering about something for a while.

197
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,980
Honami couldn't have made such dramatic improvements on her own.

198
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,610
I wonder who the heck is coaching her?



199
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:27,780
Yes, mysteriously, among her coaches, only Coach Kazamatsuri knows that secret.

200
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,620
Well, in any case, it's certainly incredible.

201
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,480
Don't you agree, Master Inokuma?

202
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,370
It ain't nothing to get hysterical about!

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,330
He's just the number two coach.

204
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,550
Does that mean you know who Honami Sayaka's coach is?

205
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,090
The final match has begun!

206
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,190
You'd better show us something, Honami Sayaka!



207
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,690
Takabe goes for an Ashi Barai! What a bold offensive move!

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,440
Both players have a tight grip on the other and are positioned well!

209
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,240
So who'll make the first move?

210
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,620
Oh! Takabe with a Harai Goshi!

211
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,120
But Honami resists it!






212
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,830
Takabe immediately goes for a foot sweep!

213
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,580
This is looking good!

214
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,460
This is the first time Honami's faced Takabe, and she's having a tough time!

215
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,590
Takabe-san, keep it up! Strike first and win!

216
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,750
Takabe's dominating this match!

217
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,560
Honami's completely on the defensive!

218
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,020
Sayaka-san, don't tell me you're going to use that move?

219
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,110
Sayaka-san is planning to do something!

220
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,740
I-Ippon!

221
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,760
A-A Tomoe Nage!

222
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,800
Have we ever seen Honami use a Tomoe Nage before, Saito-san?

223
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,380
N-No. Perhaps that's the product of her secret training!

224
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,340
I have to agree! The veil has finally been lifted off her secret training!

225
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,660
A-Anyway, Honami has won the All-Japan Championships with a Tomoe Nage Ippon!

226
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,600
Kojiro-san?!

227
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,810
Ah, Kojiro-san!

228
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,180
What should we do?





229
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,980
Sayaka-san found Takabe too hard to handle

230
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,320
and unthinkingly used the secret move we were saving for Yawara-san!

231
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,820
No, she can use that if she wants to.

232
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,860
I don't care.

233
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,500
But...


234
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,160
That was amazing!

235
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,880
Even Takabe couldn't withstand the speed and crispness of that Tomoe Nage!

236
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,590
Honami's coach is certainly a cut above the rest!

237
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,640
Right, Master?

238
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,340
Feh!

239
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,800
That Tomoe Nage ain't worth bullspit against Yawara.

240
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,400
If he thinks that's gonna beat Yawara, then he's always gonna be the world's number two coach!

241
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,460
My son Kojiro will never beat me,
 'cause I'm number one!

242
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,310
He's just number two!

243
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,810
Oh...

244
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,230
Huh?!



245
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,220
If he's your son,

246
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,320
then does that mean Inokuma-san's father is Honami Sayaka's coach?!

247
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,420
We will now hear the ecstatic thoughts of the champion, Honami Sayaka!

248
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,170
Congratulations on your victory!

249
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,750
Your successive Ippon wins were incredible!

250
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,420
Oh, there is no need to make a fuss over that!

251
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,980
Also, were you planning to use that match-winning Tomoe Nage

252
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:43,440
as a secret weapon against Inokuma Yawara in the upcoming All-Japan Selected?

253
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,140
My keen judo skills allowed me to make that Tomoe Nage by instinct!

254
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,480
I do not consider Inokuma Yawara to be an opponent worthy of a secret move.







255
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,220
Yeah, right!

256
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,950
That Tomoe Nage didn't look like it happened by chance!

257
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,980
It looked like it had been honed through hours upon hours of practice

258
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,420
as a secret move against Yawara-san!

259
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:14,610
The upcoming All-Japan Selected is the qualifying tournament for the Barcelona Olympics.

260
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,920
How do you feel about your chances?

261
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,680
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

262
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,200
I am not overly concerned about the Olympics,

263
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,690
unlike that attention hog, Inokuma Yawara-san!

264
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,980
What is the meaning of that crowd over there?

265
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,840
Why are people gathering there, even though I'm the victor?

266
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,040
Th-This is huge! We've got big news!

267
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,080
Right now, Inokuma Jigoro just made an explosive remark!

268
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,940
Miss Honami's coach is Jigoro-san's son,

269
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,000
or in other words, Inokuma Yawara's own father! He has just revealed that!

270
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,500
What?!








271
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,710
Yeah, that's right!

272
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,970
Sayaka's coach is my own flesh and blood, Kojiro!

273
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,600
Grandpa.

274
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,970
Hey, is that true?!

275
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,480
If it is, we're taking Honami's victory off the front page!

276
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,230
Uh, excuse me...

277
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,230
Wh-What's the whole story behind that?

278
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,100
Who knows?! He's probably just after her huge compensation package!

279
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,150
He's just number two, while I'm number one!

280
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,200
So that means it's father against daughter?




281
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,870
Wh-Why did you do it?

282
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,080
Why did you say that?

283
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,710
Quit stooping to such despicable depths!

284
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:41,420
Do not use a dirty trick to draw the crowd away from the winner!


285
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,060
If you don't like it, come up on this mat and fight me!

286
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,390
I will not run or hide from you!

287
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,510
I ain't sure what you're saying, but I like that last part!

288
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,150
It's now or never for the both of us!

289
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,150
Indeed, the last chance to settle our feud has arrived!



290
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,660
Yep! At the upcoming All-Japan Selected Championships!

291
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,620
I-Inokuma-san?

292
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,320
Hi, Hanazono speaking.

293
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,090
Ah, Matsuda-san?

294
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,800
Yes, we saw it. I'll hand the phone to Inokuma-san.

295
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,560
Ah, is this Yawara-san?

296
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,140
W-We've really got a mess on our hands.

297
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,840
The media eats up stories like this!

298
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,070
You might have to deal with yet another frenzy for a while.

299
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,070
Yes, I know.

300
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,660
W-Wait, Yawara-san. I hope you're not skipping the next tournament because of this uproar?

301
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm more worried about Mom. What if she finds out?

302
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,550
What will you do?

303
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,040
If the journalists surround your house again, you may need somewhere to hide out—

304
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,300
That's all right. I'll go home.

305
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,520
Matsuda-san?

306
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,510
Thanks for being concerned about me.




307
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,850
Forget about that. Those reporters are on their way!

308
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,930
You'd better get home before...

309
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,190
Inokuma Yawara-san!

310
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,800
Can we have a comment?!

311
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,440
Sit down, you two!

312
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,450
Why did you hide that from me?

313
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,940
I heard that you two have known about it for nearly a year.

314
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,900
How could you not tell me something so important?

315
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,000
Still...

316
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,750
I'm so glad your father is still alive!

317
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,400
So, Mom...

318
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,220
Hm?

319
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,720
Are you... Are you sure it doesn't bother you?

320
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,040
Please, I thought he'd been eaten by a bear,

321
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,230
or attacked by a tsuchinoko or a hibagon.

322
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,230
Note: A "tsuchinoko" is a mythical venomous snake.
"Hibagon" is the Japanese version of Bigfoot.#

323
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,690
I'm happy just knowing he's alive.

324
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,290
Even though he's become Sayaka-san's coach in order to defeat me?

325
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,950
Just knowing where he is makes me feel relieved.

326
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,830
But... But what if I win the next tournament?

327
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,460
If that happens, Dad might disappear again!

328
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,460
Actually... I have a feeling your father will be coming home soon.

329
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Huh?

330
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,260
It's something I know in my heart.

331
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,220
However...

332
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,470
What?

333
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,470
If you hold back because you're facing your father...

334
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,440
I don't think he'll ever come back again.



335
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,440
So you need to give it your all.

336
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Sign: Oden#

337
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,950
Right, here's your konjac!

338
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,450
Oh yeah, your wife came here again the other day.

339
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,620
Pops.

340
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,040
I really like your oden!

341
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,870
Well, thanks a lot!

342
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,880
Can I get some daikon?

343
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,640
Sure!

344
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,390
Next time she comes, tell her I'm sorry for what I put her through.

345
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,390
Huh?

346
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,390
And also that everything will be settled soon.

347
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,600
All righty.

348
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,320
Can I get some octopus?

349
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,700
Sure. Octopus, right?

350
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,700
What on earth was that?!

351
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,900
I was the one who won!

352
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,540
I was supposed to be the star today!

353
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,760
Y-You're right. So maybe we should take a break from practice today.

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,200
I am going to grind her face into the ground...

355
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,560
at the All-Japan Selected!

356
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,080
Inokuma Yawara!

357
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,640
Grandpa! I thought I told you to watch your mouth. Why did you have to say that?!

358
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,070
What are you on about?

359
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,440
Thanks to that, Tamao-san now feels relieved, just like I knew she would!

360
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,660
Oh really ?




361
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,910
Anyway, Yawara, it's finally the All-Japan Selected Championships!

362
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,420
You're supposed to make short work of it and get that ticket to Barcelona!

363
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,680
Yawara!

364
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,440
The Comeback Ippon Zeoi!

365
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,920
The Comeback Ippon Zeoi!

366
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,360
You'll be getting my Harai Goshi if you don't watch!
