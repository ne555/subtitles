1
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,660
S. Honami... K. Inokuma.</i>

2
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,200
Wh-What do you mean?

3
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,120
Yawara-san found out about her father's dealings?!

4
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,580
I told her she was over-thinking the situation,

5
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,420
but it's only a matter of time before she discovers the whole truth.

6
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,880
Dad.

7
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,050
Dad...

8
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,400
No Longer Invincible


9
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,370
Inokuma Yawara's still not here?

10
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,160
Huh, you mean Inokuma?

11
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,790
Well, it sure looks like it.

12
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,350
Oh, balderdash.

13
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,380
It's true?

14
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,050
Her people don't know where she is.

15
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,380
B-But...

16
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,910
Hi, this is the Inokuma residence.

17
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,790
Ma'am? This is Ito!

18
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,090
What will we do? Her first match is coming up!

19
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,840
Yes, that's right! Inokuma-san still hasn't arrived!

20
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,550
That can't be! Yawara left the house early this morning.

21
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,310
You're kidding!

22
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,100
Really? Understood.

23
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,110
What happened to Yawara-san?!

24
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,110
Well? Has Inokuma-san arrived?

25
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,490
No, how about you?

26
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,200
They said she left her home.

27
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,820
What on earth are you doing, Inokuma?!

28
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,870
Crap!

29
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,740
We don't have to worry, do we?

30
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,880
She did arrive at last year's All-Japan in the nick of time!

31
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,880
I wouldn't be so sure.

32
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,630
Kazamatsuri?


33
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,380
Her absense may have slightly different implications this time around.

34
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,640
D-Damn you, Kazamatsuri!

35
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,640
You didn't spill the beans to Yawara-san, did you?!

36
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,980
I wouldn't!

37
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,600
You must've gone too far in an interview and let something slip.

38
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,110
I'd never tell her that!

39
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,110
Nor would I.



40
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,110
U-Um, what are you two talking about?

41
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,700
O-Oh, nothing at all, nothing at all! Right?

42
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,870
A-Ah, indeed, it's nothing important.

43
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,120
At any rate, Yawara-san has expressed her suspicions

44
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,640
that Kojiro-san is Sayaka-san's coach.

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,630
If she finds out the whole truth...

46
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,380
This is Yawara-san, after all.
 She'd never take on her own father.

47
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,730
Inokuma Yawara still hasn't shown up?

48
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,990
That petty girl is repeating the same routine to grab people's attention.


49
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,150
I can allow that.

50
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,110
Her days of arriving fashionably late to
 cheering crowds will soon come to an end.

51
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,410
She can enjoy her last gasp of popularity all she wants!

52
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,750
Matsuda-san!


53
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,680
I'm looking for her!

54
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,670
Wait, do you even know where to look?

55
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,630
Like hell I do!

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,810
Honorary advisor?

57
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,280
She's not here!

58
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,370
What's going on?

59
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,860
Inokuma Yawara's match is next!

60
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,520
We haven't caught even a glimpse of her.

61
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,560
What is going on with Yawara-san this time?

62
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,770
That's what I wanna know!

63
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,570
It's time for the next match!

64
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,570
That miserable idiot!

65
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,550
Dammit! Isn't there at least one, one little clue about where she is?</i>

66
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,050
We're here at the Yoyogi 2nd National Gymnasium, and the capacity crowd is roaring!

67
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,430
It's the first round of the 48 kg-and-unders, and we'll finally see our star player.

68
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,140
Of course, that would be Inokuma Yawara!




69
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,370
Will she extend her winning streak to three years?

70
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,110
Sign: Inokuma Yawara hasn't arrived yet!!#

71
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,940
Color commentator Saito-san...

72
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,290
Is that true?

73
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm very sorry, Matsuda-san. We always seem to cause you trouble.

74
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,880
There's no need to apologize.



75
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,930
Anyway, ma'am, do you have an idea, any idea where she is?

76
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,680
If I knew that, I'd already be on my way.


77
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,060
Anything at all! Like...

78
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,440
Oh yeah, did she and her father use to play together somewhere?


79
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,200
I-In that case, there was one place,
 but they practiced judo there instead.

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,990
Okay... Okay... Really? Got it!

81
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,540
Where's Inokuma?!

82
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,340
Inokuma!

83
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,340
Inokuma?!

84
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,310
What did you do with her?!

85
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,810
The crowds are beginning to realize that Inokuma Yawara hasn't arrived.

86
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,060
Her opponent, Okamura, can't hide her impatience.



87
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,850
Where's Inokuma?!

88
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,730
What's going on here, Saito-san?

89
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,900
This isn't good.

90
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,360
Inokuma also arrived late at last year's All-Japan.

91
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,280
I hope she makes it this time too, but...

92
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,040
This is beyond words.

93
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,790
What is going to happen here in the Yoyogi 2nd National Gymnasium?



94
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,330
What will happen to Inokuma's brilliant winning streak?

95
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,250
Inokuma's still not here! There's no sign of her!


96
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,170
And now, here it is, the inevitable!

97
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,260
The referees are coming in and bowing despite Inokuma's absence!

98
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,670
What's this?!

99
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,720
We want Inokuma!

100
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,940
Inokuma!

101
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,810
What's going on here?!

102
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,000
We came here to see Inokuma play!

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,770
Yawara-chan!

104
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,770
Inokuma-san!

105
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,860
Inokuma still hasn't arrived!

106
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,530
Her opponent, Okamura, enters the ring and does the pre-game bow by herself!



107
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,250
Oh, this is it!

108
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,260
The referee raises his hand toward Okamura!

109
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,120
Inokuma Yawara loses by default!

110
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,220
Her unprecedented winning streak has finally, finally come to an end!


111
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,940
All right, let's see that smile!

112
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,570
That's my girl!

113
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,090
M-Matsuda-san?

114
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,050
Dammit, I didn't make it in time?

115
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,160
Inokuma!

116
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,700
Come out!

117
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,470
This is huge, folks!

118
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,850
Inokuma Yawara, who once boasted an unstoppable winning streak, has lost by default!


119
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,110
Is she injured or sick? There have been no comments from her people!

120
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,860
Inokuma has also lost her ticket to the World Judo Championships.

121
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,700
The repercussions will be enormous!

122
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,750
A loss by default?

123
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,840
I can't believe she would actually run away out of fear that I'd throw her.



124
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,010
Inokuma Yawara is indeed a most contemptible coward!

125
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,700
What in the world happened, Inokuma-san?

126
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,760
F-Fujiko-san...

127
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,020
She lost by default... at a tournament with that Honami brat!

128
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,020
M-Master!



129
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,780
I'm hungry. Let's go get some lunch!

130
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,030
Uh, Master!

131
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,030
M-Milady!

132
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,030
Tokunaga, bring the car around to the entrance! We're leaving!

133
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,040
M-Milady!

134
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,120
Wait a minute, Sayaka-san! What about your matches?

135
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,460
Don't you want to show the results of your strenuous European dojo challenge tour?

136
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,630
Dojo challenge tour?


137
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,800
That was a wasted effort.

138
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,310
A cowardly opponent who runs from a battle wasn't worth all that training.

139
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,770
Incidentally, Kazamatsuri-san.


140
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,020
Yes?

141
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,520
I hope you haven't forgotten

142
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,280
what would happen after I settled my score with Inokuma Yawara.

143
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,780
We'll be preparing for our wedding, of course!


144
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,790
Where are you going?

145
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,540
You're up next. Go back and change!

146
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,040
You haven't settled any scores!

147
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Don't act so conceited!

148
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,050
Go to the tournament ring!

149
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,720
Tokunaga, get my judo gi!

150
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,770
O-Of course!

151
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,360
Amazing. He bent Sayaka-san to his will.</i>

152
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,280
Even Sayaka-san knows deep in her heart</i>

153
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,320
that she has become frighteningly strong, thanks to his training.</i>

154
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,410
At any rate...</i>

155
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,050
Shin-chan's outta trouble!</i>

156
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,030
Still, Yawara-san...</i>

157
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,610
Why did you skip the tournament?

158
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,410
Great handstand, Sako-chan!

159
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,160
I rolled over!

160
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,990
Matsuda-san, did you play with your father as a kid?

161
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,950
Uh, yeah.

162
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,540
We played catch, wrestled each other, and played oicho-kabu. 

163
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,530
I don't have any of those memories.

164
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,300
I only remember throwing my dad.

165
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,650
So you found out about your old man, huh?

166
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,860
You knew all along, Matsuda-san?

167
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,240
You knew?

168
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,700
You knew that my dad was Sayaka-san's coach and hid it from me?

169
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,670
Honami Sayaka can't be beat!

170
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,980
Her first match took thirteen seconds,

171
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,170
and here in the second round she got another Ippon in just seven!



172
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,300
Honami Sayaka's performance today more than makes up for Inokuma's absence!

173
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,840
Of course it would.

174
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,760
The speed and crispness of her moves has increased a few...

175
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,390
no, a dozen times over since she came back!

176
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,150
It looks like her European dojo challenge tour has paid off, Saito-san.




177
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,020
Yes, she's improved beyond expectations.

178
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,280
Who could possibly be her coach?

179
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,400
Way to go, Lady Sayaka!

180
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,420
Go get 'em!

181
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,530
My princess!

182
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,450
When? When did you learn that my dad was coaching Sayaka-san?

183
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,500
Right after the Seoul tournament.

184
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,880
So when I threw Sayaka-san at last year's All-Japan, my dad was coaching her?

185
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,510
Yeah.


186
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,220
That would mean I threw my dad again.

187
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,230
H-Hey!

188
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,100
P-Please, wait!


189
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,190
Judo matches have nothing to do with parent-child relationships!


190
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,880
Your old man just accepted Sayaka's job offer and nothing more.

191
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,860
You don't get it, Matsuda-san!

192
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,750
My judo broke up my family.

193
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,960
My dad left to go train because I threw him when I was five.



194
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,630
Now he's trained Sayaka-san and returned as my enemy!

195
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,800
You have no clue how I feel!

196
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,680
Oh, they're fighting!

197
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,220
Don't!

198
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,720
Of course I would!

199
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,730
Ippon!

200
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,480
This time she won in eight seconds!

201
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,110
Honami Sayaka's not only strong, she's all powerful!

202
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,820
That pompous little brat!

203
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,870
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,040
Hey, do you want to do something?

205
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,870
The weather is nice, and it's a Sunday.

206
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,880
Let's go! The weather's too nice to go to the movies!

207
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,570
I gotta do something.</i>

208
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,580


209
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,400
If I don't, Yawara will really quit judo for good.</i>

210
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,320
But, what should I do?</i>





211
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,620
How the hell can I...</i>

212
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,880
She's like quicksilver!

213
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Honami's judo is going at breathtaking speed!

214
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,380
Throw her down!

215
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,220
It's the 48 kg-and-unders, and her opponent, Okubo,

216
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,060
is completely overwhelmed by her torrential combination of moves!

217
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,970
Ippon! Done!

218
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
She's the champ!

219
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,240
Honami Sayaka won the 48 kg-and-unders, entirely with Ippons!


220
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,320
Indeed! If Inokuma Yawara had actually come to this tournament,

221
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,620
how would that fateful showdown have turned out?

222
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,830
Honami Sayaka has made a true comeback!

223
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,340
Anchor desk! Anchor desk! I'm here with the victor, Honami Sayaka.

224
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,310
Congratulations! That was a stunning triumph!

225
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,840
Of course it was!

226
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Way to go, my lady!

227
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
You're the real queen!

228
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,310
S-So, now that you won a trip to Barcelona...

229
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,440
A trip to Barcelona?

230
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,570
Please, I've already made countless trips to that city.

231
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,860
I even have a villa there,

232
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,110
so even without your cheap ticket,

233
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,150
I can go there first-class whenever I want.

234
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:46,120
A-Actually, I meant to say you just qualified for the World Judo Championships.

235
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,110
The World Judo Championships?



236
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,670
Is that so? I had no idea!

237
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,100
I couldn't care less about it!

238
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,590
Huh?

239
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,200
Where's the camera?

240
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,390
Oh, here?

241
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,220
Now zoom in close.

242
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,060
No, even closer!

243
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,310
Inokuma Yawara-san, stop being timid and show yourself!

244
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,150
Fight me fair and square so I can end your reign of glory in front of everyone!


245
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,820
You tell her!

246
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,870
Are you kidding? You'll never be a match for Inokuma-san!

247
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,740
They let her run her mouth off the whole time!

248
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,080
B-Back to you, anchor desk!

249
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,040
That was intense!

250
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,050
Honami just launched a direct challenge to Inokuma!

251
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,930
That might be the Honami we know, but this time it's different!


252
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,220
She issued that challenge just now with complete confidence!

253
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:48,480
It's no exaggeration to say that she's now good enough to defeat Inokuma.


254
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,370
We can't wait to see how she performs at the Barcelona World Judo Championships!

255
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,450
Eii!

256
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,670
I've had tempura rice, cream anmitsu, red bean soup, jelly strips, and fruit parfaits!

257
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,340
I've had my fill, but I'm still hungry! This stinks!

258
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,300
Master!

259
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,720
This is all thanks to that idiot, no-good office girl Yawara losing by default!

260
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,680
Master!

261
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,770
What's that yer holding?





262
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,180
Huh?

263
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,230
That flaky thing you're holding! Is that a wonton?

264
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,560
This? It's just a crepe!

265
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,150
Are they good? Where'dja get them, huh?

266
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,820
Master?!

267
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,200
Master Inokuma!

268
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,450
Where did you go?!

269
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,290
Welcome, sir, what will you have?

270
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,540
Hm, seems to be a hodgepodge written up there.

271
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,490
I'll have a chocolate-banana crepe!

272
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,420
Thanks for waiting! Here are your chocolate-banana crepes.

273
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,910
It's been a dog's age.

274
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,900
I get it. It's all clear to me now.

275
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,770
So that's what's eating you, Yawara?

276
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,970
Thanks a lot! I had a lot of fun!

277
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,970
S-Sure.

278
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,470
I'll see you again.

279
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,470
U-Um...

280
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,640
Or maybe I won't.

281
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,520
Matsuda-san, you've been chasing me so you could write articles about my judo career.

282
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,150
But after I quit judo, you won't need to anymore.



283
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,440
W-Wait, what are you—

284
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,900
Bye.

285
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,220
Ah, hey! W-Wait!

286
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,840
So long.

287
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,450
But I—

288
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,380
So you find it that hard to fight your dad, eh?

289
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,380
Oh, I know everything!

290
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,220
There ain't no one else on God's green earth who could train Miss Sayaka that good!

291
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,980
You weak, soft-headed namby-pamby!

292
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,860
Hear this, Yawara! Put up them earflaps and listen up!

293
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,570
Don't say it.


294
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,280
Oh, I dang well will!

295
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,030
Don't tell Mom!

296
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,950
She'll be heartbroken.

297
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,500
What will I do now?

298
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:59,980
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 33 Days#

299
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,900
Squid-ink risotto, paella, and Barcelona can all go jump in a lake!

300
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,030
Dad...



301
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:13,410
Thanks to that stupid, lily-livered office girl, the World Championships were a total dud!

302
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,160
Honami Sayaka can go jump in a lake!

303
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,410
If I quit judo, will I ever see Matsuda-san again?

304
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,370
Yawara!

305
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,920
The World's Greatest Heiress.

306
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,930
m 0 0 l 21 0 l 21 14 l 5 14 l 5 25 l -24 25 l -24 14 l -39 14 l -39 0

307
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,930
The World's Greatest Heiress

308
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,540
You'll be getting my Uchi Mata if you don't watch!
