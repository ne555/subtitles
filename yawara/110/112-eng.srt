How are you feeling, Fujiko-san?

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,930
I'm over my morning sickness, and now I feel great!

5
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,310
I also have a huge appetite. I'm practically eating six meals a day!

6
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,950
It looks like you're beginning to show.

7
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,910
This is a crucial period, so you need to take care of yourself, Fujiko-san.


8
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm fine, I'm fine! Playing judo trained my body well.

Don't worry about it.

Yeah, Grandpa is very excited about it.

Good luck with your company judo team and with the All-Japan Selected, Inokuma-san.

Thanks. I'll give it my all.

Our kid is also cheering for you. It's even starting to move.

It's kicking inside of me like it can't wait to come out.

Really?




27
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,910
Whenever Hanazono-san presses his ear against my stomach and hears it kick,

28
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,090
he screams, "All right! Time to give it my all!"

Besides, my you-know-who has gotten like this.

Hey, little baby, your papa already bought you a baby bed!

There you go again! Things must be going well with Matsuda-san, right?

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,730
So, um...

173
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,890
I get it, Yawara-san.

174
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,380
I'll take you to a famous OB/GYN clinic that I know well.

175
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,980
We'll talk there.

176
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,440
Huh? You know such a great clinic, Kazamatsuri-san?

177
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,990
That works out for me!

178
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,330
You're taking this way too lightly, Yawara-san.</i>

179
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,830
I'm sure Fujiko-san will be glad to get that referral!

180
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,540
Fujiko-san?

181
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,050
Yes. Didn't anyone tell you the good news about Fujiko-san?

182
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,380
Mommy, buy me a cake!

183
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,450
No, you eat too much sugar!

184
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,050
No, buy me cake!

185
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,640
No!

186
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,940
Is that so? Fujiko-san went to the hospital because she ate too much?

187
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,880
Is that right? I thought it was you—

188
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,840
Forget what I said.



189
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,250
That's still amazing, Kazamatsuri-san. You must know a whole lot of people.

190
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,830
Oh, that's mainly because I frequently...

191
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,980
Forget about me. What did you want to talk about today?

192
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,160
Um...

193
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,170
Did Sayaka-san come back from Paris?

194
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,840
Y-Yes.

195
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,700
I believe she did, a few days ago, but I don't know much about it.

196
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,300
I knew it.



197
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,850
You already knew? How did you know about that in advance?

198
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,610
Well...

199
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,710
First-class seats leaving Paris, correct?

200
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,820
Although it's hardly worth showing to you viewers,

201
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,450
this banquet hall can only hold 2,000 people.



202
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,580
This is our little study that holds first editions from around the world.

203
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,580
This bedroom must seem quite quaint when compared to me.

204
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,340
This is my pets' room. Aren't they all cute little things?

205
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,710
Uh, yeah...

206
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,330
Aren't they cute?

207
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,340
Yes!

208
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,150
This is but one tenth of our entire mansion.

209
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,350
It must be more cozy than you think.

210
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,970
N-No, this is the very definition of a stately mansion.

211
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,350
There must be nothing else you could possibly want.

212
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,300
That's right!

213
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,570
Except for one thing.

214
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,510
Inokuma Yawara, I will defeat you and stand at the summit of women's judo.

215
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,820
That is my ultimate desire.

216
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,870
One year ago, I would have been the victor at the All-Japan Tournament,

217
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,310
if it hadn't been for your completely fortuitous move.

218
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,840
However, such flukes will no longer work against me.

219
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,170
I traveled all over Europe on a dojo challenge tour, starting in France.

220
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,260
You will see the results of my endeavors the hard way,

221
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,850
on July 8th,

222
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,850
at the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships!






223
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,350
Wow... This is huge!

224
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,810
Now this is getting interesting!

225
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,070
Uh, what did you just say?

226
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:33,120
It's just... What if, maybe... Sayaka-san's coach...

227
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,330
Could he possibly be my father, Inokuma Kojiro?

228
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,650
Wh-What are you saying, Yawara-san?

229
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,970
M-My gosh, what made you think that?

230
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,390
On the passenger list, I saw the names "S. Honami" and "K. Inokuma."

231
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,700
N-Now wait, it could be "Honami Shikanosuke" and "Inokuma Kemeko," for all we know.

232
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,350
Yeah...

233
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,340
Please believe me. I'm her coach, you know.

234
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,100
I've never seen or heard from your father!

235
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,650
I-It's true. Honest!



236
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,820
The television broadcast must be over.</i>

237
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,200
Forgive me, Yawara-san. I need to return to work.

238
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,990
I'm sorry for bothering you when you're busy.

239
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,590
Cheer up, Yawara-san. You're just over-thinking the situation.

240
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,490
You mustn't worry about those things.

241
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,760
You have the All-Japan Selected coming up.

242
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,510
I'm always here for you if you want.

243
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,590
Thanks.




244
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,020
O-Oh, my God! Yawara-san knows!

245
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,980
I'm home!

246
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,970
Hey, Yawara! Where didja wander off to?

247
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,600
I got something to show you! Get in here and have a seat.

248
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,530
You can watch your dirty videos alone!

249
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,990
This is a lot more provocative than those videos!

250
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,010
Honami Sayaka-san! A comment, please!

251
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,110
Please!
Honami Sayaka-san! A comment, please!

252
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,270

Please!

253
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,310
Tell us more about your dojo challenge tour!

254
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,350
Come on, you had a lot to say on TV, didn't you?!

255
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,940
Screw this.

256
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,010
Come on, just a word!

257

Kazamatsuri!

259
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,250
I must've been crazy thinking it was you.

260
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,900
What the hell are you mumbling?!

261
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,440
Anyway, how does Honami Sayaka look?

262
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,480
How much stronger has she become?!

263
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
There's no time for that.

264
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,070
Wh-What do you mean?

265
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,800
Yawara-san's found out about her father's dealings?!

266
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,580
Not so loud.

267
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,270
I told her she was over-thinking the situation,

268
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,080
but it's only a matter of time before she discovers the whole truth.

269
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,620
What are you saying?

270
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,590
If she finds out about her dad, Yawara-san might really quit judo this time!

271
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,680
Agreed.

272
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,550
That's why you must watch yourself around her, Matsuda-san.

273
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,060
Wha... Hey, Kazamatsuri!

274
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,650
Inokuma Yawara, I will defeat you and stand at the summit of women's judo.

275
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,570

H-Hey, it's about to get good!

281
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,050
However—

Okay!

285
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,780
Good grief, I can't write an article about this.

286
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,870
Inokuma-san, why don't you start your own practice?

287
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,330
Give us a front-page photo!

You remember I told you about your father's favorite oden shop, below a bridge in Kanda?

302

I heard that someone who looks like your father has been spotted there!

So I went to inquire about it, and what do you know?
