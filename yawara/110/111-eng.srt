00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,760
She crushes France's DuPont in the 61kg-and-unders,

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,540
winning the Fukuoka International Women's Judo Tournament!

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,000
There goes Inokuma!

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,470
She slams Bridges of the UK with a beautiful Ippon Zeoi, winning the 48kg-and-unders!

9
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,510
Japanese women's judo has gotten more exciting, folks!

10
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,980

Indeed!



16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,040
Ito's rapid improvement has given women's judo a shot in the arm!

17
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,200
Don't be so optimistic!

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,380
Beanpole ain't practicing because of a cold? That just means she's slacking off!

19
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,980
Yes, but we're very circumspect with our players' health.

20
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,900
Once she comes back to practice, she's retraining from the basics!

21
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,640
And be a lot tougher on her this time!

22
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,620
Yes, sir! Ito will perform brilliantly at the All-Japan Championships!

23
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,650
She will then go to the Barcelona Olympics with Yawara-san!






24
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,220
Mm-hmm! And those two'll snatch them gold medals!

29

That's strange.

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,270
They told me she was home with a cold when I called Saikai U.

31
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,280
Maybe I should get some tea and wait by the station.

32
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,250
Fujiko-san!

33
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,960
Inokuma-san!

34
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,960
You shouldn't be here if you have a cold.

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't have a cold.

36
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,470
Oh? Then why did you miss practice?

37
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,980
Inokuma-san, I might not be able to enter the All-Japan Tournament.

38
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,380
Huh?

39
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,670
Why? Are you injured?





40
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,020
I see. You must not like judo anymore.

41
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,530
I understand. How can a girl like a sweaty combat sport anyway?

42
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,000
Th-That's not it! I love judo!

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,980
Then why?

44
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,410
You were so into it! And you're at the top of your game right now.

45
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,180
Fujiko-san, if something is bothering you, tell me!

46
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,390
I'll do anything I can to help!

For what?

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,290
You know.

52
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,000
Sorry, what?

53

Fujiko-san, what did they say?

Fujiko-san!

61
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,200
Fujiko-san, what did your doctor say?

62
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,040
He said October 10th!

63
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,460
That's when it's due!


64
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,970
All right, I'm going to do it!

65
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,060
I'm going to give birth to a kid as full of life as Inokuma-san!

66
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,180
Fujiko-san!


67
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,210
I made up my mind when the doctor congratulated me!

Congratulations, Fujiko-san!

71
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,090
The All-Japan Tournament is almost here.

72
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,470
We'll probably see you and Inokuma-san in the finals, like last year.

73
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,290
This time I'll be there to cheer you on.

74
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,480
Still, I'm not going to just sit back and cheer.

75
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,690
I'll also be working full throttle toward the Barcelona Olympics.

76
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,110
Hanazono-san... do you like children?

77
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,240
Of course!

78
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,490
The kids who live around my judo dorm have become attached to me.

79
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,830
Every day, I throw them and knock them down, and we all have fun!





80
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,420
You have big hands.

81
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,380
Putting babies into baths is a job reserved for daddies with big hands.

82
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,050
I could put quintuplets or sextuplets in the bath with my hands!

83
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,890
Good luck, Papa.

84
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,850
Papa, huh?

85
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:22,810
If we do have a baby, we'll make it practice judo by the time it walks,

86
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,230
and it will become a world champion like Inokuma... or not.





87
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,940
I thought about that as well!

88
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,280

You two are my masters and made me into the judo player I am today,

108
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,740

You may not wanna talk, but I do!

180
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,720
Get Yawara-san out here!

181
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,180
Yawara's prohibited from seeing men!

182
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,640
She's on complete lockdown until the Olympics.

183
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,470
Now get lost!

184
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,940
That's not why I'm here!

185
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,730
This is important! Call Yawara-san—

186
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,070
Grandpa, what do you want for lunch?

187
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,980
Matsuda-san!

188
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,990
Yawara-san, is it true that Fujiko-san is pregnant?

189
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,080
I have no idea what you're talking about.

190

192
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,140
So it's true!

193
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,920
No, um...

194
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,250
It's about to blow up.

195
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,250
It'll be revealed in tomorrow's <i>Sports Tokyo</i> !

198
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,180
Is Ito Fujiko-san in there?

199

You can send out Yawara-san! Please give us a comment!

200

What's the racket so danged early?!

201

Gah, it's her grandpa!

202
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,320
It's an honor to see you. May we have a word?



203
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,360
Oh, you wanna hear the heroic saga of my youth?

204
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,600
It was back during the February 26th Incident of '36.



205
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,540
Dark clouds were looming all over the globe at the time...

206
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,920
E-Excuse me, but we've heard that story three times already.

207
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,600
Good, then I'll switch over to my roaring post-war years then!

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,960
We're not here for that!

209
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,220
We're here about Ito Fujiko's pregnancy that <i>Sports Tokyo</i> scooped us on!

210
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,850
What do you say about that article?

211
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,310
Is it true? Who's the father?

212
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,330
How do you feel about your prized pupil becoming pregnant?





213
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,690
She's pregnant, so what's done is done.

214
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,340
But she's our hope for the Barcelona Olympics. You trained her yourself!

215
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,700
You're down one Olympic medal hopeful!

216
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,580
Grow the hell up, and quit making such a damn fuss over this!

217
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,540
My Yawara will win the medals Beanpole should've!

218
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,780
Wait a second! Inokuma-san!

219
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,780
Are you hiding Ito Fujiko in your residence?!

220
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,550
Send her out if she's in there!

221
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,050
Sheesh, she'd better thank me.

222
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,770
What will you do from here on out?

223
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,400
I intend to marry her and work for our child.

224
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,400
I see.

225
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Good luck! Show 'em what a man can do.

226
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,810
I will.

227
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,030
Don't worry about Fujiko-san.

228
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,160
She's hiding out at Yawara-san's place.






229
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,330
Jigoro-san and Yawara-san will figure something out.

230
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,210
The media must have Yawara-san's place completely surrounded by now.

231
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,730
I'm going to be a man!

232
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,350
I'm responsible for all of this! I can't make any more trouble for others.

233
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,850
Also, I'll be the one to protect Fujiko-san!

234
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,810
Hey, Hanazono!


235
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,860
There you have it.

236
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,540
Ito Fujiko-san has not returned to her apartment,

237
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,920
and we have yet to locate her.

238
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,830
Rumor has it that she's hiding out here at the residence of Inokuma Jigoro, her instructor.

239
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,320
Because she's an Olympic gold medal hopeful,

240
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,290
we highly anticipate her next move in this developing scandal.

258

Are you going to register as a family?

What's your comment as her friend?!

269
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,870
There's a chance this might happen to you too, right?

270

Stop!




276

277
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,800
P-Please, stop!

278
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,270
Y-Yes, we were careless.

279
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,820
We made trouble for
 Master Jigoro, Coach Yutenji,

280
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,820
and everyone else who has helped us.

289
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,780
to be as cheerful, strong, and gentle as Inokuma-san.

290

We'll raise a strong child

291

292

So...

293
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,630
So I'll score an Ippon in giving birth and raising this child!
