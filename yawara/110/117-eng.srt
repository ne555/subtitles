2
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,500
God! What are you thinking, Kosaku?

3
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,510
We didn't even get a chance to discuss our future with your father!


4
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,490
Hey, are you even listening? Matsuda Kosaku!

5
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,570
Why did you think I followed you all the way to Yamagata?

6
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,610
When you left, didn't you say you'd become the best sports reporter in Japan?!

7
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,400
Were you just bluffing?

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,280
You'd best finish what you started!

9
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,080
If you can't do that, then give back the money I gave you for Yugoslavia!

10
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
Give it back now!

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,750
What happened to the drive you had back then?!



12
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,040
Yugoslavia...</i>

13
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,160
Matsuda-san, you've been chasing me so you could write articles about my judo career.

14
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,340
But after I quit judo, you won't need to anymore.

15
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,630
Wait, what are you—

16
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,380
Bye.

17
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,260
Ah, hey! W-Wait!

18
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,880
So long!



19
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,250
It wasn't just the judo.</i>

20
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,810
I've been chasing after Yawara-san because she shines when she plays judo.</i>

21
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,180
And now she's...</i>


22
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,310
Kuni-chan ain't gonna quit,
 no matter what obstacles there are!

23
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,320
That's 'cause we're connected by the red string of fate!

24
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,110
Right, Kosaku?

25
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,330
Aw, you didn't have to go to the bathroom just when we were getting into it!


26
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,500
Kosaku, you jerk!

27
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,340
Hello, Matsuda speaking.

28
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,680
What? All Sports ? What do you want?!

29
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,510
Uh, what's Yawara-san doing?

That scatterbrain ain't back yet!
 Prolly off gallivanting someplace.

31
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,770
So what is it? If you want a story, I'll give you one!

32
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,280
Oh, I'm not actually looking for a story.

33
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,820
Dummy! What kinda reporter calls not looking for a story?


34
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,240
Lately you've been plastering your front pages with Miss Sayaka!


35
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,910
You can't even find the "I" in "Inokuma" in any of the papers no more!



36
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,830
Why don't you all cover us for once?!

37
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,210
That's why the people you work for will always be a third-rate paper!

38
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,840
If you want Yawara-san back on the front page, she needs to make a comeback!

39
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,600
And that's when you asked Beanpole for a favor, eh?


40
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,470
Keep your nose outta it!

41
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,850
Just leave everything to me!

42
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm just about to launch a decisive second offensive!

43
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,480
It's only a matter of time before she comes back!

44
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,480
But, Jigoro-san...

45
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,990
Beanpole's also back in training! 
You don't need to worry about nothing!

46
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,950
Wait, Jigoro-san!

47
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,090
I'll try again.</i>

48

Hey, Inokuma-san! Let's go somewhere!

My grandpa gets on my case if I'm late.

But you won't enjoy your life as an office lady!

I get it. You have a date!

No, I don't.

Is that Inokuma-san's boyfriend?

Yeah, come on!

W-We need to talk!

I have nothing to say to you.

Please, j-just give me a minute! Hear me out!

I'm going somewhere with my friends!

I get it. He won't take no for an answer.

If today won't work for you, maybe tomorrow?

68
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,320
She'll hate your guts if you don't learn how to stop.

You're quitting, aren't you?

73
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,750
Matsuda-san, if you're quitting your reporting job, then why should you care anymore?

74
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,880
Well, I have thought about it, but...

75
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,260
Yawara-san!

76
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,140
She's going to despise you, you know.

77
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,480
It's not what you think!

78
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,310
Give it up! You must've put her though a lot!

Please, give this to her!

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,530
I'll take it, but I'm not promising anything.

81
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,620
How did she know?

82
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,040
I mean, I have thought about quitting, but I haven't told anyone!


83
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,410
I hate clingy men!

84

I know! Like the ones who think they own you after one quickie!

85
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,090
Even my daddy says so!

He says if Kosaku marries me, he might take over the business one day.

87
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,510
Kosaku's also into that idea.
 He might quit All Sports News real soon.

Besides, Christmas Eve is the night you spend with your main squeeze!

Yup. I know you must've set up a date for tomorrow.

Clingy guys are never smooth when they need to be.

Especially if you already have a date with your sweetheart.

93

So what do you have planned with your main guy?

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,500
Did you reserve a hotel room?

What am I supposed to do with these? Don't mess up my room!


102
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,790
You're to look through 'em and think about your actions!

103
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,500
Especially how your latest shenanigans are not only affecting the 120 million Japanese,

The whole world expects a whole lot from you,

00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,590
yet you do diddly squat to meet those expectations!


108
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,890
Now look through them, and think about that!

109
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,640

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,340
I received a call from one of your father's friends.

175
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,710
He said he saw your father at a yakitori place in Shimokitazawa.

176
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,050
I'll have to go there first thing tomorrow morning.

177
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,010
What's wrong, Yawara?

178
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,810
Aren't you lonely, Mom?

179
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,520
Don't you hate judo for taking Dad away from you?

180
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,030
Eating a Christmas cake together, going on trips, laughing and crying together...

181
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,530
That's what a normal family does.

182
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,030
I don't feel lonely at all.

183
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,120
We're a family, no matter how far apart we are.

184
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,370
There are families who see each other every day but never understand each other.

185
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,670
There are also families who live apart yet understand each other well.





186
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,950
So that means you understand Dad?

187
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,970
Well, I'm not sure if I fully understand him.

188
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,690
Your father's passion for judo burns brighter than anyone else's.

189
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,980
I knew that full well before I married him.

190
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,900
Of course, we couldn't live together as a normal family,

191
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,030
but for every day I don't see him, I still root for him.

192
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,280
But Dad...

193
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,160
I'm sure your father is watching over us. Believe me, I know.

194
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,170
People can understand each other, even without words or phrases.





195
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,880
Mom...

196
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,930
What? You're acting like a kid!

197
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,060
I'm sure one day you'll meet someone who will watch over you,

198
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,940
however clumsily he does it.

199
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,020
You might already know him!

200
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,400
Uh, oh! I'm forgetting your grandfather's favorite chicken and vegetable stew!

201
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,490
You'd better hurry up and get ready, Yawara.

202
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,660
Okay.

203
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,410
Matchbook: Café Titicaca#

204
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,420
I'll be waiting here tomorrow after you get off work!

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
Sign: Café Titicaca#

206
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,270
He doesn't matter!




207
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,600
That's right. I don't care about Matsuda-san.

208
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,440
Ouch!

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,440
I thought I got rid of them, but Grandpa must've put them there again!

210
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,450
Article: Matsuda Kosaku#

211
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,970
It's the article from Yugoslavia.</i>

212
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,070
Inokuma Yawara's Ippon Zeoi even gave...

213
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,970
...a middle-aged Yugoslavian taxi driver a huge thrill.

214
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,740
That man was a big fan of Inokuma Yawara.

215
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,980
He's probably praising Inokuma Yawara's victory in the land beneath the distant skies.

216
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,440
Matsuda Kosaku.

217
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,200
Inokuma Yawara miraculously defeats five in a row!





218
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,570
As Inokuma's heart filled with the longings of her Mitsuba teammates,

219
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,450
she threw, tossed, and slammed her way to victory!

220
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Sign: Matsuda Kosaku#

221
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,060
Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi!


222
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,020
Inokuma threw her!

223
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,560
Inokuma goes for an Ippon Zeoi!

224
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,060
Inokuma's thundering, lightning-fast Ippon Zeoi!

225
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,330
At that moment, you could hear a pin drop among the spectators.

226
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,490
They had no idea what had just happened.


227
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,530
It was that flawless an Ippon Zeoi.

228
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,280
You could even say it was a work of art.

229
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,580
With this, Inokuma takes one more step toward the gold in Barcelona.

230
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,380
It's snowing.

231
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,090
A white Christmas, huh?

232
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,970
A white Christmas together with Yawara-san.

233
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,550
What a refined present from Santa Claus.

234
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,390
Hey, this is his fifth refill!

235
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,020
He's been stood up!


236
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,980
Look at what he has on the table!

237
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,740
Where does this small, petite girl store all her strength?

238
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,710
Perhaps it's only this reporter who refuses to believe his eyes.

239
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,070
All he can do is call her a prodigy.

240
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,000
No. Inokuma Yawara outshines even the greatest prodigies!




241
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,170
That's why she's able to make us ordinary folks so passionate!

242
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,340
No matter what challenges we face,
 she'll always toss them with an Ippon Zeoi...

243
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,920
for all of us!

244
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,050
No, she tosses them together with us.

245
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,800
Matsuda Kosaku.

246
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,150
People can understand each other, even without words or phrases.

247
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,070
I'm sure one day you'll meet someone who will watch over you.




248
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,570
What do you care about Christmas?!

249
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,740
We can just sit home and eat two or three cakes!

250
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,450
But here you are flouncing off somewhere for some confabbed reason!

251
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,040
Hey, I'm talking to you here!

252
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,540
Hello?



253
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I'm sorry. I can't make it tonight.

254
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,920
It's something out of my control. I'm sorry.

255
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,920
So you're finally ready to start practicing?

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,430
I-It's fine, don't worry about it!

257
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,470
We can always get together whenever you feel like it.

258
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,430
I hope to see you again.

259
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,320
Dry martini.

260
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,820
Dry. Martini.

261
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,490
Matsuda-san, I heard the cheers!</i>

262
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,750
I heard the cheers from your articles!</i>

263
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,420
For so long you've always... you've always watched over me.</i>

264
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,930
What should I do?</i>

265
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,930
What should I do? Matsuda-san's...</i>


266
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,640
Matsuda-san's going to quit!</i>

267
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,020
Excuse me.

268
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,280
We're about to close.

269
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,370
Please, you have to hurry!

270
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,790
I can't. Look around you!

271
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,330
Can't you do something?

272
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,790
There's nothing I can do unless you expect me to fly through the air.

273
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,800
You can thank the snow for this.

274
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,170
Matsuda-san!</i>

275
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,380
Dry martini.

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,260
Huh?

277
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,510
Dry martini!

Just give me a little more time. I'll get you your article.

Matsuda-san! Don't quit being a reporter!

290
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,000
Of course I won't!

291
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,920
I'll...

ten times more training you've been getting before!
