00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,700
Another flamboyant performance!

2
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,580
Maybe it's because of her stunning moves, but she's completely won over the Spanish crowd!

3
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,120
On her way to the 48 kg-and-under championship match,

4
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,040
Japan's Honami Sayaka has won all her matches with Ippons!

5
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,460
You mustn't!

6
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,840
What if that kid throws Hanazono-kun as a result?

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,100
Hanazono-kun will go off on a journey to train himself, tearing the family apart!

8
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,360
And what if he becomes her rival's coach just to defeat her?

9
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,940
No way!

10
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,280
A-Are you saying that your dad is Honami Sayaka's...

11
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,870
Ippon!






12
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,700
She won!

13
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,290
She's strong!

14
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,330
Honami Sayaka is now literally the queen sitting on the world throne!

15
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,340

This is the age of Honami Sayaka!

18
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,600
And thanks to her, it's now the age of All Sports News !

19
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,730
No other cameraman from around the world could get a good photo of Honami's speedy judo.

20
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,320
But take a look at this one!


21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,110
Because of it, our paper sold like hotcakes that day!

22
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,580
We kicked our rival Oshiuri Sports right in the tail. We're now fourth in sales!

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,450
So there you have it.

24
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,790
In recognition of this achievement, here's the Editor's Award bonus!

25
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,710
Thank you!




26
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,880
You've become really good, Kuni-chan!

27
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,550
So now you have both looks and talent?

28
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,300
Oh, gosh! You're so right!

29
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:29,560
That photo resulted from combining my talents with Sayaka's to make magic!


30
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,440
You're just full of surprises, aren't you?

31
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,770
Yay!

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,270
You're one to talk.</i>

33
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,530
You just accidentally pressed the shutter while looking away.</i>


34
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:46,120
Nonetheless, I don't think a woman can discover her talents on her own!


35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,620
Still shoveling it?</i>

36
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,990
She needs...

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,870
a wonderful partner!

38
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,250
Hey! Lemme go!

39
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,840
Way to go, you two!

40
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,630
When are you gonna get hitched?

41
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,760
Nobody's getting hitched! Quit imagining things!

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,510
If only your "wonderful partner" wrote fresher articles, we'd sell even more!

43
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,560
But you're always hung up on Inokuma Yawara.


44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,850
I thought she'd quit judo or something.

45
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,900
Inokuma Yawara's no good for us!

46
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,480
From now on, it's all about Honami! Honami!


47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,700
Kuni-chan, let's take that bonus and have a party!

48
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,860
Sounds great!

49
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,160
No can do! This is for my date with Kosaku!

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,580
Right, Kosaku?

51
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,160
Why is it always him?

Like hell she's not!

56
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,310
Where did Kosaku run off to?


57
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,480
I wanted to celebrate this happy day together!

58
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,900
But... he's right this time. Yawara-san will quit judo.</i>

59
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,490
The idea of her winning in Barcelona will remain a fantasy.</i>

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,160
And all I can do... All I can do is suck my thumb and watch?</i>

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,480
Geez, Louise.

71
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
He doesn't know when to give up.

72
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,490
Doesn't he know he has a hot girl like me right in front of him?


73
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,870
But the Yawara-chan craze is over.

74
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,500
It's only a matter of time before Kosaku wakes up.

75
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,500
Yawara-chan!


76
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, no! Oh, no!

77
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,130
Yawara-chan, it's been ages! How are you doing?

78
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,050
What a coincidence. I'm glad I caught you here.

79
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,550
Kuniko-san...

80
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,810
Is there a cafe around here? I'm thirsty, and I need to use the restroom!

81
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,390
Let's go to a cafe! Let's go!


82
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,430
U-Um, I have to get dinner ready.

83
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,950
The media hounds were after you all the time. That must've been difficult!

84
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,030
Yeah.


85
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,040
But aren't you glad that things have finally cooled off?

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Yes, thank goodness.

87
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,170
We have Sayaka-san to thank for that.

88
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,550
Public attention can be really fickle.

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,060
Yeah.

90
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,800
Kosaku must've been pestering you, right?

91
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,800
Matsuda-san?

92
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,350
I'm sorry Kosaku always kept after you.

93
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,330
But don't you fret.

94
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,270
He'll never show himself around you again.

95
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:08,780
I mean, seriously, he's not going to get any articles if he follows you now!

96
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,240
Right.


97
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,830
Oh my, is that true?

You travel agents have it hard!

99
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,050
But we all have it tough.
 My workplace is always busy.

100
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,880
And they practically pay us in peanuts!

101
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,640
That's why Daddy is going to ask Kosaku to quit that third-rate paper and marry me.


102
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,850
Oh, my daddy owns and operates a little company called "Healthy Land Kaga."

103
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:49,650
I'm his only daughter, and if Kosaku marries me, he might take over it one day.



104
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,370
Kosaku's also into that idea. He might quit All Sports News real soon.


105

I hope you find happiness too, Yawara-chan. Kosaku and I are rooting for you.

Sorry, I really have to get home.

107
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,460

It's about Inokuma, isn't it?

175
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,540
Inokuma-san might actually quit judo.

176
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,250
Coming! If it's a newspaper subscription, we already have oneâ€”

177
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,590
Hey!

178
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,050
Matsuda-san!

179
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,510
Is Fujiko-san here?

180
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,640
I thought you'd give birth in your home town.

181
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,060
Yeah, but the doctor I have here is terrific,

182
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,650
and I've been doing great ever since I got over my morning sickness.

183
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,650
Y-Yeah, um... the truth is...

184
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,950
What is it, Matsuda-san?

185
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,950
This is good tea!

186
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,750
It came from Fujiko-san's home town of Shizuoka!

187
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,540
Shizuoka has the best of everything: teas, Mt. Fuji, and women!


188
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,460
Cut that out, Hanazono-san!

189
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,180
Matsuda-san...

190
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,220
It's about Inokuma-san, isn't it?

191
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,560
I have a favor to ask you.

It's already October. Three more months and it's the New Year.

196

Of course.

Next year is the Olympics.

198
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:47,880
But it makes me sad to think that both
 Yawara-san and Ito Fujiko might miss them!

199
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,470
Miss Sayaka can enliven the whole world just fine without those two.

200

Quit mumbling and eat!
 This is double-decker eel here!

Master, you're unbelievably calm!

202
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,860
Yawara-san's rival, Honami, is making a huge splash! Aren't you mortified?


203
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,240
Feh, let her act like a queen all she wants to.

204
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,120
I'll slap her down to size soon enough.

So you say, but Yawara-san has practically retired!

206
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,880
All your attempts to persuade her have failed, but now...

207
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,510
Hey, if you ain't gonna eat, I'll take that!


208
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,540
Hey, wait a minute, Master!

209
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,060
Let go, dang it!

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,390
Leggo!

What did you say?

212
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,460
I've thought about it a lot.

213
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,320
It's all I think about, day or night.

214
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,640
But I still think it's the only hand we can play!

215
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,660
This is to bring Yawara-san back! So please, just this once!

Uh, no... sorry.

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
I guess it's too much to ask.

219
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,930
I never even thought... about what you said.

It's fine. Don't worry about it!

I-I'm sorry. You need to focus on giving birth, Fujiko-san.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,360
I know. Don't kick me!

223
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,740
I've made my child angry.

224
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,910
It's telling me I have to go for it.

Well, the baby has really settled down.

I don't feel like it's ready to pop at all.

What on earth is going on?

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,930
I'm going shopping. Inokuma-san, make yourself at home.

232
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,300
Okay!

233
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,060
But this is October 10th, your due date.

234
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,440
Indeed. I can't just sit around.

235

I have to hurry up and give birth with flying colors, for Inokuma-san's sake as well!

Hanazono-kun, why don't you sit down?

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,790
You're just as amazing as me,
 the guy who thought up this plan!

347
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,800
Actually, Matsuda-san asked me the same thing.

348
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,260
Huh?

349
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,430
So I was prepared to do it even before she was born.

350
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,720
R-Really?

351
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,310
Fortunately, my doctor told me it was an easy birth,

352
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,890
even though I experienced a lot of pain.


353
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,480
She also said I'm recovering amazingly fast.

354
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,230
Mm-hmm, very good.

355
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,490
I don't know how far I'll go,
 but I'll definitely do everything I can!

356
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,950
You know damn well where you're going.
 There's only one goal.

357
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,040
If you come back aiming for the Barcelona Olympics,

358
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,250
that's sure to get Yawara moving again!

359
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,600
Dang that All Sports brat!</i>

360
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,630
He meddled without even telling me, that lousy dummy!</i>

361
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,510
Fukuko-chan.</i>

362
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,930
Root for your mama, Fukuko-chan.</i>

363
00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:00,100
The Barcelona Olympics in 19 Days#


364
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,530
Grandpa! Quit involving Fujiko-san in your schemes to get at me!

365
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,450
Get at you? Quit being so danged conceited!

366
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,080
Beanpole's aiming for Barcelona of her own volition!

367
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,690
This ain't even about you!



368
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,450
Then there's Matsuda-san.
 He's going to quit being a reporter.

369
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,830
I guess I don't matter anymore.

370
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,920
Yawara!

371
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,750
Don't Be Stupid!

372
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,770
You'll be getting my Ude Hishigi Jyuji Gatame if you don't watch!

373
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:30,090
Don't Be Stupid!
