1
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,800
Ouch...

2
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,920
Inokuma-san...

3
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,260
I guess Inokuma-san isn't going to return to judo!

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,310
Inokuma-san!

5
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,170
Fujiko-san, you need to be careful. There are icy patches on this path.

6
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,340
R-Right!

7
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,720
I-Ino... Ino... Inokuma-san?

8
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,060
How many laps are you going to run along this bank?

9
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,970
Ten laps.

10
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,060
That sounds grueling!

11
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,360
But you need to get back into shape, so let's go for it.

12
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,650
Come on, let's run, Fujiko-san!

13
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,950
Okay!

14
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,990
Inokuma-san...

15
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,120
Fujiko-san...

16
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,170
I'm sorry for making you worry for so long.

17
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,480
Okay, let's go!

18
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,730
Fight on!

19
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,770
Yeah!

20
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,870
Sayaka's Top Secret Training

21
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,370
Sign: Inokuma#

22
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,200
Yawara-san!


23
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,750
Where's Yawara-san?

24
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,620
What's with all this noise so early in the morning?

25
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,840
Yawara's already off training.

26
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,470
T-Training? You mean judo training, right?

27
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,720
Of course for judo! She ain't training for sumo.

28
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,250
All... All right!

29
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,480
Get off of me!

30
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,480
Okay, so she finally... I see now!


31
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,230
Say... can I write an article about this?

32
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,240
Of course. Write all you want!

33
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,450
Make sure you give it the first, second, and third page spreads!

34
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,750
And don't forget an article about me!

35
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,040
I put in unflagging efforts to bring Yawara back to judo as a boon for everyone!

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,720
You can always trust me, a judo 10-dan who won eight straight All-Japans, to come through!

37
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,590
Now that I remember, back in '34,

38
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,970
while I was deep in the mountains, I tossed every single bear that came after me!

39
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,480
Hey, ain'tcha gonna let me finish?!

40
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,740
One, two... three!

41
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,030
Inokuma-san?

42
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,990
Yes?

43
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,330
One, two... three!

44
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,410
Can I ask you one question?

45
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,580
What is it?




46
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,340
Is it all right if you play against your father and his pupil, Sayaka-san?

47
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Matsuda-san! Don't quit being a reporter!

48
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,370
Of course I won't!

49
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,450
I'll...

50
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,370
I'll practice judo again!

51
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,270
Excuse me. It's getting cold.

52
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,780
I'm sorry.

53
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,660
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you that!

54
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,700
I-It's okay! We have five more laps left! Let's keep at it!

55
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,920
Inokuma-san... you're still lost.</i>

56
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,170
But...</i>

57
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,430
now you're motivated!</i>

58
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,610
She's serious! She's become seriously motivated!

59
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,320
Go get 'em!

60
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,240
Honami-san, any comment?

61
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,660
Headline: Aiming for Barcelona
Near sidebar: Training with Ito Fujiko
Far sidebar: Yawara on the Move!!#

62
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,660
What do you think of the article in All Sports News ?

63
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,920
Why are you making such a fuss?

64
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,420
It is just a third-rate newspaper informing us that an office worker has started her judo training.

65
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,970
Okay, so that means Queen Sayaka-san won't be giving her a second thought?





66
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,680
That would feed the speculation that you're the clear favorite.

67
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,390
I am way past being the "clear favorite."

68
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,310
Can you elaborate?

69
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,900
It means that Inokuma Yawara's reign is clearly at its end!

70
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,370
She clearly does not realize that she is behind the times.

71
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,540
I really pity Inokuma Yawara-san.

72
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,500
Does she want to go to the Olympics so badly?


73
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,130
Does she pine for attention so much?

74
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,300
I will never understand such self-seeking pettiness.

75
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,050
If she wants to go to Barcelona so badly, I can always buy her a ticket.

76
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,060
However...


77
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:08,900
However, I must slam her on the mat and make her realize who I am, for her own good.

78
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,280
That I am the real Queen.

79
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,280
Faster!

80
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,660
Only fifty more!

81
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,290
This is great!


82
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,420
I'm really pleased!

83
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,670
I was happy that Ito came back, but now I've heard that Yawara-san has come back too!

84
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,300
Will you quit squealing like a schoolgirl? Just write that training schedule!

85
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,680
Oh, right!



86
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,310
Well, she has been absent for a while,

87
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,980
so we'll start her off with some basic conditioning, then work our way...

88
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,940
Whaddaya mean, "work our way"?!

89
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,980
The Olympics are just a stone's throw away!

90
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,030
You'd better get ten of the best Saikai judoka here, right now!



91
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,990
She'll be doing mock matches!

92
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,870
But...

93
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,500
Hey, what's with this hundred uchikomis? You'd better make it 500!

94
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,620
Five...

95
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,750
That's too much for anyone!


96
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,460
That's how I've been training her all along!

97
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,090
We're not done!

98
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,220
Go!

99
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,230
Make a full turn in the air!

100
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,350
Go!

101
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,420
So the prodigy is finally getting serious?

102
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,010
eye catch

103
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,430
Sign: All Sports News#

104
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,640
Matsuda-kun!

105
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,150
That running feature I let you have,

106
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,030
"Yawara's Road to Barcelona," is very popular with the readers!

107
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,860
Really?

108
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,580
Well, we're the only paper spotlighting Inokuma Yawara anyway!


109
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,120
Is that so? I knew people were waiting for her comeback.

110
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,880
Yeah, well, even if she loses, it still matters big time whether she's around!

111
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,920
That's righ—

112
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,840
Chief! What do you mean, "even if she loses"?

113
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,220
I'm saying Honami is that good.

114
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,810
Chief!



115
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,850
It's fine, as long as she sells copies.

116
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,270
I know it says "Road to Barcelona,"

117
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,190
but nobody thinks Inokuma's will beat Honami and actually go there.

118
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,360
Y-You can't be serious!

119
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,120
When I write "Road to Barcelona," that means she'll make it there!

120
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
Inokuma Yawara will definitely—

121
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,410
Yes, very good! Keep playing that up!



122
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,710
We're the only ones saying Inokuma has the advantage.

123
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,250
As long as that sells, I ain't complaining!

124
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,630
That's just fine in my book!

125
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,090
Kosaku!

126
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,100
Let's go grab some lunch! What do you want to eat?

127
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,390
She'll win!

128
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,350
Yes, pork cutlets do sound good!

129
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,350
Note: "Katsu" means both win and pork cutlets.#

130
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,060
Inokuma Yawara will definitely win!

131
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,860
Hey! Kosaku, wait for me!


132
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm going to cover a story!
 Tell them I'll be back by six!

133
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,740
It's starting again!

134
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,500
Why is he so obsessed with Yawara-chan? This is the age of Honami Sayaka!

135
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,960
That was superb! Your technique is flawless, Sayaka-san!

136
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,220
Of course it is!



137
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,550
There is no one who can approach my level!

138
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,190
What do you think you're doing to me?!

139
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,190
Get up!

140
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
It's not fair to surprise me like that!

141
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,700
If you want to spar, then do it head on...

142
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,410
Get up!

143
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,380
Do not take Inokuma Yawara lightly!

144
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,050
She's a prodigy. She's not affected by an absence, you hear me?

145
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,680
That prodigy has now gotten serious. I've seen it with my own two eyes!


146
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,400
And it gave me goose bumps!

147
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,570
Kazamatsuri-kun.

148
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,650
Y-Yes, sir?

149
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,950
We're retraining her from the beginning!

150
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,700
Make sure all journalists are shut out.

151
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,660
We're on lockdown!

152
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,620
O-Of course!

153
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:25,670
...and it is to our regret that we will be refusing any and all news coverage!

154
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,220
"To your regret"? We still don't understand why you're doing this!

155
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,060
That heiress rattles on about things we never even ask about!

156
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,390
It makes no sense to shut us out now!



157
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,980
Is she doing secret training for her match against Inokuma?

158
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,900
No comment!

159
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,610
She acted very calm in the face of Inokuma's comeback,

160
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,990
but she's quite unsettled, isn't she?

161
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,910
No comment!

162
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,560
We need more than that!

163
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
What do you mean, "No comment"?

164
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,600
Bring her out here!



165
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,870
He's serious.

166
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,790
Kojiro-san is serious about this.

167
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,670
What kind of horrifyingly intensive training has he started?

168
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,260
This is ridiculous!


169
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,890
We don't have time for this type of training!

170
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,770
Listen to me!

171
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,020
While I'm stuck with this childish training,

172
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,400
Inokuma Yawara is honing her Ippon Zeoi!

173
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,320
Continue!


174
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,410
I can do all the basic abdominal exercises you want at my gym!

175
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,210
Using this filthy sandbag is so beneath me it's not even funny!

176
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,130
Continue!

177
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:55,180
You're terrified that I will defeat your daughter, who is finally making a comeback.

178
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,310
That's why you're making me do this meaningless training!

179
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,190
Am I right? I am, aren't I? Right on the button!

180
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,360
Continue, if you don't want to lose to Inokuma Yawara!

181
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,280
The weight of that sandbag is only the beginning.

182
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,780
We'll be increasing the weight as you go along!

183
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,710
And nobody said you can take it slow and easy on those sandbags.





184
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,000
We have a lot more training to do after them.

185
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,630
There's no time to spare.

186
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,760
You're not performing at a school arts festival, you know!

187
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,390
Kojiro-san.</i>

188
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,230
What do you plan to put Sayaka-san through?</i>

189
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,110
Tell me, what?</i>

190
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,610
Inokuma-san!

191
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,740
Yawara-san!

192
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,950
Give us a comment!


193
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,750
Pipe down, you dummies!

194
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,500
What?

195
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,060
I finally got her to sleep, so keep it down!

196
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,170
That's Ito Fujiko's baby!

197
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,220
If Fuku-chan is here, then that means Fujiko-san came here to train?

198
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,550
Yeah.



199
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,730
The way the kid was always eating, pooping, or crying was interfering with her practice.

200
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,690
Huh, so he's a babysitter?

201
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,240
So Honami's on lockdown, and he's babysitting. There are no articles to write!

202
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,990
What? Lockdown?

203
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:43,120
Yes. It appears they aren't taking it easy, now that Yawara-san's back.

204
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,250
They're not allowing any news coverage.




205
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,500
There, there!

206
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,180
No matter what Miss Sayaka's coach does, he's still number two in the world.

207
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,850
There's no way my son Kojiro can match me, the number one—

208
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,020
Huh?

209
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,190
The media still doesn't know about that!

210
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,320
If you let it slip, you'll create another firestorm!

211
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,610
Oh, is that right?

212
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,900
What was that?

213
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,360
I couldn't hear over the baby's crying!

214
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,080
Oh, it's nothing at all, right?

215
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,750
Hey, Master Jigoro, you're still allowing reporters, aren't you?

216
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,580
Let us see Yawara-san practice!

217
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,340
Sure, go right ahead!

218
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,470
Yawara-san!



219
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,010
I'm going too.

220
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,180
You're going to the kitchen.

221
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,180
It looks like Fuku-chan has taken a liking to you.

222
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,190
So go give her milk.

223
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,850
What?

224
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,440
You're a hit with the babies, if not with the ladies!

225
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,940
Now wai—

226
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,520
So it's one spoonful of milk per bottle, huh?

227
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,710
But how do I heat it up?

228
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,210
How did I get roped into doing this?

229
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

230
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,970
Don't worry. I'll make your milk! Don't cry!

231
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,810
Matsuda-san!

232
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,070
Here.

233
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,030
You must do this a lot.

234
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,660
Fujiko-san and I take turns watching her.

235
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,920
You're sure juggling a heavy load.

236
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,750
No. Fujiko-san has it much harder than me.

237
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,590
This is the only thing I can do to help her.

238
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:08,770
Kojiro-san, your father, is working seriously to defeat you.</i>

239
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,190
Yawara-san!

240
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,900
Y-Yes?

241
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,530
I'll take care of Fuku-chan. 
You need to go back to practice.

242
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,450
But...

243
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,040
It's fine. Just focus on your judo!

244
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,250
Okay!

245
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,050
I'll take it from here.

246
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,210
Okay. Thank you.

247
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,180
Matsuda-san.

248
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,770
U-Um, thank you for those gloves you gave me for Christmas.

249
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm sorry I didn't thank you earlier.

250
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,200
I always use them to keep my hands warm.

251
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,700
Y-You're welcome. I'm sorry they were so cheap.

252
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,120
I'll see you.

253
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,880
Good luck.

254
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
Good luck. I mean it.

255
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,430
Yuck! Did you poop your diapers?

256
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,570
Hey, nobody can enter.

257
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,030
I'm a member of this athletic gym.

258
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,160
I forgot my sweat-soaked leotards in my locker!

259
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,080
A-Ah, is that right? Then what choice do I have?

260
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,380
Give me a break!

261
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:05,130
Ever since Sayaka-san banned reporters, all I see is Yawara on the front pages!

262
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,220
Even Kosaku is fully absorbed by her!



263
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,350
What's up with that?!

264
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,270
I'll show the world how amazing Sayaka-san really is!

265
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:23,480
I'll finally awaken Kosaku to the fact that Yawara-chan isn't that great!

266
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,160
Softly... Softly...



267
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,740
Oh, they're going at it! I can see everything!

268
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,670
Smile, Sayaka-san! Show me how good you really are!

269
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,050
Oh my!

270
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,680
Wh-What are they doing?

271
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,300
Huh?

272
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:59,850
The Barcelona Olympics Are Being Held Right Now#

273
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,530
So that Kojiro put himself on lockdown, did he?

274
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:10,660
Grandpa, don't say that out loud! What if Mom hears you?

275
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,620
Oh, right. Almost forgot.

276
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,580
But he's still just the number two coach. He's got nothing on me.




277
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:22,580
I swear, your mouth is like a giant loudspeaker. You need to be more careful!

278
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,840
Yawara!

279
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,710
The Explosive Remark!

280
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,800
The Explosive Remark!

281
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,800
You'll be getting my Harai Goshi if you don't watch!
