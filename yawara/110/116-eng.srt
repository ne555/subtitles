1
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,860
What did you say?

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,080
This is to bring Yawara-san back! So please, just this once!

3
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,910
Didja just say yes?

4
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,370
I did.

5
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,920
You're really gonna do it, Beanpole?

6
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,920
Actually, Matsuda-san asked me the same thing.

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,420
Huh?

8
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,120
So I was prepared to do it even before she was born.

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,680
R-Really?

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,930
I don't know how far I'll go,
 but I'll definitely do everything I can!

11
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,380
You know damn well where you're going.
 There's only one goal.

12
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,310
If you come back aiming for the Barcelona Olympics,

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,690
that's sure to get Yawara moving again!

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,900
Root for your mama, Fukuko-chan.</i>

16
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,910
Don't Be Stupid!



17
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,870
The all-powerful Honami!

18
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,580
Coming off the World Judo Championships,

19
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,710
she dominates the 48 kg-and-unders at the Fukuoka Internationals!


20
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,170
She's really on a roll!

21
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,300
Miss Honami, congratulations!

22
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,970
You must feel that you've secured your ticket to the Barcelona Olympics.

23
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,270
The Olympics? I suppose I will go if that's what you wish.



24
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,610
Right now, your exploits are overshadowing those of Inokuma Yawara,

25
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,950
and it even appears that you might surpass her winning streak!

26
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,450
Inokuma Yawara?



27
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,160
Oh yes, I do believe she was once a factor. I completely forgot!

29
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,090
Her deportment was very much like a queen.

30
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,550
That was Miss Honami at yesterday's tournament.


31
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,720
Expectations will be high when she competes in the Barcelona Olympics.


32
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,550
Laugh while you still can!

33
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,830
Just you watch!

34
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,730
Yes, Fuku-chan?

35
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,520
Your mommy is leaving! Be a good girl!

36
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,690
So it's finally beginning?

37
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,530
Mm-hmm! I have to give her milk in two hours, so I'll be back by then.

38
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,660
Be a good girl for Daddy until Mama comes home, okay?



39
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,380
Don't push yourself too hard.

40
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,660
I won't!

41
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,170
My usual?

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,990
O-Of course!

43
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,690
So cold! This is definitely December!

44
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,230
But I have to keep at it!

45
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,070
I can't let a little cold weather get in the way of bringing Inokuma-san back!

46
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,910
Okay!


47
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,410
Let's fight!

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,650
I'm leaving!

50
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,250
Ah, it's cold!

51
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Fujiko-san?

52
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,470
Good morning!

53
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,690
See you later!

54
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,940
Fujiko-san, wait a minute!

55
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,030
Fujiko-san?!

56
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,660
I see. So she was flabbergasted?

57
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,660
Yes! How many days do you think it will take?

58
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,260
It might not take days. You might stir her stumps tomorrow.

59
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,610
However long it takes, it's only a matter of time!


60
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,980
Okay, so you started today?

61
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,220
Yes, Inokuma-san was so surprised!

62
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,190
We really need you to bring Yawara-san back to judo. I'm counting on you!

63
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,240
Leave it to me!


64
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,690
It's time to give Fuku-chan her milk. I have to get back.

65
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,580
Bye, Matsuda-san!

66
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,850
Right.

67
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,610
I'm counting on you, Fujiko-san!</i>

68
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,830
Okay!

69
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,050
Fujiko-san!

70
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,550
Good morning!

71
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,260
Going to work, are you?!

72
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,060
Fujiko-san, wait a second!

73
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,350
I tried calling you all day yesterday, but I kept getting your answering machine.


74
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,570
I have to feed her milk every two hours!

75
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,070
If you're so busy, what are you doing?!

76
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,990
Can't you tell? I'm training!

77
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,070
Training? Why?

78
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,040
You know why. I'm aiming for Barcelona!

79
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,540
Barcelona? You're not—

80
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,520
You can follow me if you want!

81
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,040
But wait, we can't have you skipping work!

82
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,130
I'll start running even earlier tomorrow. See you later!

83
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,640
Wait a minute!

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
Grandpa!

85
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,890
What is it?

86
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,570
Don't play dumb. I know you're the one pulling the strings!


87
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,400
What am I, a slimy bowl of natto? 

88
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,860
I didn't say a blessed thing! Beanpole came up with the idea herself.


89
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,870
More lies!

90
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,870
Who’s lying? This is what she told me after going through the labors of childbirth:

91
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,000
"My next goal is Barcelona. I will fight with my life to get there!"



92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,550
That courage, that insatiable spirit to take on a challenge...

93
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,380
has moved me so much it hurts!

94
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,390
I'm not going to fall for that!

95
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,460
Fujiko-san really has her hands full taking care of Fuku-chan right now!

96
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,320
She can't even get much sleep because she has to feed her!


97
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,400
Don't get her involved over me!

98
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,650
"Over me"?

99
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,400
Whaddaya mean, "Over me"?

100
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,640
This is a scheme to make me take up judo again!

101
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,370
Don't get conceited, you blasted fool!

102
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:02,000
Who in Sam Hill would work themselves to the bone to get to the Olympics for you?

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,370
Don't get such a—

104
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,880
Don't get such a swelled head, willya?

105
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,880
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san.

106
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,890
A-About what?


107
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,640
My grandpa said something stupid.

108
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,930
Huh?

109
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,520
I guess we're caught, Fuku-chan!

110
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,810
So it's true! I'm really sorry.

111
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,730
Don't be. I want to see if I really can make it to the Olympics.

112
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,400
Right along with you.

113
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,860
Let's go for it together, Inokuma-san!


114
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:45,000
I know you don't want to play a match against Sayaka-san and your father.


115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,380
But, but look...

116
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,390
Everybody is hoping and praying that you'll compete in the Olympics.


117
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,800
Actually, Master Jigoro wasn't the one who proposed this plan.

118
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,140
It was Matsuda-san! It was all his idea!


119
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,190
He's really concerned about you, you know.

120
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,320
Matsuda-san?

121
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,480
That's right! Matsuda-san really cares about you!

122
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,400
No, he doesn't.

123
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,410
I don't matter to him.

124
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,830
Inokuma-san...

125
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,290
Even my daddy says so!

126
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,290
He says if Kosaku marries me, he might take over the business one day.

127
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:36,030
Kosaku's also into that idea. He might quit All Sports News real soon.

128
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,830
Inokuma-san?



129
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,900
Who does he think he is?</i>

130
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,320
What is he thinking?</i>

131
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
What's with him?</i>

132
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,360
I don't even matter to him!</i>

133
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,410
He's quitting the newspaper, isn't he?
 Then he's marrying Kuniko-san, isn't he?</i>

134
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,410
I don't matter to him at all!</i>

135
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,940
I don't matter.

136
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,450
Yes, it doesn't matter!

137
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,100
Hello, this is All Sports.

138
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,960
Yawara-san!

139
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,050
Don't do anything stupid!

140
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,380
Don't make trouble for Fujiko-san!

141
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,620
I will not play judo!

142
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,030
Hey, wait! Let's talk it over—

143
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,870
Don't bother me ever again!

144
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,970
I am not going to play judo!

145
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,670
It doesn't matter.</i>

146
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,100
eye catch

147
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,660
Don't worry!

148
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,190
Come on. She sounded serious on the phone!

149
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,230
Don't worry! Inokuma-san will surely come back to judo!

150
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,030
But...

151
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,020
You need to keep it together!

152
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,030
You said Inokuma-san would come back if I started training for the Olympics!


153
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,620
Yeah. But things are different now!

154
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,410
This time, Yawara-san might really...

155
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,210
It's all right, Fujiko-san. You can stop!

156
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,590
I'm continuing with my training!

157
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:26,600
Until you brought it up, I never even thought about doing judo right after giving birth.

158
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,560
But now that I've started training,
I'm reminded of how much I love judo!

159
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
I want to play judo with Inokuma-san again!

160
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Yeah, but Yawara-san is not...


161
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,820
Now then, this time we're running for real! Let's fight!

162
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,070
H-Hey, wait! Fujiko-san! Fujiko-san...

163
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,280
Fujiko-san!

164
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,960
Fujiko-san...</i>

165
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,300
Yawara-san is right. I only created more trouble for you.</i>

166
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,490
But... it was all for nothing.</i>

167
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,650
No one can bring her back now.</i>

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,150
She managed to keep playing judo while she sought a reunion with her dad.</i>

169
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,690
But now she's found out that Kojiro-san is Honami Sayaka's coach.</i>



170
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,120
Yawara-san means it this time.</i>

171
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,070
Don't do anything stupid!

172
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,620
Don't make trouble for Fujiko-san!

173
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,450
I am not going to play judo!

174
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,250
Yawara-san...</i>

175
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,910
is quitting judo.</i>

176
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,810
And there goes my dream.</i>

177
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,720
Ah, I've been so busy it makes you want to laugh!

178
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,100
Your efforts are appreciated, Milady.

179
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,350
So what is the next thing on my schedule?

180
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,240
Of course. You have two appearances on television, a commercial,

181
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,050
and tonight you have a launch party for your new photo collection.

182
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,370
Ah, it's been like this all year.

183
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,790
At least I wanted to spend Christmas Eve with you, Kazamatsuri-san!

184
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:07,800
I know. Why don't we spend a romantic Eve overseas as a prenuptial trip?

185
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,080
O-Oh yes, wh-what a great idea.



186
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,300
Hey, Sayaka, I hope you're not forgetting something.


187
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,060
Comte Bernard, who took care of us in France, is visiting Japan on Christmas Eve.


188
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,770
You promised to be his hostess while he's here!

189
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,270
Whoo-hoo!</i>

190
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,950
I almost forgot. I can't very well neglect to welcome one of my father's friends.

191
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm very sorry.


192
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,420
I can't spend Christmas Eve with you.
 Don't think badly of me.

193
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,830
O-Oh, please, that's far from the case!

194
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,870
That's right!

195
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,920
Tokunaga, order a new dress for the welcoming party.

196
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,670
Of course, Milady.

197
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,840
Shin-chan's lucky!</i>


198
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,930
Inokuma-san, someone called you.

199
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,730
It's a guy, really!

200
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,040
But he hung up before I could get his name. That tells me something's going on.

201
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,240
Are you having a fling?

202
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
Of course not!

203
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,110
Matsuda-san!</i>

204
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,410
Why? I thought you were quitting your job and marrying Kuniko-san!</i>



205
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,450
I don't even matter to you anymore!</i>

206
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,040
Hello, All Sports—

207
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,800
Will you please cut it out, Matsuda-san?!

208
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,460
Matsuda is out!

209
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,920
Yawara-chan? Is that you, Yawara-chan?

210
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,470
Is this the editor?

211
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,220
How are you doing?

212
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,200
Um, where is Matsuda-san?

213
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,730
Matsuda-san went back to Yamagata with Kuni-chan.

214
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,520
Is that so?

215
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:57,710
Oh right, you should tell him that all of his recent articles are completely—

216
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,950
Matsuda-san went with Kuniko-san?</i>

217
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,870
So he really is going to quit being a reporter.</i>

218
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,970
Ah, is that right?

219
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,180
So you're here to cover the ski tournament.

221
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,560
And you came all this way too. I'm impressed.

222
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,600
All Sports is number one when it comes to cruel treatment of workers!

223
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,140
Yeah.

224
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,400
By the way, how are you feeling, Father?

225
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,690
You're calling me "Father" and asking about my health? There's no need for all that.

226
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,450
See? I'm as fit as a fiddle.

227
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,160
Keep up the tough-guy act, and I promise that you'll kick the bucket soon.





228
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,950
Kosaku! Try to be more considerate to your father!

229
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,540
Isn't that right, Father?

230
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,620
It's a crying shame. I've been getting the same kind of lip from Dragon Lady here.

231
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,130
Who are you calling "Dragon Lady"?


232
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,800
Oh! I'm shaking in my boots!

233
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,760
Oh, Father! You always say things you don't really mean, just like Kosaku!

234
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,140
All righty, I guess I'll go prepare dinner.


235
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,770
Oopsie daisy. 

236
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,400
Oh, Father, I'll help too!

237
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,260
Oh, no need. Just make yourself at home.

238
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,280
You need to help too, Kosaku!

239
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,400
You stay put! You'd only get in the way.

240
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,910
Sure thing, Dad. I hafta put together my manuscript anyway.


241
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,410
But, Father, I'm a pretty good cook.

242
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,780
Only a few young women know how to make kinpira like I do.

243
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,170
Oh, you'll make a good wife!

244
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,570
Right?

245
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,470
You don't get it, Matsuda-san!

246
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,100
My judo broke up my family.

247
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:58,280
My dad left to go train because I threw him when I was five.

248
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,780
Now he's trained Sayaka-san and returned as my enemy!

249
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,870
You have no clue how I feel!

250
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,050
Don't do anything stupid!

251
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,670
Don't make trouble for Fujiko-san!

252
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,510
I am not going to play judo!

253
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,770
Kosaku, do you want some persimmon?

254
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,060
Uh, sure.

255
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,230
You seem rather down.


256
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,110
W-Well, you're wrong.

257
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,900
It's just...

258
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,240
It's just what?

259
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,200
Dad looks like he's shrunk.

260
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,900
He returned from the brink of death, so what can you do?

261
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,500
He may not move around as much as he used to,
 but at least he's mellowed out as a result.

262
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,030
I can come back here.

263
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,690
Huh?

264
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,180
Well, I can come back and take over the hotel.

265
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,180
I thought you were a reporter?

266
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,690
I'm quitting that job.

267
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,690
Don't be stupid!

268
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,690
Why are you acting like such a damned fool?!

269
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,700
B-But...

270
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,600
But scarecrows!

271
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,200
Didn't you run off to Tokyo even though I was against it?!

272
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,210
When you left, didn't you say you'd become the best sports reporter in Japan?!

273
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,260
Were you just bluffing?!

274
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,170
I thought you were chasing after the strongest girl in the world! You're just going to quit?

275
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,080
I'm not entrusting my hotel to someone who quits halfway!





276
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,180
You'd best finish what you started!

277
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,080
If you can't do that, then give back the money I gave you for Yugoslavia!

278
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,190
Give it back now!


279
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,150

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,510
Coming!

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,010
Thank you.

Hi, you're speaking to me now.

286
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,020
Kazamatsuri-san!

287
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,520
It's been a long time since we spoke.

288
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,530
My workload's been crushing me lately.

289
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,720
Say, Yawara-san, do you have something planned for Christmas Eve?

290
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
No, I don't.

291
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,460
That's perfect!

292
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,990
The thing is, I've secured a reservation at my favorite five-star restaurant.


293
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,000
I've also taken great pains to be available to spend Christmas Eve with you.

294
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,150
What do you say, Yawara-san. Would you like to join me?


295
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
Even my daddy says so!

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,970
He says if Kosaku marries me, he might take over the business one day.

297
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,770
Of course! I'll be glad to join you.

298

Wait for me, Kosaku!


299
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,030
Why do we have to leave so soon?!

You could at least eat the kinpira gobo that I made! It's delicious!
