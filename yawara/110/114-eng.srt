00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,200
Barcelona

2
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,960
taiyou to boku no yakusoku de

3
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,960
Keeping my promise for today,

4
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,970
I ain't havin' no fun at all!

5
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,170
This is boring! Extremely, extremely boring!

6
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,420
hareta asa hayaku hitorikiri no

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,420
I got up early in the morning.

8
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,050
boku wa basu ni norikonda

9
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,050
I hopped on the bus alone.

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,470
Who gives a hoot about squid-ink risotto?

11
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:08,350
kawaridasu hora ne fuukei ga

12
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:08,350
Look, the scenery is changing,

13
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,640
Who gives a hoot about paella?

14
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,930
More!

15
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,850
Who gives a hoot about the World Judo Championships?

16
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,940
saboten wo mezasu konna boku ni

17
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,940
and it whistled softly for me

18
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,200
sotto kuchibue wo fuku

19
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,200
as I headed for the cactuses.

20
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,820
Hey!

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,070
natsu no hajime ni bokura wa

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,070
We put on the shirts that we loved

23
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,950
Who gives a hoot about Barcelona?

24
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,290
daisuki na shatsu wo kite

25
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,290
at the start of summer.

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,130
A Barcelona World Championship without Yawara ain't worth a damn!

27
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,580
tabi ni deyou kimi to boku wa

28
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,580
When we go on our respective trips,

29
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,020
yottoshitara deau

30
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,020
we might meet each other.

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,800
Now, now, why don't you relax and enjoy the trip, Master Jigoro?

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,630
Hmph!

33
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,100
Yawara shoulda been the one to turn Barcelona into a crucible of excitement!

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,610
All right, Master, give me a pose!

35
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,110
I ain't getting no souvenirs for that stupid, no-goodnik office girl!

36
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,570
The World's Greatest Heiress



37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,240
Why isn't she here?!

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,620
Why won't Yawara come to the World Championships?!

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,130
I was looking forward to competing against her this time!

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,220
Why did she lose by default at the All-Japan Selected Championships?

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,510
Was she injured? Was she sick?

42
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,530
N-No.

43
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,600
Then why? Matsuda!

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,980
Matsuda!


45
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,610
Yawara lost by default?

46
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,500
I trained myself to death so I could make up for losing to her at the last World Championships!

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,620
Give it up, Khrushchev. You can't fight someone who didn't show. 

48
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,000
You too, Teleshikova, entered the open weights only to fight Yawara.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,480
It's a shame you can't.




50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,510
No, I was a little relieved once I heard she lost by default.

51
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,890
I'll be the first person in the world to defeat Yawara in a match.



52
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,020
My dream is still attainable.

53
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,280
What did you say?

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,490
Yawara's not competing? That can't be!

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,200
I came here to fight Yawara! But now...

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,250
Outrageous!

57
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,700
I thought I'd become the first person to beat Yawara!

58
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,690
I feel cheated!

59
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,960
Jody, Teleshikova, Li from China, and Gonzalez from Cuba...</i>

60
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,510
All of the star players from around the world came here to fight Yawara-san.</i>

61
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,530
But... Yawara-san didn't come, after all.</i>

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,030
Hell, it's not just that. She might even quit judo completely.</i>



63
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,740
You don't understand!

64
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,500
You don't get it, Matsuda-san!

65
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,750
My judo broke up my family.

66
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,880
My dad left to go train because I threw him when I was five.

67
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,480
Now he's trained Sayaka-san and returned as my enemy!

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,440
Just to beat me!

69
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,010
You have no clue how I feel!

70
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,070
What should I do?</i>

71
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,460
Tokunaga!


72
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,780
What's the meaning of this room?

73
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,700
I said specifically to bring my own bed and furniture here!


74
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,980
Of course! The transport was delayed, but they will arrive soon!

75
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,400
Honestly!


76
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,980
This is why I didn't wish to enter the World Championships!

77
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,540
We're returning to the oceanside villa.


78
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,920
Pack up our things!

79
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,400
Of course!

80
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,160
But, Sayaka-san, it takes too much time to get to the arena from your villa!

81
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,000
This hotel makes things a whole lot easier!


82
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,820
I won't be competing.

83
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,500
I only play judo in order to fight Inokuma Yawara.

84
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,970
I am not the least bit interested in the World Judo Championships!

85
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,460
Y-Yeah, but...


86
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,970
You won't be abstaining on my watch.

87
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,410
You will play in the tournament.

88
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,490
No, I won't! What's the use of being the World Judo Champion?

89
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,360
How many times must I tell you?


90
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,490
This is another one of my practice sessions, an extension of the dojo challenge tour!

91
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,500
I will continue coaching you until you take on Yawara.



92
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,040
Are we clear?

93
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,010
If you can win the championship, then do it.

94
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,040
Tokunaga! I need my bed and furniture here right now!

95
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,400
Y-Yes, ma'am!

96
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,400
Also, Milady, it is time for your press conference!

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,710
Press conference?

98
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,920
We superstars do not have it easy.

99
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,780
Tokunaga, I am changing!

100
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,410
Y-Yes, ma'am!


101
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:06,420
Strange as it seems, she definitely sees him as her master.</i>

102
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,710
I stand in awe of you, Kojiro-san.</i>

103
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,510
In any case, Yawara-san isn't here.</i>

104
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,490
Spain is a country of passion.</i>


105
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,250
This is where I wanted to become passionate with her.</i>

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,190
Yawara-san...</i>

107
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,280
Kazamatsuri-san?

108
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,640
Will you escort me to the press conference?

109
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,400
O-Of course!

110
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,600
Then let's go, Kazamatsuri-san.

111
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,750
S-Sure!

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,340
Miss Honami, how do you feel about taking on the world's best players?


113
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,420
How enthusiastic are you about winning a medal?

114
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:54,130
A medal? Those gilded trinkets don't interest me in the least!

115
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:01,310
But if that is what you wish to see, there is only one that suits me.

116
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,640
The gold!



117
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,660
Yawara, what happened?</i>

118
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,450
What happened to you?!</i>

119
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,960
Headline: World Judo Championships, Women's 72-kg Heavyweights
Sidebar: J. Rockwell (of Canada) Champion#

120
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,450
That's amazing! Jody-san is really incredible!

121
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey, did you see this article, Inokuma-san?

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,790
Huh?

123
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,930
Yeah, I did.

124
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,610
But what's really incredible is your belly, Fujiko-san.

125
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,140
It really is!

126
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,900
It's coming along very well, and it's making me as big as a house!

127
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,110
It's Hanazono-san's and my baby after all.

128
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,030
I can't wait!

129
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,690
Me either!

130
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,210
So, Inokuma-san.

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,720
I know you must be tired of hearing the same question, but are you ready to talk?

132
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,710
Why didn't you play in the All-Japan Selected Tournament?




133
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,390
Don't worry!

134
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,190
You don't have to say a thing if you don't want to!

135
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,770
It's not like you're going to quit judo entirely.

136
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,600
Say, do you want some cake?

137
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,110
Cake always cheers a girl up!

138
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,210
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san, for making you worry.

139
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,680
Wh-What are you saying?

140
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,680
It moved!

141
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,190
It's amazing how full of life it is.
 It kicks inside me all the time!

142
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,950
I don't have a preference,
 but Hanazono-san wants a girl.

143
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,950
He wants to start giving it judo lessons as a baby, so that it will grow up to be strong as you!

144
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,220
You mustn't!


145
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,830
What if that kid throws Hanazono-kun as a result?

146
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,680
Hanazono-kun will go off on a journey to train himself, tearing the family apart!

147
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,220
Inokuma-san, are you still upset about that?

148
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,690
That's not your fault!

149
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,440
And what if he becomes her rival's coach just to defeat her?



150
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,450
So you can't do that.

151
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,410
N-No way!

152
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,310
A-Are you saying that your dad is Honami Sayaka's...

153
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,880
Honami's fast!

154
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,430
In her 48 kg-and-under semifinal match,

155
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,810
she starts off with her lightning-fast combination moves!



156
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,520
She finishes strong with a Harai Goshi Ippon!

157
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,350
Japan's Honami advances to the finals with Ippon wins in every round!

158
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,550
These are the World Judo Championships.

159
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,430
We're at the Palau Blaugrana in Barcelona, where the large crowd is cheering!

160
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,850
And here she is, donning a crimson cape, the favorite of the Spanish fans!




161
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,710
It's as if she's a matador at a bullfight!

162
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,080
Another flamboyant performance!

163
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,750
Maybe it's because of her stunning moves, but she's completely won over the Spanish crowd!

164
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,200
On her way to the 48 kg-and-under championship match,

165
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,370
Japan's Honami Sayaka has won all her matches with Ippons!

166
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,800
Amigo!

167
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,980
And facing Honami Sayaka

168
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,270
is the woman who fought Inokuma Yawara in the final match at the Yugoslavia tournament.

169
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,680
She's honed her trademark Ura Nage and Sukui Nage, winning all her matches with Ippons.





170
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,310
She's the bruiser, Khrushchev!

171
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,990
Sayaka-san, be careful!

172
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,790
Yawara-san may have defeated her in forty seconds the last time around,

173
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,000
but she's made huge leaps in speed and power since then!

174
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,630

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,510
Yes?


176
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,510
Will you refrain from comparing me to that cowardly girl who runs from a fight?

177
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,110
If it took Yawara forty seconds to win, then it will only take me ten.

178
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,110
Sayaka-san!




179
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,620
Khrushchev! Don't lower your guard just because your opponent isn't Yawara Inokuma!

180
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:05,090
Don't worry, Coach. I always go all out, whenever I play.



181
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,590
No matter how trivial the opponent.

182
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,250
The two challengers enter the ring!

183
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,850
The women's 48 kg-and-under final match is about to begin!

184
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,510
Bah, this stinks! How is Spain a "country of passion"?


185
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,510
But, Master, I do believe you've had some fun.

186
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,470
You've bought a lot of souvenirs.

187
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,690
Without Yawara, you won't even see sparks in this "country of passion"!

188
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,030
Yutenji, wanna get something at the food stand?

189
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,360
What are you saying?

190
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,030
If we don't hurry, we'll miss Honami's match!



191
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,960
I like the looks of their food, but I guess you're right.

192
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,880
Let's see what'cha got, Kojiro!

193
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,670
Kojiro?

194
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,300
Bow!

195
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,190
Hajime!


196
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
The match begins!

197
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,190
Honami Sayaka takes on the world in place of the invincible Inokuma Yawara!


198
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,950
Can she really fill Inokuma's shoes and win the gold?

199
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,850
These cheers were supposed to be for Yawara-san!</i>


200
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:18,010
Dammit! Will Yawara-san ever face these cheering crowds again?</i>

201
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,110
Yuko!

202
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
She got a Yuko!

203
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,110
Her Kouchi Gari at the beginning of the match netted her a Yuko!



204
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,620
Sayaka-san is so cool!

205
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,280
She's powerful! And against Khrushchev...

206
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,630
Sh-She really is that strong!

207
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,840
I-Incredible, Sayaka-san!

208
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,010
She's...

209
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,060
What are you doing, Khrushchev? Watch what you're doing!


210
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,710
I can't believe I let that happen!

Yes?

214
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,090
Sorry, but could you make ten copies of these documents?

215
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,260
Of course! Ten copies, correct?

216
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,130
Yep!

217
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,070
Inokuma-san? Did you find out about the matter we discussed?

218
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,570
Ah, yes, I'll get the charts later.

219
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,880
Really? I'll leave it to you then.

220
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,850
Yes, sir!

221
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,590
Hey, Inokuma-kun! Got a minute?

222
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,550
Of course! I'll be there right away!

223
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,430
Oh! It's Khrushchev with a Kata Guruma!

224
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,970
But Honami's too fast. She evades it easily!

225
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,230
And then...

Japan's Honami is too strong!

She follows up her Yuko with a Waza Ari!

Hmph!

233
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,640
Khrushchev, move it! Don't lose to her speed!

234
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:25,240
Stop laughing! My only opponent is Yawara Inokuma!

235
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,580
Whoa! Khrushchev goes behind her! An Ura Nage?

236
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,050
Ippon! Done!

237
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,180
Sh-She won!

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,620
She's strong! Powerful beyond words!

Honami Sayaka is now literally the queen sitting atop the world throne!

Oh, my God! She's even more amazing than that dumb Yawara-chan!

Sayaka-san will be on our front page tomorrow, right, Kosaku?

Kojiro-san, what have you done?

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,900
Sh-She didn't give Khrushchev an inch!

245
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,060
Honami has grown into a fearsome player!

246
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,120
Who on earth coached her to such strength?!

247
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,070
He's just the world's number two coach!

248

I can't believe Honami Sayaka-san's coach is Inokuma-san's father.

252
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,060
Inokuma-san will quit judo at this rate!
