Of coulrse I didn't!

228
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,758
I was always thinking about you.

229
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,093

00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:49,764

00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,391

Shut up! I said "another one!"

239
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,921
Is that true?

240
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,386
So I really was the reason.
The reason Dad's gone...

241
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,263
That's not true.

242
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,515
That's not true, Yawara-san.

243
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:38,855
I was so moved. I got to see Yawanra's
true talent with my own eyex.

244
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:44,944
You are the only one who can persuade her.

245
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,530
Where did you go, Kojiro-san?

246
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,787

00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:06,383

00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,968
No way!

251
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,513
I couldn't stop thinking about you!

252
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,975
I wish I could"ve fed you galbi there.

253
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,436
Really .

254
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,399
You have no worries at all.

255
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,608
Matsuda-san!

256
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,068
Who is this guy?

257
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,445
How can you be chit-chatting at a time like this?!

258
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,950

Will you cut it out?

262
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,628
Wait, you punk!

263
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,839


264
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,090

00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,174
Ye...

266
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,134

00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,354


275
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,189
What did you say?

276
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,150
KojEro...

277
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,694
She jluat said lnokuma Kojiro?!

278
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,863
I'm sure I heard it!

279
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,114
What are you saying?

280
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:11,531


281
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,450
What about Kojiro?

282
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,285
What are you talking about?

283
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:15,744


284
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,121
You've had ton much to drink, Maltsuda-savn.

285
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,834
Ahhh, that was fun!

286
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,754
Everyone is so nice. Right, hnokumawsan?

287
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,379

288
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:26,838


289
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,758
Especiavllly Ha-nazono-kun.

290
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,425
Eh?

291
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:36,431
He also learned the greatness of youth from you!

292
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,601
Just as I thought, your judo is amazing.

293
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,603
That's not true,

294
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:49,110
Move and more people will be moved by
your judo at the Barcelona Olympics.

295
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,612
Dc youxr best, llnckuma-saln!

296
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,405


297
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,615
Umm, Fujiko-san .....

298
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,620
I can already imagine you at the Olympia!

299
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,581
Hewhobd on a moment, Fujiko-san.

300
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,000
I... I can't keep doing this.

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,089


302
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:09,923


303
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:10,215


304
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,811
No way?!

305
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,062
You're joking.

306
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,021


307
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,065
You must be joking, right?

308
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:27,899
Right? Right?

309
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,280
Why?

310
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,573


311
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:40,870
Because of my j'udo, my famiwly is scattered.

312
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,871
So...

313
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,208
That... that...

314
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,418
Fujiiko-san!

315
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,962
That's a lie-l

316
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,755


317
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,881
I'm sorry...

318
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:52,841


319
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,384
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san.

320
00:18:54,384 --> 00:19:00,098


321
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:00,765


322
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,266


323
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,273
That's lnokuma Koj'i rmsan.

324
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:12,694
But I'm surprised that you asked him.

325
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:17,741
It doesn't mean anything if he
doesn't agree to coach me.

326
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,953
I'm guessing the contract fee is the problem.

327
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:26,374
Takunaga, how much did you offer him?

328
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,710
zoo million yen.

329
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,171
aoo million yen?!

330
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,506
That is so...

331
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,467
Rude.

332
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,761


333
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:42,849
It's rude to offer so little money to someone
who wiM train my daugwter

334
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,852
to become a gold medalist at
the Barcelona Olympics.

335
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,896
Exactly, Tokunaga.

336
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,273
Double the contract fee.

337
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,275
Dad! I'm so happy!

338
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,152
That's the reason...

339
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:59,032
That's why I hues-item to break
off our engagement.

340
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:05,789
I don't wam to be rude, but do you think
he is qualified to coach Miss Swan?

341
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,791
Hmmm, I see.

342
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,586
"Judging jewels," you mean.

343
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,755
Then we have KazamaKsuri-sanl

344
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:21,012
Oh, yes. You can ascertain the quality
of his judo, Kazavmatsuri-kun.

345
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,765
Me" you want me to...?!

346
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,769
I"m beggilng you, Kazamatsuri-san.

347
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,149
Higher, a little higher.

348
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,820


349
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,031
You guys, we shouldn't be doing this!

350
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,033
Why don't you go home?

351
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:47,330
There is something, There
is something about Kojiro.

352
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,708
Oh, ah no...

353
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,219
What's he eating?

354
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,556
He ardered hotbwns awhi'le ago.

355
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,890
Please be quiet.

356
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,435


357
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:12,022
Kazamatsuri-san, why don't you start?

358
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:12,856


359
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,400
You will do it for me, won't you?

360
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,861
Then... I'm going...

361
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,321
Why did you take off your shoes?

362
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,533
So that he can't hear me approaching.

363
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,909
I'm so happy!

364
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,048
I don't sense any danger.

365
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,719
Then I should get closer.

366
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,932
It doesrft seem like he notices me.

367
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,060
Here I go.

368
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,187


369
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,730
Ouch !

370
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,231
Kazamatsuwri-san?

371
