1
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,098
Teles'hikova is persistant with her sweeps!

2
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,015
Out of bounds!

3
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:39,683
Wait!

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,810

00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:43,687

00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:58,618
Even Yaw-are wi-ll loss against her in the
finals if she hats her guard down.

21
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:58,910


22
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,745
Stop them!

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,497
Someone!

24
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,624
Someone gmp them!

25
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,003
It's all over for her!

26
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,631
Rockwell has injured her leg!

27
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,050
W-wa.it a milnute!

28
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,011
Give your advice tn Yawara-san!

29
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,220
Show hear the letter!

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,389
Vawara will understand that message!

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,736
lipipaon !

32
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,538
W-wow!

33
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,334
TeleshIWknva made a throw
at the very last second!

34
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,170
Anna Tobesilwva of Russia makes
her way to the finals!

35
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,714
Jody Rockwell of Canada is taken down!

36
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,842
Jody. . .

37
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,261
Jody!

38
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:58,887
Jody!
Jody !

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,596
Stay out!

40
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,389
They haven't bowed yet.

41
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,272
Jody...

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,194
Bow!

43
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:25,121


44
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,789
Jody!

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,915
No!

46
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,416
Wow!

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:33,421
Jody Rockwell must have exhaustsd
hefself from that fierce match!

48
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,008
lit's amazing that she held on until nmv.

49
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,887
A nmmal person would have gone unconscious
the moment her knee was injured.

50
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,472
Jody. . .

51
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,890
Stay with us!

52
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,266
Get a stretcher!

53
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,395
Jody...

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,912
You were swam that Jody hurt
her leg, and you will did that.

55
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,343
It was a tremendous match,

56
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,554
with an unexpected turn of events!

57
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:27,350
It will be Teheshjkuva of the Soviet Union
who will-l be fighting IInokunma Vawavra!

58
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,188
Mr. Yamashita, she finally used a throw.

59
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,526
Yes, it looked as if she was hiding it.

60
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,777
Th a-t's right.

61
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,237
She was hiding it.

62
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,447


63
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:45,869
That army cut girl was avoiding
showing her throw to Yawara.

64
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,831
She must have been afraid of letting
Vawara study the timing.

65
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:54,336
So that's why she's been using swaps
and grappling up until now?

66
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,464
But Jody was incredible too,

67
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,134
She farced her to uke a throw to end the match.

68
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,761
Want a ham sandwich?

69
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,013
Oh, thank you.

70
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:12,812
Either way, it's incredible that she came this
far without using her finishing move.

71
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,066
That's nothing!

72
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,151
She's no match against Yawara!

73
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,322
I, Inokuma Jigoro. trained her to be the best.

74
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:28,328
On top of that, she's the girl who had the talent
to threw her father at the age of five.

75
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,538
At the age of Fwel?

76
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,998
She threw Mr. Koj'ilrol?

77
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,293
It's so mean.

78
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,004
Teleshiknva has done too much.

79
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,050
She was hurting your beg until the last minute.

80
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,011
That's no match.

81
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,847
No, that's not true.

82
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,683
Jody, are you awake now?

83
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,851
Are you a-Ul right, honey?

84
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,771
That's a match too.

85
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,857
I couldn't help it, Yawara.

86
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,614
Yawam, I broke our promise.

87
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,449
Never mind that.

88
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,828
I wanted to fight you at the finalx

89
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,790
Jody, we can someday.

90
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm sure... once your leg is healed.

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,255
Jody.

92
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,881
Sorry da-rlting.

93
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,176
We must postpone our wedding ceremozny.

94
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:32,058
l"ll have to save my wedding
dress wntjl my leg gets well.

95
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,184
DonT worry.

96
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,770
What did she say?

97
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,690
Unfortunately, they must
postpone their wedding.

98
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,862
She can't wear her wedding
dress until her leg heal;

99
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,870
Jody, dcn't warry!

100
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,163
You can wear it soon.

101
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,665
l"m sure you'll louk wonderful
fn your wedding dress.

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,710
Yawara,

103
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,213
I want to tell you, thank you.

104
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,924
I recovered from. my injury as best I could,

105
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,677
because I wanted no fight you.

106
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,265
It's because of you that I mullnd come this far.

107
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,059
Jody. . .

108
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,646
Thank you. Yawara.

109
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,815
Jody. . .

110
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:25,111


111
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,529
Jody!

112
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,622
Now, we're finally at the finals!

113
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,165
Will n be l-nukuma Yawanra of Japan?!

114
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,750
Or Tevleshilkova of the Soviet Union?!

115
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,714
The final match of the Women's Judo
World Cup is about to begin!

116
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,100
Sheeah! Where has Kosaku gone?

117
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,559
Its so hot!

118
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,312
Kosaku!

119
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,904
I must show her the letter!

120
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,409
Even Yawara will lose against her in the finalsA

121
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,537
I must show her the letter!

122
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,747
Or else, Yawara-san will.,.

123
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:24,671
Will llnoku-ma be able to defeat Telsshilwva
and bring the gold medal to Japan?

124
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,756
The Wnal match is about to begin!

125
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,344
Man, that Teleshikova is incredible.

126
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,763
Will Inlokuma-aelnpaj be all right?

127
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,225
Hey guys, aren't you dome eating yet?

128
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,768
Than leave.

129
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,062
Are you kidding?!

130
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,441
Yawairavchan's about to fight!

131
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,567
That's none of my concern.

132
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm talking about business here.

133
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,779
Damn yau...

134
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,657
Then we just need to order more, huh?!

135
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,534
Anodwer order of extra large ramnen!

136
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,285
Sure!

137
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,790
The match against Jody Rockwell
was melhevnt, Tebeshuikava.

138
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,669
The Presidnent is expecting another
good performance as well.

139
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,757
I'd love to see another good match
against Yawara llnokuma too.

140
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,675
Don't worry.

141
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:15,347
All the data about Yawara Inokuima
is in her head now.

142
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,766
There is no way she'd lose.

143
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,019
But you can't undereitimate her.

144
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,854
Especially her i-ppon zeori.

145
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,940
Yawara Inokuma's mppan zeoi . . .

146
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,779
Thavt ilppon zecn' would be fatal to hear.

147
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,243
I'm sure you are fully aware of thig

148
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:45,335
but Telsshikova has incredlixbie speed
on top of her weight advantage.

149
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,880
Don't let her tska you down to the mat.

150
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,008
And dovnT let her grab the back of your collar.

151
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,431
Yawara-san?

152
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,935
Inokuma-san, it's almost time for you.

153
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,228
Yes.

154
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,735
For the final match cf the
Women's Judo World Cup,

155
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,113

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:31,589

168

Yawaara, I want to tell ymu, thank you.

169
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,471
I recovered from my injury as best I cnubd,

because I wanted to frght you.

171
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,809
Jody...

172
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,937
Yawara, be careful.

173
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,605
Teleshikova is strong.

174
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,191
No, Jody

175
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,235
You were stronger.

176
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,113
Teleshfkava hurt your leg...

177
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,741
She hurt your leg intentionally to win.

178
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,661
l wiill cure my leg again.

179
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,622
I will marry him once I"m healed.

180
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,083
Then I will challenge you.

181
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,918
You're the best j-u-dno wrext'ler in the worhd!

182
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,671
Jody...

183
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,841
Yawara-chan! Look this way!

184
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,260
See? There's a fan letter too-l

185
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,769
She looks so scary...

186
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,858
I must show her the letter...

187
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,693
The letter from Kojiro-san...

188
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,111
To Yawara-san!

189
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,240
Wait for me, Yawara-san!

190
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,368
Don't start the match yet!

191
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,244
Or elsem

192
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,871
Or else."

193
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,976
Lady Sayaka, the match is about to begin.

194
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,144
The match?

195
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,354
What are you talking about?

196
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:13,191
The free weight ftnals that
Inokuma Yawara fights inn.

197
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,529
What shall I do?

198
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,740
Should I bring the TV in here?

199
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,367
I'm in the middle of my training.

200
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,660
Go away, Tokulnauga.

201
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,205
Biml. .

202
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,464
Dear. . .

203
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,718
she'll be fine, wont she?

204
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,345
You're watching her fmrn close by.

205
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,225
So there's nothing to worry about, right?

206
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,020


207
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,856
Yawara is a strong giwrl.


208
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,910
This is a huge uxproar!

209
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,205
Inukuwma of Japan just showed up!

210
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,168
Ever since her debut, she hasn't lost a match yet.

211
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,628
She is a freshman at Mitswba
Women's Jun-ior Callllege.

212
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,921


213
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:23,178
Such a amalll girl is now the idol d this Chang
Chung Gymnasium here in Seoul, Korea!

214
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,139
lv-lnokuma!

215
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,266
You can do it, knokuma!

216
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,809
rm with you!

217
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:35,106
l, Ha'nazono Kaoru, may be physically far away,
but Il'lll always be near you in my heart!

218
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,859
Once she gets possessed by a monster like you,

219
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,445
she'll lose the match that
she could wtn otherwise.

220
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,656
In order to protect Yawara-chan
from this monstet...

221
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,786
tell us Yawara-xanx phone number. damn it!

222
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:48,495


223
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,622
You can do it, llnokuma!

224
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:50,789


225
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,791
Innokwmawsan!

226
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,500


227
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,626
You're doing great!

228
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,377
One more!

229
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,754
One more, and you'll be the best in the world!

230
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,046


231
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,215
I don't really understand what's going on,

232
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,592
but Inokuma-san is still pretty good.

233
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,261
My heart's starting to beat fast.

234
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,099
You all finalllly realized that?!

235
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,058
This is it!

236
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:14,270
This is thne exciting days of our youth
that we were about to forget!

237
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,938
Right?

238
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:15,939
Right?

239
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,273
Vou all feel that?

240
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,025
We do.

241
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,112
But I :Ltill don't understand the judo rules...

242
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,739
See, you lme if you falll on your bottom.

243
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,118
Anyway, what we cam do right
now is to cheer far hnef.

244
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,744
Come on, stand up!

245
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,751
Hurray! Hurray! Yawara!

246
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,377
Go!

247
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,337
Hurray! Hurray! Yawara!

248
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,214
Fight! Fight! Vawaara!

249
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,757
That's the spirit!

250
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:58,148


251
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,108
What do you think, Yamashita-sa-n?

252
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:05,238
We can't help but lay aur hopes on Innokuoma when
the rest of our Japanese team didnht do so well.

253
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,031
I mdeed .

254
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:10,702
I hope she will not be crushed under the
pressure, and willl fight to
the best of her abilities.

255
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,997
Mr. Inokuma Jigom, what do you think,

256
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,624
seeing yuur granddaughter
on this international stage?

257
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,043
I dnn't Iikg int.

258
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,844
Now, Teleshikova of the Soviet
Union has shown up too.

259
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,310
Was the reason she had a d'fffirudt time
in the match against Rockwell,

260
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,188
because she hid her best move
to prepare for this one?

261
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,523
Teleghiikova is really ominous!

262
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,280
It's time for them to face off!

263
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,628
D-Don't start it yet, Yawara-san...

264
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,754
I must. t.

265
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,714
I must show her the letter!

266
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,800
Step forward!

267
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,402
Yawara Inokuma. ..

268
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,488
I've waited for a long time to fight you.

269
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,658
Teleshikova."

270
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,164
Stay away!

271
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,334
if you come close to me now,
Hi! and up beating you.

272
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,336


273
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,674
You brushed away my dad's photo

274
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,930
And you intentionallyh.

275
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,686
You intentionally hurt Jody's leg.

276
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,406
The letter... to Yawara-san!

277
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:19,789
Bow!

278
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,300
Ya...

279
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,384
Yawaramsaun!

280
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,098
Teleshilmva. ..

281
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:42,062
Even Yawara will lose against her in the finals.

282
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,066
Begin I

283
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,861
Wam Yawara-saan! Read the letter!

284
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,866
You big indiot!

285
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:58,411
lnokuma parfornns an ippmn
zeoi at the very beginning!

286
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,414
Thm'll be good!

287
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,958
No, Teleshikova hangs on!

288
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,460
She barely hangs on!

289
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,630
Yuko!

290
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,507
A yulko already!

291
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,302
The ippan zeoi already gave her a yuako!

292
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,889
She's very highwgpllrfted now!

293
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,058
Ilnokuma of Japan is dating wenlll!

294
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,605
That's the spirit, lnokuma-sayn!

295
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,483
Keep throwmg her We that!

296
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,946
Keep gmlng just like that, Inokuma!

297
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:33,905


298
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,156
Yeah!

299
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,950
That's our Yawara-cha-n!

300
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,951


301
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,160
Yawara. . .

302
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,452


303
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,456
Damn, that was so close to an ilppon...

304
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,959
Oh yeah, I need to show her the letter.

305
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,919
Kaga- k'un !

306
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,796
Kagwkun, where are you?!

307
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,965
Kagaw k'un !

308
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:56,094
She won a ywko already.

309
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,930
I can only hope that she"ll keep going like that.

310
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,475
Begin!

311
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,190
Teleshikova...

312
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,901
How dare...

313
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,611
How dare you hurt Jody!

314
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,699
She goes to annudnevr mppon zeoi already!

315
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,953
Teleshikova hangs on!

316
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,998
This ippon zemi is no good?

317
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:25,874
No...

318
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,878
Wow! An ouchi gari!

319
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,256
Yuko!

320
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,175
Amazing!

321
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,552
She is unstoppable!

322
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,597
She has won two yukn already!

323
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:47,062
Yamashuita-san. it's not just ipzpzon zeoi,
but her other moves are sha rp too!

324
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:52,233
It's her continuous movement that makes
her ipipon zeoi more effective.

325
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,529
if she moves to do an OlUChli gari, the opponent
wm naturally pull away from her waist

326
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:01,701
And that posture is optimal for lnokuma
to perform an ippon zerovi.

327
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,703
I see.

328
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,915
Telexhilknva is doing good too.

329
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:11,711
She got away from lnukuma's moves at the last
minute, and she stopped them at yuko

330
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,505
Right, Master?

331
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,009
It's Yawara's fault that ghe let her do that.

332
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,512
As lmng as she keeps gaming like that,

333
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,390
she might Ime this match.

334
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:26,935
Begin!

335
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,954
I've never seen Yawara-san like this,

336
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,623
That serious expression

337
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,500
Those highly energized moves

338
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,212
There is so much of Yawara-san
that I've never known before.

339
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,130
I want to know more!

340
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,590
I want to know everything about you!

341
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,680
Those are the eyes.

342
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,559
The same eyes I saw when she fought
against Jody at her dojo.

343
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,269
She's serious now.

344
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:15,900
No, she's looking scarier this time.

345
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,985
Kosaku !

346
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:17,652


347
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,946
Where the heck have you been?

348
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,989
Kaga-kun!
Where the heck have you been?

349
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,574
Where's the letter?

350
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,617
Did you give the letter to Yawam-saan?

351
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,702
The letter?

352
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,747
Don't you have the letter addressed
to Yawarawan?!

353
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,540
Oh, this?

354
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,416


355
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,086
Oh, you're bad!

356
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,588
You're reading someone's letter!

357
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,427
Watch out for Te besh:ikova's uranage.

358
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,765
Teleshiknva's manage. . .

359
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,602
This is bad!

360
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:51,770
Yawara-sam !

361
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,232
With two yukos, Iznokuma has a great advantage.

362
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,235
How will Teleshikova retaliate?

363
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,945
Just watch, Jody,

364
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,238
I'll beat her up quickly.

365
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,241
Inokuxma continues to be aggressive!
