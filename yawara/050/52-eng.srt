1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:39,015


2
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,809
ltpupon !

3
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,769
W-wow!

4
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,773
Teleshikova made a throw
at the very last secunud!

5
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,150
Anna Telesh-ikova of the Soviet Union
makes her way to the finals!

6
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,444
Jody Rockwell of Canada is taken down!

7
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,738
It's so mean.

8
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,282
Teleshikova has gone too far.

9
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,078
She was hurting your beg until the Last minute.

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,830
That's no match.

11
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,291
No, that's not true.

12
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,459


13
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,211
That's a match too.

14
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,296
I couldn't help it.

15
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,134
W-wait a minute!

16
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,052
Give your advice to Yawara-san!

17
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,345
Show her the letter!

18
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,264
Yawaara will understand that message!

19
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,432


20
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,853
Yawam, I broke our promise.

21
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,104
Nevermind that,

22
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,025
I wanted to fight you in the finals,

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,903
Jody, we can someday.

24
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,530
I'm sure... once your leg is healed.

25
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,783
Oh, you're bad!

26
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,243
You're reading someone else s letter!

27
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,995
This is...

28
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,123
Watch out for Teleshikova's uranage.

29
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,418
Telneshikcwa  s manage. . .

30
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,173
With two yukos, mokuma has a great advantage.

31
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,300
How wflil Teleshikcwa retaliate?

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,718
Just watch, Jody.

33
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,678
l'll beat her up quickly.

34
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,847
Inokurma cunutinues to be aggressive!

35
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,349
Wait, Yawanra-san!

36
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,684
manage!

37
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,852
Watch out for her manage-S

38
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,731
IInokuIma goes for another iwppoun zeoi!

39
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:28,875


40
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,304
Yawara !

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,645
No...

42
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,396
A...

43
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,689
Waza ari E

44
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,856
Out of bounds! Wa-it!

45
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,983
It was a waza an!

46
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,362
lmakuxma was so chose to losing bvy ippown!

47
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,324
Yawara-san. ..

48
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,287
Man, that was so clnse, Vamashliita-san!

49
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,956
That was why!

50
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:13,420
The reason Teleshnikova came all the way to
the semi-finats without using any throws,

51
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,340
is all for that manage!

52
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,847
So, Yamashi'ta-san, was Teleshikma saving that
manage for the match against Ilnokuma?

53
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,848
Yes.

54
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,728
The reason she took lno.kum.a's first ippon zeoj,

55
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,272
was probably because she wanted
to team its timing.

56
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,864
What a woman...

57
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,283
I leaked a little...

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,910
She's strong...

59
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,289
Hey, would you gst out of
here when you're done?

60
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,292
Fine, give us more.

61
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,044
Five more orders of ramen.


62
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,256
You're gtill fine, lrnokuma.

63
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,300
You can get plenty of waza ari in no time at all!

64
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,802
I can't...

65
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,262
I cant watch this...

66
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,014
My heart is about to stop...

67
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:06,723
Oh?

68
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,308
Look, Fuj'ikc-san.

69
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,854
Yawara!


70
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,150
Women's Judo Wodd Cup free weight finals.

71
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,944
Teleshilkova of the Soviet Union
against Innokuuma of Japan.

72
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,779
Oh?

73
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,613
Oh?!

74
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,781
lnokuma is ML.

75
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,742
lznokuma is not getting up!

76
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,786
Whats going on?!

77
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,580
She's not moving!

78
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,792
Could she have been knocked
unconscmus by that uranage?

79
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,045
Yawara-aaan!

80
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,630

85
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,607

What? I;

87
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,861
Dude, try saying that again! Dammit!

88
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,614
No way...
Dude, try saying that again! Dammit!

89
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,075

97
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,925
Don't move, Jody.

98
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,553
Yawavra!

99
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,477

I'm sorry.

111
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,049
I'm sorry, Dad.

112
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,641
I won't do it again.

113
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,643
I won't do it again,

114
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,645
so Dad...

115
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,272
Dad...

116
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,401
Dad...

117
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,617
Yawarau.

118
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,496
Yawara. .

119
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,755
My leg will heal again.

120
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,259
Then lwill challenge you.

121
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,594
You are the best wrestler in the world!

122
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,431
Jody... Jody...

123
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,810
Ya wara!

124
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,730

126
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,407
Is that you, Dad?

127
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,496

Get up!

140
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,115


141
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,367
Matsudavsam?

142
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,121
That's it!

143
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,373
Get up, Yawara-sanl

144
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,627
Are you okay?

145
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,171
She's awake!

146
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,215
Inokuma is getting up!

147
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,634
She's nodding to the questions from the judges.

148
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,677
Yeah!

149
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,136
Good jab, Yawara-san!

150
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,765
Hurray!

151
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:58,932


152
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,599
Hurray!

153
00:09:59,599 --> 00:09:59,808


154
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,059
Hurray!

155
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,603
Master, one more order of dumplings!

156
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,022
She got up!

157
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,607
She really did!

158
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,775


159
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,114
lnokuma! Guts!

160
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,449
Yawara. . .

161
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,229
Are you okay?

162
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,192
Do you feel dizzy?

163
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,989
Matsuda-san?

164
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,490


165
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,701
I thought it was Dad's voice.

166
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,785


167
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,329
A very relaxing voice.

168
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,372


169
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,415
Matsuda-sanm

170
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,293
Now, the match resumes.

171
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,129
lnakuma seems to be spacing
out a lfttle. Is she okay?

172
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,175
Begin !

173
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,845


174
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:24,142
Yawara lnokuma, you would have been happier
if you had stayed down back there

175
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,622
Telesh'ikova's ashi barai!

176
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,625
She hangs in!

177
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,710
lnokuma barely hangs in!

178
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,214
Teleshiikova continues with her sweeps!

179
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,008
Continuous sweeps just I'ilke
the match against Rockwell!

180
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,927
aways. . .

181
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,639
Ms. Rockwell, the ambulance is ready.

182
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,682
We'll bring in the stretcher right now.

183
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,688
Yawarra E

184
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,917
Jody!

185
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,877


186
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,712
Jody!

187
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,714
That stupid girl!

188
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,384
How much longer will she fight for revenge?!

189
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,885
Enough already!

190
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,971
Getting emotional so easily!

191
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,809
That's why you can be tricked
by an uranage and other stuff!

192
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,687
Master, what do you mean 'fightting for revenge?


193
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,189
She's getting serious because of Jody's injury!

194
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,482
HIuh?

195
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,234
She's not supposed to be serious?

196
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,444
Of course not!

197
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,088
Rockwell is gone?!

198
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,507
Whuille we weren't watching her....

199
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,092
We didn't expect her to leave with that beg...

200
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,637
Mo. . . Jody!

201
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,222


202
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,516
Jody !

203
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:29,768
Go!

204
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,102
Go look in the main hall!

205
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,159
Ya... wa...

206
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,952
Yawara E

207
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,194
Yukn!

208
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,489
Teleshikova's manage was yunko!

209
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,199


210
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,119
Telmh-ilkova takes it to a floor hold...

211
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,704
No, she doesn't

212
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,955
That was so close.

213
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:36,960


214
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,420
Man, that was close...

215
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,964
YBWaTEfCth can't do this...

216
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,092
No, she's just getting started.

217
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,969
Ri ght., lnokuma?

218
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,138
No!

219
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,764
I cant watch it anymore-l

220
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,100
We must watch!

221
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,226
But ..

222
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,938
We have to keep our eyes on her!

223
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,026
Imkurma-san is fighting so hard!

224
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,945
How can we not watch her?!

225
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,907
Dear, she wiIlll win, won't she?

226
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,910
Yawara wilt! surely win, wunl she?

227
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,125
While lnokuma has two yukns,

228
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,294
Teleshikova has one waza an and one yuko each.

229
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,212
TeleskamIa is heading in points.

230
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,922
Can hnok'ulma retaliate?

231
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,927
Anyway, YamashiTa-san, I'm impressed how
Inokuma hooked her foot and hung in there.

232
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,097
Yea that move Looked instinctive.

233
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,101
I'm really amazed at how fine-ruined
her move; are.

234
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:35,393


235
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,479
lnokuma maukas her moves aggressivenly!

236
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,398
It doesn't book like she's scared
of those manages at all!

237
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,701
Teleshillmva's ashi barm'!

238
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,536
hnokulma is in a pinch!

239
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,704


240
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,705
Yawara-sayn!

241
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,707


242
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:58,792
Yuxlm!

243
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,502
Tebeshlikma takes a yuko!

244
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,213
Anna Tehgsilkova of the Soviet
takes her second yukn!

245
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,715
She has pulled even further ahead iln points!

246
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,677
Yawara-san . . .

247
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,220
IInokuIma. . .

248
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,721
Inokumw sen. . .

249
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,181
Yawara-chan . . .

250
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,974
Yawaura. . .

251
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,877

252
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,670

253
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,758

00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,592
I"m with you too!

260
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,511
Mausudav-san, are you sure you're doing your job?

261
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,599
Fight!

262
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,021

264
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,444
My leg will heal again.

265
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,529
Then I will challenge you.

266
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,907
You are the best wrestler in the world!

267
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:54,991
Jody!

268
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,288
Watch this, Jody!

269
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,373

270
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,041
That ida'nt!

271
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,046
No, Telesikova's manage!

272
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,134
Jody !

273
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,308
Waza ari!

274
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,060
That was close-!

275
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,771
Imkuma's ouchi gari was anly a waza ari!

276
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,024
But now their points are tied!

277
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,275
Yawavra. . .

278
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,361
You're the best...

279
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,530


280
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:35,657
Jody !

281
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,491


282
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,660
Somebody get a stretcher!

283
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,788
She's done it!

284
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,582
She has overcome Teleshikova's uranage!

285
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,211
On tbsp of that, she retailiiavted with an ouchi gari!

286
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:54,676
Olh, Rockwell. who came to the main
hall dragging hm injured lag,

287
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,428
is now being carried out on a stretcher.

lnokuma, step forward!

291
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,610
Who will come out victorious in
the womenis free weight finals?

292
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,862
Telesh'ikova ar Inokuma?

293
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:19,659
Anyway, with that ouchi gari, lnokuxma
seems to be her normal selif, right?

294
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,871
Anyway, the final match is really heating up!

295
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,456
Jody!

296
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,874

298
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,211

Let go of me!

308
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,567
Yawara-san is performing
such a wonderful match!

309
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,277
What's so wanudnerful about that match?!

310
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:01,201
She's only taking revenge on that army
CUlt girl who injured Jody's keg!

311
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,702
This is not a match!

312
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,287
It's nothing more than a brawl.

313
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,580
Look at that!

314
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,874
Her eyes look We those of a fighting dog!

315
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,169
I:f she's that pissed, there's no way she
can property perform her mums!

316
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,549
But you cant fight wfthnout fighting spirit.

317
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,761
Yawarawsan is truuly wonderful rigwt nnw!

318

Dani canfuse anger and fighting spirit!

319
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,435


320
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,021
That's a passage from this book!

321
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,899
Oh, you have it too?

322
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,150
That's good.

323
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:34,484
That's good.

324
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,151
Let's see...

325
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,820


326
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,697
T'o Yamashitawk un,

327
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,951
The way of yawa-ra cannot be achieved in a day.

328
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,328
See?

329
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,830
You've got my autngraph.

330
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,084
T.Th-is is...

331
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:51,167
l'- This is...

332
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:51,334
FThis is...

333
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:51,418
T-This is. . .

334
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:51,501

T-This is. ..

337
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,673
So, what did I say about judo mastery?

338
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,678
The mind shall! be as quim
as a calm body of water,

339
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,180
and the move shall be as swift as a gust of wind.

340
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,265
That's right.

341
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,309
Right now, Yawara's mind is that
of a kid playing in a pool.

342
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,353
She's making a big splash.

343
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,607
I don't want any gold medals
From such a shameful mavtch!

344
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,150


345
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,234
Master !

346
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,736

Yoxu'tre my commentator!

349
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,157
Hey, Dilrectar, do something about him.

350
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,631
Damn! How tang is she going to continue
such a shameful! match!

351
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,468
Normally, she'd finish the match
immediately with an ilppon!

352
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,594
Master !

353
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,679
Let me go! Let me go!

354
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,347
No, I won't!

355
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,892


356
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:48,975


357
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:49,059


358
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:49,142


359
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:49,517


360
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:49,601


361
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:49,684
iv

362
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:49,809


363
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:49,893


364
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:50,060


365
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,143


366
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:50,393


367
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,879
Let me go, Yamashita!

368
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:23,802
I need to fix that stupid girl's
slacking spirit right now!

369
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,097
I know the mastery of judo you teach vefy welll!

370
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:31,267
But please let Yawara-san perform
her own judo for now!

371
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,271
I don't wlmt ham to shame my

372
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,273
um:

373
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,109
stop

374
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,068


375
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,570
such a matzh!

376
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:46,116


377
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:46,199


378
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:46,282
