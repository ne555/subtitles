00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,262
Dear Yawara-sama,

2
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,350
It was great to see you at the World Cup.

3
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,730
You must have gone back
to your rigorous training.

4
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,484
My leg is healing well.

5
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,238
I'm getting married to my fiance'.

6
00:01:53,238 --> 00:02:00,537
I would have to have you at my wedding, Yaw-Era.

7
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,082
Canada is far away but I would like you tn come.

8
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,460
Wow, Jody's Japanese is very good!

9
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,422
Mom, it's cold in Canada, right?

10
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,633
Yes, Canada is Canada.

11
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,262
I get to go to Canada - it's like a dream!

12
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,724
Going to the World Cup in Korea
was my first trip overseas,

13
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,101
but it dadnt feel like a trip at alL

14
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,854
It wiill be relaxing for you.

15
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,146


16
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,938
Yes!

17
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,397


18
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,817
Why don't you take wool pants?

19
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,485
No, Mom!

20
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,907
Yawa ra., dam: forget to train there.

21
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,367
Tranhiing?

22
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,953
There are fierce creatures in Canada!

23
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,750
People who knock down bears and
big trees with their bare hands.

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,419
There aren't people like that, are there?

25
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,505
Who knows? It's Canada!

26
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,760
Yawara, aren't you going to let
Jody see the gold medal?

27
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,262
No, I won't!

28
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,516
She courld've gotten the medal.

29
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,977
If yhe hadnt been injured...

30
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,103
That's right!

31
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,482
Winning the World Cup was just an accident.

32
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,483
Dom be arrogant!

33
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:11,775


34
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,693
I'm not arrogant!

35
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,152


36
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,487
Listen, Yawara!

37
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,031
Do not skip youwr training!

38
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,617
There isnt enough time until the Olympics!

39
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,953
She'll be fine. She wonT forget to train.

40
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,247
You are taking judo clothes, right?

41
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,249


42
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,292


43
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:34,255
Anyway, you"'ll start hellish training
as soon as you come back,

44
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,257
I'm going to get a haircut.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,134
Father?!

46
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,969
Aran't you gomg out with the medal?

47
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,890
Does he go out with it all the time?

48
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,643
Right... He's been doing it Lately.

49
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,603
No...! I'm so embarassed!

50
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,230
I don't want to go outside anymore!

51
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,523
It'll be okay.

52
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:56,236
His excitement will die down
while you're in Canada.

53
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,156
Right, I'm going tn Canada!

54
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:07,706


55
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,207
Canada?!

56
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,667
You're going to Canada?

57
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,251
Yes!

58
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,003
Really?

59
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,254
Thatls wonderful.

60
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,257
Jody invited me to her wedding.

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,927
Jody's wedding, is that so...

62
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,932
lit would better if she wasn't here while I...!

63
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,935


64
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,520


65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,691
You're going to do Judo? That's
reckless, Fujiiko'sain!

66
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,778
I'll do anything, if I can bring
mnakuma-san back to Judo!

67
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,949
I'll start a juudo club at my
college and I'll learn judo!

68
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:48,955
You have to have five people
in the team campetitinon.

69
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,539


70
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,168
Plus trainimg is harder than you can imagine.

71
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,212
I have thrown up and fainted many times.

72
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,843
Spra'ilns and broken tmnes are
common at tournaments.

73
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,928
Judo is a vary physical sport

74
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,179


75
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:04,346

126
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,597
What do you think about Sayaka san's Judo?

127
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,850


128
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,936
How dare you eat grapes in this sacred dojo!

129
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,938
That huuvrts!

130
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,276
Something is hitting my arm!

131
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:41,735


132
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,485

00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,487
Ouch! My ankle!

134
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,489
Tokunaga-san, Tokunaga-san...

135
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,450
it's Kojixro-san!

136
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,453
He: spitting the seeds.

137
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,581
Then let me clean--

138
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,249
Wa-i-t.

139
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,375


140
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:03,590
He's spitting the seeds at Sayaka-san's
weak points!

141
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,675
Innokuma Kojiro...

142
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,969
Sayaka's weak points are her left mm and right
foot. That's where the seeds are hitting.

143
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
No way,

144
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,598
it must be a coincidence!

145
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,602
Five Judo uniforms?

146
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,105
Just one for me today.

147
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,027
Are you going to start Judo, too?

148
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,112
Can you tell?

149
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,405


150
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,908
Many girls are like you lately.

151
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:30,909


152
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:35,330
You watched Inokuwma Yawara's
matches on TV, right?

153
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,956
Yes, of course I did!

154
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:45,090
Many girls were inspilred by her and have
come to my sure to buy Jtudo uniforms.

155
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,801
Is that so?

156
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,930
But Judo isn't easy.

157
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:59,688
Even lnoukuma Yawara has been
through tough training,

158
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,108
I think I can get more people!

159
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,693
Thanks!

160
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,696
There'll be people.

161
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,739
A lot of atmng people!

162
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,618
What if we win the Nationwide Competition?

163
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,517
Thanks for waiting. My class ran late.

164
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,355
No, no. from now on!

165
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,360
I wonder Iwnokuma-san has
gotten on the plane yet.

166
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,364
Grandpa, you didn't have to come to the airport!

167
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,866
What are you saying?

168
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,952
You are going to train in Canada!

169
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,620
No traiwnirng!

170
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,372
Calm down both of you.

171
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,209
Give me your bag.

172
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,379
I'll pass it to the bag handler.

173
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,923
You hurry up and get onboard!

174
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,466


175
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,842

177
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,139
You must have plenty of time to travel.

178
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,350
What would you do if something happened?

179
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,725


180
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,727

186
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,070


187
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,113

00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:54,761


196
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,846
Well, there's always tomorrow.

197
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,972


198
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,057
Excuse me...

199
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,479
Excuse me. . .

200
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,231


201
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,025
How long have you been sitting there?

202
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,110


203
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,529
About thirty minutes...

204
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,447
And I never noticed!

205
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,449
Many people have told me the same thing...

206
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,702
that I have very little presence.

207
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,706
I'm weak too.

208
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,209
Umm, could you tavllk a Little louder?

209
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:33,174
I"m so weak... I tend not to go to school.

210
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:33,591


211
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,885
Do you eat enough?

212
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,973
You have to eat! Spinach ar carrots!

213
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,016


214
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,018
Okay, I'm going home.

215
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,185
Be cheerful!

216
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:49,774
Well... I want to make myself strong...

217
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,525


218
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,945
You want people to join the judo club, right?

219
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,287
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,706

221
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,957

00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:13,131
I want to do judo and become strong...

223
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,591


224
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:29,522


225
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:29,606


226
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:29,689


227
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,400


228
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,362
Where is the exit?

229
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,696
Yawara!

230
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,072


231
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,074

00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,879


237
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,548
Oh! Spicy mentaiko!

238
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,842
I remember you hiked ix when you were in Japan!

239
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,304
It's very delicious! Open your mouth.

240
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,514
Here you go honey.

241
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,556

00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:10,522

00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,656


247
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,241
What's the matter, Yawara?

248
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,785
My judo gi...

250
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,623
Even when in Canada  you never forget to train.

251
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,377
I left it at home!

252
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,337
Grandpa must have put it in the bag.

253
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,673
It's delicious!

254
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,677
Amazing, spicy mentaiko from Fuguya
is the best in the world!

255
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,683
When you are designing clothing patterns,.

256
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,226
It'll be ok.

257
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,353
There will be people who want to join.

258
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,195
You're... from yesterday...

259
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,239
I'm Hikage Kyoko.

260
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,701
Everyone calls me "Kyon-Kyon the shadow"

261
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,660


262
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,372
I never noticed that she was in my class.

263
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,252
Are you going to wait for more
people to join again today?

264
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,964
Of course, I need at least S people.

265
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,343
Then, you need B more people.

266
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:26,348
I"m saying that we have to have
S people to join a tournament.

267
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,432


268
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:32,270
I'm saying that we need   more
people, you have me.

269
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,104


270
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,857
Are yau serious about judo?!

271
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,441


272
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,109
You! Be quiet.

273
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,861
Why are you tavllking to yourself?

274
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,113


275
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,074
The two of us were talking...

276
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,453
Jody, how is your leg?

277
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,329


278
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,456
No need to worry.

279
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,876
I'll get it compvleteiy healed and
then I want to win against you.

280
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,295


281
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,880
Jody, I...

282
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,841
Yawara, I'm sorry that I couldn't
keep our promise.

283
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,175


284
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,385
Promise?

285
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,219


286
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:08,723
I wasn't able to have a matth
with you at the Worhd Cup.

287
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,849
Jody. ..

288
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,725


289
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,062
But. I wi:l.l have a match with you next time!

290
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,772
So, will you forgive me?

291
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,357
No need to apolagize, Jody!

292
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,274


293
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,362
Im getting married and want to be like Joyner.

294
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,113


295
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,199
Her husband was her coach.

296
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,867
She was very good.

297
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,786
It's because of her husband!

298
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,871
But, I'm sad that she retired

299
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,539


300
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,251
My fianm is a weight lifing medalist.

301
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,296
He wmll become my personal trainer.

302
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,256
Really?

303
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,382
That's great!

304
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,384
You have a great person to
help you with your goals.

305
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,178
What are you saying? You have
Matsuda to help you!

306
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,472
What! I don't have anything to do with him.

307
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,642


308
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,352
You sure are lucky  Jody.

309
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,020


310
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:00,066
When you do judo, you are
surrounded by nice people.

311
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,987
For me... because of judo.
my family is all separated.

312
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,322
What are you saying?

313
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,783
You have Matsudamsan!

314
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:09,617


315
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,494
He has nothing to do with me!

316
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,039
Nothing?

317
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,456


318
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,957
Nothing!

319
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,339
Yawara-chan is in Canada?

320
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,381
Yuxp!

321
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:27,385
Her mom told me when I called her home.

322
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,678
Canada .

323
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,433
Jody is the motivation for Yawazra to do judo.

324
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,937
Yawara might want to continue judo!

325
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,732
You talk about her more than enough.

326
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,734
Eeeewwwwwwwll

327
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,152
What do you want?

328
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,862
What do I want?

329
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,614
You just touched my butt!

330
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,782
Me?!
You just touched my butt!

331
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,158
IFS not me!

332
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:50,909
Stnp lying.

333
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,244
Everyone, he's a pervert!

334
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,499
It's not me!

335
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,752
Believe me, I didn't do it!

336
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,420
Kosaku !

337
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,217
Why dun't you touch m-ilne instead?!

338
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,719
I didn't do anything!!!

339
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,097
Maybe it waan't you...

340
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,099
Thenn who did it?

341
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,228
How come I"m always a target?

342
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,647
What do you mean "How come?"

343
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,065


344
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,191


345
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:23,274


346
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:23,358


347
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:23,441


348
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:23,566


349
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,697
It's because of how you dress.

350
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,741
You're just asking to be touched by a pervert!

351
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,744
What do you think I should do?

352
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,455
Don't dress that way'!

353
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,082
Let's seem.

354
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,001
Why don't you learn self defense?

355
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,752
Judo, for instance.

356
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,629
Judo?

357
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,508
Do you think I can protect myself if I learn it?

358
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,134


359
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,260
Don't come dose to him!

360
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,343


361
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:50,468


362
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:50,719


363
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:50,969


364
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:51,136


365
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:51,219


366
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:51,344


367
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:51,469


368
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,227
Thank you very much.

369
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,569
No one came today.

370
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,862
Someone will.

371
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,280
There is tomorrow!

372
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,869
Tomorrow four more people will come.

373
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,328
We need three people..

374
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,545
I came to check an her... Ito Fujiko-sam

375
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,464
I know how you are feeling, but

376
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:33,345
all I can do is support you from the shadows.

377
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,389
How pathetic!

378
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,975
You are pathetic Hanazono Kaoru!

379
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,896
I must help her!

380
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,907
No one has come yet, Fujw'ko-sa-n..

381
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,075
Don't warry.

382
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,953
Nobody knew where we were. but today
people will know we are a jiundzo club.

383
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,830


384
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,583
Now anyone can tell that we are
members of the judo club.

385
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,959
Yes, that's right.

386
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,961
What are they doing?

387
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,089
Judo club.

388
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,048


389
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,717
Even if knokumwsan is popular...

390
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,094
I know!



391
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,097
The jlundao clothes are so boring.

392
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,392
No one can see the body Itine.

393
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,354
Yeah, you love tight Fitting claothes, Mari.

394
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,940
That's why you often become
the target of perverts.

395
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,108
Yeah, you're right.

396
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,902
Someone touched my butt on the train yesterday!

397
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:31,486


398
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,696
Again?

399
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,989
I don't know what to do.

400
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,951
Why do they want me?

401
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,994
I think it's because of my body!

402
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,497
Having sauch a beautiful body is a crime, isn't it?

403
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,415


404
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:43,540


405
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:43,873


406
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:43,998

All students! Have you ever been iIn
danger in your beautiful school life?

423
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:39,637
There are guys who want to attack
or harrass you, all around you.

424
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:47,187
Living by youwrsetf, walking alone at nights,
and ridang trains is not always safe!

425
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,105
Let me say this again.

426
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,483
You are often in danger.

427
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,734
Exactly.

428
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,362
I"m always a target.

429
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:57,447


430
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:57,614

00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:57,697


432
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:57,781


433
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:57,906


434
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:03,411
Hey, I am always targeted by perverts.

435
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,455
What should I do?

436
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,873

00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,586
