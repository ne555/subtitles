443
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:45,814
Winning against Belkens and Teleshikova,
Inokuma Yawara-san became number i .

444
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,692
I will not continue judo anymore.

445
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,320
Because of my jludo, my family is scattered.

446
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:06,376
Yawara-san, you have decided
to quit judo several times,

447
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,087
but you have always come back.

448
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:14,342
Yawara lnokurna. I came all this
way from Canada to see you.

449
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,094
Come on, l-et's fight.

450
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,512


451
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:17,595


452
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:17,679


453
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:17,762
For example, Jody Rockwell,

454
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:18,471
For example, Jody Rockwell,

455
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,640
For example, Jody Rockwell,

456
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,812
You would have quit judo a long
time ago, if you hadn't met her.

457
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,899
Shes Finally met her match.

458
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:35,572
Yaw-ara's encountered a strong opponent for
the filrst time, so she's actually enjoying it.

459
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,160
I've got you now!

460
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,502
Are you okay, Jody?

461
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,422
Fm okay.

462
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,802
lfs not good to worry about the apponenlt
dulring a match, Yawara.

463
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,304
Here I come!

464
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,901
Let's atop, Jody.

465
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,403
Your arm is seriously ilnj ured.

466
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:17,739
No!

467
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:23,536
Until now, I've never had so much fun doing judo.

468
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,248
Please, fight me, Yawaral

469
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,001
Yawara, please!

470
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:32,921
Jody. . .

471
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,970
This is the first time I've ever had fun, too.

472
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,263
So, next time...

473
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,099
Next time?

474
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:52,148
When your arm is headed, let's fight again, mkay?

475
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,650
At a competition somewhere.

476
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,487
R-Really? Yawara?

477
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,281
Yes. I promise.

478
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:06,204
You went to many competitions
in order to keep that promise.

479
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,455
Ippon.

480
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:08,331


481
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,916
uncredeb Ie.

482
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,293
She advances to the finals, just like that!

483
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,922
Coach Yuutenj'i. I didn't know she was this great!

484
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,384
President, then we have no problems
with her scholarship appointment?

485
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,302
Not even a problem!

486
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,639
Well! surely win a Barcelona Olympic
gold medal for our school!

487
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,724


488
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,393
My textbooks!

489
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:31,146
You went through my room again, didn't you?

490
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:32,147
Gear!

491
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,900
Give them back!

492
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,861
No.

493
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,531
Iit's useless to waste your time studying
all night long without sleeping.

494
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,532
Useless?

495
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,285
What's meless about my exam studies?

496
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:48,788
You're already set to enroll into Saikai College.

497
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,540
I'm going to Mitsuba Wamen's College!

498
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,499


499
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:56,629
Listen, I will never let you
go to that Mil-hm college!

500
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,048
l"l.l keep these textbooks.

501
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,925
Give them back to me!

502
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,390
Geez, I have to use up my month's
allowance for these.

503
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,642
And, I'm the one trying to budget
the family expenses, too.

504
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,606
Here he comes again,

505
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,400


506
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,402
that pervert Kazama tsuri.

507
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:28,620
"But, it is often difficult to distinguish a person:
true feeling," Tam Buchanan said to me.

508
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,247
That's perfect.

509
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,665
You're excellent, Yawaramaa-n.

510
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,794
No, you teach very well, Kazamatsuri-sazn.

511
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,088
No, you're very smart.

512
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,298
You won't have any prublems
getting into Mitsuba College.

513
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:41,966
I don't know.

514
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:45,720
But, Kazamartsuri-san, why are
you so good with English?

515
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,682
Once, I was very fascinated by the
works of a certain American poet.

516
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,060
I wanted to read the poems in the original
language, so I really studied English.

517
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,019
Poems?

518
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:57,273
"We loved with a love that was more than love.

519
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:02,195
She was a child and I was a child.

520
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:06,449
In this kingdom by the sea,

521
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,370
But we loved with a low that
was more than haven"

522
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,542
Just a few lines from Edgar
Allen Poe's "Annabel Lee-l"

523
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:21,965
Like this poem, l"nm probably booking...
for that single, eternal woman to love.

524
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,801
Or something like that.

525
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,720
Was that a Little plretentinus?

526
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,555
Nat real'ly. . .

527
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:32,851
Geez!

528
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,561
What are they doing?

529
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,312
It's been over   hours now! B hours!

530
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,189
M....Ma-tauda-san, I cant breathe!

531
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:38,732


532
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,943
Damn, that Kazama-tsuri!

533
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,278
Don't tell me...

534
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,572
Studs are so lucky.

535
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,823
You idiot!

536
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,283
Don't think so nasty!

537
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,868
You were thinking the same
thing as well, Ma:tS'Unda-san..

538
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,619


539
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,287
Yes?

540
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,163


541
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,457
Shin-Chan. It's me!

542
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,375
Holy! bah-Marika!

543
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,461
Last time was so good!

544
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:02,464
I've been thinking about you ever since then.

545
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:02,714


546
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,966
I...I'm grateful for an your help!

547
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,217
Can I'?

548
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,177
Oh sure.

549
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,720
Can I come over now?

550
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,221
Oh really?

551
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:10,972


552
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,432
ND!

553
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,016
T

554
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,685
I... I'm bedridden with a really
bad headache right now.

555
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:16,686
Maybe next time?

556
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,104
Umm, HI...

557
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,105
Yes?

558
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,440
Make some tea.

559
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,402
Tea, huh?

560
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,363
Oh no!

561
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:32,035
The cup with the lipstick stain of White Lily
College girl, Megulmi, is still in the kitchen.

562
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,870
Helho? Shin-Chan?

563
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,204


564
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,163
Oh, there's a culp.

565
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,790
Hey, that's okay.

566
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,208
You must be tired from doing
jludo and exam studying.

567
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,584
You must be tired from doing
jludo and exam studying.

568
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,251
You must be tired from doing
judo and exam studying

569
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:44,714
I"m actually very energized. I'm not tired at all.

570
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,967
No, no. Just sit there.

571
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,720
You're very mice, Kazanmavtsulri-san.

572
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:03,149
Come ocn, let's get back to studying
again, Yawara-sam!

573
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,153
Kazanm'a-tsuxrir-san !

574
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:07,862


575
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,323
Let's take your friend out to eat with us....

576
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,496
That was divine retribution.

577
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,456


578
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:22,752
We have much bigger and happier n-ews!

579
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:28,383
Our only daughter, Sayaka,
and Kazamatxu ri--kun. . .

580
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,804
are now engaged!

581
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:33,638
What?

582
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,935
W...wa;it.

583
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,438
This is a very happy outcome!

584
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:45,442
Shinnoswke, now our Kazamatsuxri
Brewery is in wife hands.

585
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,110
Serves you right!

586
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,154
So, that means...

587
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,406
Wait, everyone --

588
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,116
This is Sayaaka.

589
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:57,746
To be engaged to Kazanmatsuri-san
is the happiast even-t for me.

590
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:04,669
But, i:n order to have a bILissful
marriage, I mmt do one thing.

591
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:11,134
That is, to defeat Inokuma Yawara,
and become Number One in Japan!

592
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,552
Bun.

593
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:22,729
I... I was the only one thinking we had something.

594
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,815
Kazanmavtsulril-san,

595
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,817
Fm... such a fool!

596
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:35,158
And then, the day of the exam came.

597
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,078
Yau sprained your hand in yesterday's match?

598
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,164
I can't hold a pencil because it hurts so much.

599
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,169
I think I barely made it through
the morning exam,

600
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,880
but the pain numbs my brain...

601
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,090
I dun? think I can make it anymore.

602
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,471
I need to go.

603
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,264
You're going to take ft with that hand?

604
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,814
Yawara-saun .

605
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,193
I studied so hard for this.

606
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,570
Regardless of the result. ! won't give up.

607
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,406
l"ll duo my best until the very end.

608
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,573
But, with that handu.

609
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,910
At worsta rll go to Savikai College.

610
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,330
Matsuda-san, the-t choice will be great
news mantena-l for you, right?

611
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,299
Give me your right hand.

00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,094
Just give me your right hand.

613
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:53,403
There was a tennis player who won at Wixmbelsdaon
by tyilng the racket tn her injured hand"

614
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,780
Here you go.

615
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,742
It looks dumb, but it"s better than
not being able to hold a pencil.

616
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:03,038
Give your all in me Last fro-minute bout.

617

Yawara, are you not home yet:!?

00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,714
That girl, breaking curfew again!

622
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,970
Yawara just called earlier.

623
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,723
She's working an a report with her friend.

624
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,519
Are you sure she didn't go to a disco?

625
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,020
NmNn.

626
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,148
I doubt that.

00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:20,490

Jigoro-san's guess was an the money.

645
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,087
The World Cup was coming up,

646
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:34,295
The World Cup was coming up;

647
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:34,379
The World Cup was coming up:

648
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:34,462
The World Cup was coming up:

a college student".

652
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,023
What is that girl doing'n

653
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:02,782
The one who brought you back to judo is...

654
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:03,658
What?!

655
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,117


656
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,703
Hue touched yowr bottom!

657
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,246


658
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:11,916
So I jlust tried to brush him off...

659
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,543
Brush him off?

660
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:16,796
Jtust brushing cuff caused a person
to fly through the aiur?

661
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:18,256
It was an accident.

662
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:22,093
He accidently tripped right then.

663
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,307
IsnT that judo?

664
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:32,020
Oh, what are you talking about?

665
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,189
What is this jlundn thing?

666
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:39,569
IInokunma-san, I reaullly think
I have seen you before.

667
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:40,779


668
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:44,074
Back then, just after being forced
to give up on being a ballerina,

669
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,077
I was living at my home in Shizuoka without
being able to find any new goals,

670
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,080
and I was just spacing out in front of the TV.

671
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,208
Another llppon-zeai I

672
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,420
She was glowing incredibly.

673
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,799
I didn't know a thing about judo, but I would tell,

674
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:05,512
that she is a gift who wi-ll become the best in the
world - the very thing I was trying to achieve.

675
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,722
Thank you, lncnkuma-san!

676
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:12,143
I decided to give my days of youth
a try again because of you.

677
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:12,560


678
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,357
I realized that I shouldn't just sit there
when I saw you shining so brightly.

679
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:20,402
I decided to give my best at the entrance exam.

680
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,570
This is so excitilng!

681
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,114
You are that giri!

682
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,950
I have a Friend who will became the wodd's best!

683
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:47,971
I really wanted to dance for the world.

684
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,934
But you can!

685
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:59,691
Von can make my unfulfilled dream a reality!

686
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:05,530
Yawara-san decided to compete
in the World Cup.

687
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,577
M...Ma...Ma...

688
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,287
..Ya...

Ya...

689
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,090
It's not about to stop anytime soon.

690
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:25,592
YES.

691
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,016
That newspaper reporter.

692
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:37,604
Yawara, it might get difficult for you, but your
steady boyfriend will help you through it all.

693
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,023
What? You have no one, and yet
you don't want to meet anyone.

694
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,775
You're zs already.

695
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,651
Start thinking about it.

696
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,570
I have someone in mind;

697
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,491
Let me check the weather.

698
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:55,705


699
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,832
I have someone in mind;

700
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,836
She's going to be in the World cup.

Well, I'll be in Seoul tomorrow.

704
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,226
It's finally time.

705
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,562
Huh? Yeah. H! be waiting for
you there, Yawara-san.

706
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:20,647
YES.

707
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,566
Actua-Illy, my Dad seems to be in Seoul.

708
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,571
Really? I hope you can meet him!

709
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:35,328
Yawara-savn.

710
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:36,746
Yes?

711
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,000
After the Worid Cup...

712
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:46,006
After the Wodd Cup...

713
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:58,226
Umm. . .

714
00:41:58,226 --> 00:41:59,227

715
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,897

716
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:04,190

00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:09,487
I"l.l catch up with her. Excuse me.

719
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:13,992
After the Wodd Cup...?

720
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:14,451


721
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,454
U'h, well...

722
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:21,124
I wanted to reserve a special interview...

723
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,335


724
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:26,463
Ma-tsuda-san, you're always about wark.

725
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,089


726
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:29,674
Please excuse me.

727
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:35,305
Todo-san.

728
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,432


729
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:41,102
After the World Cup...

730
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:55,658

731
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:12,676
Fujiikn-sem. . .

732
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,303
Peace!

733
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:22,644
You left for Seoul and stepped
out onto the World's Stage.

734
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:27,982
By the way, Jigoro-san. Is what you
said in the commentator box true?

735
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:30,777
The reason Yawara-san's father.
ch'iiro-san is missing,

736
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:35,198
is due to the shock of being thrown
by S-yealr-ohd Yawaravsan.

737
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,200
Dan't tallk about that!

738
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,036
But if that's true, it's so drama-tic.

739
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,416
So I really was the reason.

740
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,084
The reason he's gone...

741
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:57,721
It was w years ago.

742
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:03,601
By losing to Yamashfta-kum, I realized
the toughness of judo once again.

743
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:07,731
And I leamed what I was missing.

744
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:11,234
It's the natural born talent

745
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:21,786
And I didn't realizza someone with a natural
born talent was so close to me.

746
00:44:24,664 --> 00:44:28,710
But that day, she wrely performed a throw.

747
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:32,130
I knew I was thrown.

748
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,342
By my mere five year old daughter!

749
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,724
We heard that story.

750
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:46,644
From Yarwam-saan. She told
me with such a sad face.

751
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:50,899
The shock was not from beilng
thrown by Yawara...

752
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:57,947
By seeing her true talent, I...

753
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,492
I was... truly touched.

754
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:06,206
And so you left for a journey of training,"

755
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:15,340
Kojiro-san, where are you?

756
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:34,317
I took apart your father's judo
gi, and sewed it up again.

757
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:36,319
I'm glad I cauald finish it before you left.

758
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,071
Dads?

759
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:45,787
lit was Dads dream to become the
best judo wrestler in the wand.

760
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:54,170
I wonder if I can see him in Seoul?

761
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,006
rm sure you can.

762

00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,152
Young Lady,

778
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:28,371
You ruled all other sports, but
you could not rule Judo.

779
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:32,959
Holding back is not good for you.
Cry to your heart's content.

780
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,878
As inf I wauww cry!

781
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:39,049
The only time I will cry is when
I beat hnokuma Yawara,

782
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:41,634
and after becoming the true queen of the world,

783
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,095
I will cry for joy!

784
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:47,390
How could I dare cry until then? How could I....

785
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:54,689
Looks like I was right at judging you
as the damned rival of Yawara,

786
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:57,609
Lady, you will get much stronger!

787
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:05,700
Read that and study a lot!

788
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,204
And get much, much, very much stronger,

789
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:11,456
and come back to face Yawawra!

790
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,458
As the strangest rival in exmance.

791
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:17,087
Wait and see, lnokuma Yawara!

792
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:19,673

Stop talking nonsense!

Do you think yau can get a gold medal
at the Olympics with that attitude?

799
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:05,427
It has nothing to do with me.

800

We are starting youxr training right now and
we're going to fix your loser attitude.
