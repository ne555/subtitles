00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,430
I've loved him.

I've always been waiting.

I showed off whenever he was around.

My career and love life?

I do think they're both important.

I know it's what I want the most.

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,950
H-Hey, Jody.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,500
What's with the crowd?

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,510
Nothing's with the crowd, Yawara!

24
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,860
You were the World Cup's gold medalist.

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,380
A little Japanese girl.

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,630
Canadians were cheering for you on TV.

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,810
B-But...

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,690
Yawara!

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,680
She is number one judo girl, Yawara!

30
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,650
Number one!

31
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,880
Don't be shy. Wave to the crowd.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,620
But...

33
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,160
Come on!

34
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,330
Yawara!

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,660
Yawara!

36
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,630
The Last Ippon Seoinage!?

37
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,330
Here they come!

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,940
They're my students from the judo school.

39
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,140
They're so cute.

40
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,910
Yawara!

41
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,110
Oh dear, everyone.

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,110
She will have a practice game on our wedding day!

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,370
Hm? What did he say?

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,790
What was he talking about?


45
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:12,210
He said that you'll do a match for us at our wedding ceremony.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,960
Miss Rockwell, is that true?

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,090
Can we really see a match with Yawara here in Canada?



48
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,930
I can't participate, since I'm still recovering,

49
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,740
but I have the perfect opponent prepared for Yawara.


50
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,890
Jody, I...

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,940
Yawara, will you throw an amazing Ippon Seoinage for us?

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,580
Jody, I...

53
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,030
Yawara!

Good night.

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,970
Man...

57
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,840
This company really works my fingers to the bone...

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,930
I haven't gotten much sleep in the past three days.

59
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,950
Wh-What?!

60
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,050
Wh-When did this story come in?

61
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,910
Hm? What's the fuss?

62
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,610
What do you mean, "fuss"?

63
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,670
Yawara-san!

64
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,250
Inokuma Yawara's doing an exhibition match in Canada!

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,100
Yes!

66
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,660
Thank you so much, Jody!


67
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,720
This is good.

68
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,170
Yawara will finally return to judo.

69
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,640
What are you looking at, mister?

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,930
Excuse me, miss.

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,150
Is this the new recruit?

72
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,870
Yes...

73
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,570
U-Um...

74
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,540
Oh, don't point like that.

75
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,670
Call me "Marilyn."

76
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,160
I also...

77
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,830
Anyway, can you make sure that my gi fits my body perfectly?

78
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,080
I need to show off my body, okay?

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
Sh-Show off your body?

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,980
Anyway, I'm only starting judo to protect this body,



81
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,220
so I don't want any scratches or bruises on it.

82
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Come here.

83
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,800
No way.

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,690
I thought so.

85
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,730
Judo's not an easy sport.

86
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,000
What on earth can you possibly do with a girl who doesn't want scratches or bruises,

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,250
and a girl who's so frail a stiff wind could knock her over?

88
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,740
B-But... I want to improve my health.

89
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,550
Yeah!

90
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,210
What am I supposed to do if I get hurt?

91
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,480
No offense, but just give up.

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
I won't!


93
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,990
Don't you know it'll be your fault if something happens to me?

94
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,330
This is hopeless.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,700
I can't make a team to bring Inokuma-san back to judo.

96
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,160
Inokuma-san...

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,840
That makes thirteen of them!

99
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,620
Why?

100
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,230
Why do I have such bad luck?

101
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,790
Men are... Men are...

102
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,610
assholes!


103
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,090
Four more people...

104
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,580
Four more...

105
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,310
They'll come...

106
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,500
Four amazing judoists.

107
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,480
I'm sure of it.

108
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,020
She's...

109
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,990
She's staring at the recruiting poster with such intensity,

110
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,490
I can feel her spirit coming out of her back.

111
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,700
You're the one!

112
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,490
I've been waiting for someone like you!

113
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,910
I swear I'll throw you!

114
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,450
You're in for a surprise if you think I'll go down easy!

115
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,410
I'll teach you not to mess with me!

116
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,410
Sh-She <i>is</i> the one!

117
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,200
Do you want to learn judo?

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,660
Hell yeah.

119
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,710
I'll throw down every single man on earth!

120
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,930
That's the spirit!

121
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,590
Hey, do you have any experience?!

122
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,700
Well?!

123
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,890
Experience?

124
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,730
O-Of course I do.

125
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,240
How much?

126
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,330
Hey, how much?

127
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,150
Th-Thirteen...

128
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,350
Thirteen years?

129
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,210
Woohoo!

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,430
Hallelujah!

131
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,560
A savior at last!

132
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,170
Hurrah!

133
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,630
Inokuma-san, an amazing judo team is waiting for your return!

134
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
Here they come!

135
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,090
Yay!

136
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,640
Jody!

137
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,650
Congratulations, Jody.

138
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,650
Yawara!

139
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,180
You look absolutely beautiful!

140
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,090
Thank you, Yawara.

141
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,120
Is your foot okay?

142
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,910
Oh, this is nothing.

143
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,330
I have him to support me.

144
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,620
You're such a lucky woman.

145
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,950
Make sure you put on a wedding dress yourself and cozy up with Matsuda.

146
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,950
Maâ€”

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,870
A-A dream?

148
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,560
What a beauty she is...

149
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,040
Yawara-san looked gorgeous in her wedding dress.

150
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,600
And I was right next to her.

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,980
Then the honeymoon...

152
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,280
Then...

153
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,840
the first night.

154
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,460
I want to see what happens next.


155
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,580
Ah, snap out of it!

156
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,750
This must be happening to me because I've been locked up in this place, living like a priest!

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,120
It's before dawn.

158
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,620
The dojo's lights are on.

159
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,380
Sayaka-san, what a busy bee you are.

160
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,290
S-Such intensity...

161
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm sure of it.

162
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,300
He must be!

163
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,770
He's Master Inokuma Jigoro's son, and Yawara-san's father:

164
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,600
Master Inokuma Kojiro.

165
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:07,820
Hey!



166
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,510
It's pointless to try and hide.

167
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,270
I noticed you when you walked in.

168
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,290
I'd like to tell you just one thing.

169
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,800
P-Please tell me anything, Master Inokuma Kojiro.

170
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,800
The egg I have for breakfast...


171
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,610
I'd like the yolk a little softer.

172
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,320
Okay...

173
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,720
What do you think, Yawara?

174
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,950
Isn't it an amazing dojo?

175
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,350
Your opponent is amazing too!

176
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,320
Jody...

177
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,360
She couldn't enter the World Cup because of an injury,

178
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,920
but she's the new hope of Canada!

179
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,940
Jody, please listen to me.

180
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,930
Ladies and gentlemen!

181
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,910
I know we're all having so much fun,

182
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:25,090
but let's have one of our wonderful guests celebrate RenÃ© and Jody's marriage.

188
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,870
Yawara!

189
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,210
Yawara!

190
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,870
Yay, Yawara!

191
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,030
Yay!

192
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,430
I'm so excited!

193
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,090
Jody...

194
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,840
Hey, come here, Yawara.

195
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,230
Jody, I...

196
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,840
Don't worry about a thing.

197
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,020
Look, she's super strong, you know?

198
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,810
After all, she was supposed to represent Canada for the 72kg competition in the World Cup.

199
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,860
The poor thing dislocated her right shoulder right before the World Cup trial.

200
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,210
She wanted to go to the World Cup,

201
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,320
so I want to give her the chance to fight you, Yawara!

202
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,210
Jody, I've already quitâ€”

203
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,630
Yawara!



204
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,670
Will you please give it your best for her sake?

205
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,620
Jody...

206
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:50,100
Yawara Inokuma will be facing our very own rising star, Kristin Adams!

207
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,750
Go get her!


208
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,350
So she's Yawara Inokuma.

209
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,900
The Yawara who won the World Cup.

210
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,910
I can finally fight her... the great Yawara!

211
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,790
Jody...

212
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,860
Step forward.

213
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,880
Bow.

214
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,840
Go! Go! Yawara!

215
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,820
Jody, I really can't...

216
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,750
Note: "Hajime" means "Begin." It is used in dojos world-wide.
Hajime!

217
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,400
Let's fight, Yawara!

218
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,720
Jody...

219
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,420
Yawara!

220
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,030
Why do we have to carry these tatami mats?

221
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,370
Fujiko-sama, we need to find more members.

222
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,430
I don't want to build muscles from carrying something so heavy.

223
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,880
Hey, Kyonkyon, are you really doing your part?

224
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,550
I-I'm sorry.

225
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,470
I'm doing my best already.

226
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,010
Excuse me, you... um...

227
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,820
Me?
Excuse me, you... um...

228
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,850
I'm Yoko.

229
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,930
Minamida Yoko.

230
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,410
Minami as in "South,"

231
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,280
Da as in "paddy fields,"

232
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,870
and Yoko as in "sun."

233
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,850
I see.

234
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,310
Miss Paddy-field.

235
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,860
Don't call me that!

236
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,740
I heard you've been practicing judo for thirteen years.

237
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,330
What's so funny?

238
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,430
It's just...

239
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:46,390
Fujiko-san told me that you were an amazing person with thirteen years of experience,

240
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,650
but you were just infuriated from being dumped by thirteen men?

241
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,620
If you don't stop laughing, you're really going to pay!

242
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,850
But it's really funny!



243
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,790
They run away because you chase them, you know?

244
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,360
All I have to do is leave them alone, and they come after me.

245
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,420
You'll never know what I went through!

246
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,320
You're just a slut!

247
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,300
Then shall I introduce you to your fourteenth boyfriend?

248
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,690
At least put a shirt on under the gi!

249
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,960
No wonder men come after you!

250
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,390
E-Excuse me.


251
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,340
Let's carry the tatami.

252
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,900
There!

253
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,950
There!

254
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,080
Oh no! I can't believe I did that!

255
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,350
Well, it curved a little.

256
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,960
There's no one good in the recreational tennis club,

257
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,860
nor in the recreational golf club, of course.

258
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,860
Where will I find anyone who can do judo?

259
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,700
Oh, I'm so sorry!

260
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,610
I finally found a person with thirteen years of judo experience,

261
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:10,360
but with a twig like Kyonkyon and that pervert Marilyn...

262
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,170
It doesn't even make a difference!

263
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,560
Oh, my God!

264
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,210
Where are you throwing?

265
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,310
It's going into the street!




266
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,230
Fight! Fight!

267
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,370
Wow! Kristin's combination moves from the inside to the outside are bringing Yawara to her knees.

268
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,720
She's...

269
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,710
She's also...

270
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,190
strong!

271
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,640
One, two, one, two...

272
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,810
One, two, three, four!

273
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,090
One, two, one, two...

274
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,150
One, two, three, four!


275
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,660
I couldn't possibly find anyone amazing in a jazz dancing group.

276
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,210
I need to make the judo team look more official before Inokuma comes back from Canada.

277
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,550
Just one more...

278
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,720
I just need one more person who might be able to do judo.

279
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,350
No more.



280
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,570
I can't go on a diet. No way.

281
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,790
W-Water...

282
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,140
F-Food...

283
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:52,980
Parfait, hamburgers, cod roe, spaghetti, daifuku mochi, fried chicken, chicken bowl...

284
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm sorry. I can't move.

285
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,670
I look tired, don't I?

286
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,640
This is fine!


287
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,170
Keep me pinned to the ground.

288
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,200
Please... feed me something.

289
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,580
I can't get out.

290
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,420
This is perfect!

291
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,180
Keep me pinned down!

292
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,750
Inokuma-san!

293
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,820
I've found her!

294
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,100
I've found an amazing person!

295
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,840
Anything...

296
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,420
Please, give me food.

297
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,690
I've found one!

298
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,250
Feed me.

299
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,450
Jody...

300
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,950
I'm sorry to spoil your wedding ceremony,

301
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,910
but this match is mine!

302
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,510
Ippon!

303
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,970
That was awesome!

304
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,410
That very last Ippon Seoinage!

305
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,780
It was awesome, Yawara!

306
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,660
Superb!

307
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,740
Number one, Yawara!

308
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,020
Ji-Jigoro-san...

309
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,590
Isn't... Isn't that a gold medal?

310
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,180
My, what's this?

311
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,100
I put it on when I was cleaning, and I forgot to put it away!

312
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,970
Man, it looks amazing whenever I see it.

313
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,560
Right, dear?

314
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,780
Yes, truly.

315
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,320
What an amazing thing.

316
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,060
What are you doing?

317
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,110
Well...

318
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,730
So long.


319
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,630
For goodness' sake.

320
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,650
Could you stop flattering him about that medal?

321
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,430
It puts him on a high horse.

322
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,660
B-But it's not like I have a choice!

323
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,130
H-He doesn't go home until I say something about the medal.

324
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,570
Why does he have to come every day?

325
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,620
The new owner of the dry-cleaning place told me that

326
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,150
he even wears that medal to the next town's marketplace.

327
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,130
What a shameless man...

328
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,220
Hey, it's the medal geezer!

329
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,610
Take that!

330
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,060
Take care, Yawara.

331
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,620
Thank you.

332
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,360
You gave me so many gifts.

333
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,670
Oh, no.

334
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,580
It was a wonderful ceremony, thanks to you.

335
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,250
Give my regards to Master Jigoro.

336
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,900
Yeah.

337
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,960
And let's meet at Barcelona, okay?

338
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,850
What's wrong, Yawara?

339
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,460
I'm sorry, Jody.

340
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,330
That can't be true!

341
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,990
You can't really be quitting judo!

342
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,830
Tell me it's not true!

343
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,890
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 523 Days

344
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,510
Yawara!

345
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,550
She's still not home?

346
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,700
That girl better not have lost to a mere bear in Canada and became its meal!

347
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm sorry.

348
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,820
I'm sorry, Jody.

349
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,250
Hey, tall girl, I'll train the new judo team you put together.

350
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,980
However, my training is pretty strict.




351
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,280
Grandpa, what are you talking about?

352
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,740
Next time on Yawara:

353
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,840
The weakest Japanese judo team.

354
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,000
The Weakest Japanese Judo Team
The weakest Japanese judo team.

355
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,330
Hey, Grandpa, what are you talking about?
The Weakest Japanese Judo Team

356
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,790
The Weakest Japanese Judo Team

357
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,710
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

358
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:47,030
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
