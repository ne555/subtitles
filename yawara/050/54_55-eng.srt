1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,190
She... she did it!

2
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,151
Inokuwma Yawara wan the world cup!

3
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,408
I like you!

4
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,370
You...

5
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,312
Good job.

6
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:50,170
You truly are a superstar, Yawara-san.


7
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,049
A thief! Somebody stop him!

8
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,051


9
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,344
Move it! Move it!

10
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,264
Get out of my way!!

11
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,101


12
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:05,810
Camera. . .

13
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,353
Right:

14
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:17,822


15
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,157
Amazing!

16
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,544
Te... Terrific...!

17
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:37,967
I've been following you ever since I was
mesmerized by your flash of talent

18
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,678
Not just me either...

19
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,555
I'm really bored.

20
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,266
Please stop playing around, Miss.

21
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,185
Miss!

22
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:53,900


23
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,944
P-P'laase forgi...

24
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,281
Were you injured?

25
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:00,615


26
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,952
You threatened our lives. Who are you?

27
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,287
Did you know that Fm Inokumua Jigoro?

28
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,373
A-Absolutely not. Really, I have no excuse.

29
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:12,877
I was careless and wasn't keeping
my eyes on the road.

30
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:19,009
It was fate that the queen of
sports, Sayaka, met Yawara.

31
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:19,592


32
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:25,015
Oh, these are splendid trophies.

33
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,269
They were awarded to you, young lady?

34
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,147


35
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,524
This quInik! !!

36
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,358
Junk! Junk!

37
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,277
All j-unxk!

38
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,486
Junk!

39
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,871
Miss, they're comphetely destroyed.

40
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,583
Winning has no value to me.

41
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,252
The issue is how excited they can make me.

42
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,465
Buta I have nothing to get excited about.

43
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,677
Those who are given only one ability by God,
they do not Ulndemtand how baring it is.

44
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:07,390
I hate that God has given me not
only two, but three abilities.

45
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,855
We-IL judo was not among them?

46
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,857
J udo?

47
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,742
Did I surprise you, Miss?

48
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,868


49
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,372
There will be more suwrp'ises.

50
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:35,585
I know a girl who is much stranger than
lam. She's the same age as you are.

51
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,795
Eh?

52
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,048
Jignro lnokuma, it's been a month.

53
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,803
WhQn you see the results of my hard training,
you'll tell me the whereabouts of the girl.

54
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,848
Eut I wonder if I've become stronger than her.

55
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,683


56
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,267
I'm late. I'm late.

57
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,770
Ah. Sayaka-san.

58
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,564
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

59
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,066
W'a-iut.

60
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,402
I'm sure you know her too.

61
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,695
What are you taLkixng about?

62
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,280
You know the identity of the
really strung girl, don't you?

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,533
Pm reality in a hurry!

64
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,701
I have a test!

65
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,037
I will not let you hide that inlfarmlalzinn from me.

66
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,123
Please release mue!

67
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,208
If you dont tell me, you"l'l get hurt.

68
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,043
You want me to show you the
results of my hard training?

69
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,044


70
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,629
Come of? fit.

71
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,715
l"l.l miss my bus!

72
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,550
You will get hurt unlesa you
are prepared for my attack.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,301
Enough... is... enough!
You will get hurt unless you
are prepared for my attack.

74
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,181
I'm really in a hurry!

75
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,599
That's the gm.

76
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,436
That's the giiri who is extraordinarily strong.

77
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,438


78
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,983
Not only did she beat my perfectly
executed mweV

79
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,153
She also saw me without my fake tooth.

80
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,280
Miss Sayaka became even more
passionate about Judo.

81
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,781
Just you wait!

82
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,241
Why?!

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,204
Why don't you debut in the jawdn
world when you are so skilllled?

84
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,415
Why are you trying to hide your talent?

85
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,332
I'll cry out! . l"lll make a big noise!

86
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,418
I became more passionate too.
I'll cry out! - I'El make a big noise!

87
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,379
I beg of you! Please answer me,
even if it's just one word!

88
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,174
I'm betting my career as a reporter on you.

89
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,425
Please leave me alone!

90
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,384
Leave her alone.

91
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:12,849
Kazama tsuri Shinnosuke, Sayaka's coach.

92
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,936
You have no right to violate her
privacy or to collect material.

93
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,523


94
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,402


95
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:24,569


96
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,198
Who was that guy?

97
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,284
Is that man a reporter from a photo magazine?

98
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,202
Whautl?

99
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:37,540
No... I thought you might be a popular idal singer
or something and were being fella-wed.

100
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:37,832


101
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,210
An idol? Me !?

102
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,544
No, not at all!

103
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,131
I'm also invad-iing your privacy.

104
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:45,715


105
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,511
That's only because ymu're dazzling!

106
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,846


107
00:07:51,846 --> 00:08:01,356
Because of this perverted stalker,
the situation changed.

108
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:07,737


109
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,698
No way, a TV aation?

110
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,533
Did y'uu meet anyone famous?

111
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,328
I met and talked with Sugilmura Haruko-san
and Taukamine Misha-sun.

112
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,289
They were more beautifui in person than on TV.

113
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,835
Did you see S'honen-ta-i or Genji Hmkaru?

114
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,878
We no interest in school boy groups;

115
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,507
By the way, why dnl'd you go to the
TV station in the first place?

116
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,718
Prumotjng yonu, of course.

117
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,010
What? Promoting me?!

118
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,093
What? Promoting me?!

119
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:30,218
What? Promoting me?!

120
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,012
What? Promoting me?!

121
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:32,470


122
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,224
The best wary to glamorousaly promote
youlr debut is through TV, so...

123
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,726
I can't beHeve it!

124
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,022
But, Osh-iuri TV rejected it.

125
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,232
Hnow coulld they refuse such juicy material?!

126
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:44,524


127
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,734
Of course!

128
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,945
Please don't do such stupid things anymore!

129
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,741
I have no ilntentian of entering the fuck: world.

130
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,368
I'm finally able to be like a normal girl and...

131
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,913
"A normal girl..." and what, get a guy?

132
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,790


133
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,254
Remember, Yawara, that in any warld, idols
don't get careless and get boyfriends.

134
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,967
Getting the National Achievement Award means
that you'll be the indol fozr adll Japanese citizens.

135
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,220
And so, an idol like that can't possibly
have a boyfriend get in the way.

136
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,807
I diam: want to be everyonek gilrl,

137
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,893
I just need to be one man's gvirl.

138
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,226


139
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,480
No more! Fm never going to dn judo, ever!

140
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,484
Yawara, in your body flows the
blood of a judo athlete...

141
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,234


142
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,613
You can't quit, even if you try!

143
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:31,988


144
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,492
Hmph, who cares about the blood
of a judo athlete. Not fair!

145
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,996
l was forced to do judo ever
since I coulld remember.

146
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,206


147
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:41,915
Who's there?

148
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,751
You're the newspaper repartenr agaiin, aren't you!

149
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,336


150
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,964
Okay, that's it! How dare you
invade my home and peep!

151
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,384
iv f n

152
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,677
What's happening, Yawara?

153
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,596
A peeping tom! He was spying on our dojo!

154
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,099


155
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,308
You thug!

156
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,478


157
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:03,561

Ta-da!

166
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:11,403
The Daiiy Every Sports' Matsuda Kosaku
has finally captured the decisive scene!

167
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,029
I got great shots, Matsuda-san!

168
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:13,321


169
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:17,534
And to throw Sayaka Hon'ami's coach and pin
him with an arm-crushing cross body lock,

170
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,244
it's an overwheLming scoop!

171
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,288
lnokumna Yawara
Super-idol Surfaces!

172
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,000


173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,043


174
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,628
When is your debut match?

175
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
Please get out of my way!

176
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,548
Why were you hiding youself all this time?

177
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,466
Whafs your relationship with Han'ami Sayak'a?

178
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,260
There's none!

179
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,720
What about Shinwnosuke Kazamatsuri?

180
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,060
What's wrong. aren't you gonna eat?

181
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,269


182
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,604
If you don't eat, you wan't become strong!

183
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,400
I don't care about becoming wrung,

184
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,154
When did yuu start doing jludo?

185
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,281
I don't know.

186
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:02,078
But, I do remember stomach-throwing
my father when I was five years old.

187
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,956
I wanted to be praised by everyone.

188
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,207
Five years old?!

189
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,003
Of course, grandpa was overjoyed,

190
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:14,924
but at that time, it seemed like my mother
was in the shadows of the dojo, crying.

191
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,471
At that age, I had no idea that I
was different from other kids..

192
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,058
When I got to junior high, I Wnally noticed it.

193
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,145
All of my friends werewt doing
marnilng and night practicas.

194
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,105


195
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:38,114
Everyone were pretty clothes,
dated bays, and had fun...

196
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,573


197
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,574
While I only... I only...

198
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,830
I don't hate judo.

199
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,250
But, I just want to be a normal girl...

200
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,670
Just a normal girl...

201
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,630
Yawara-savn .

202
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:59,511
Do a matrh and... LOSE in fmnt of everybody!

203
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,022
You were supposed to lose.

204
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,107
But you...

205
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,109
This is it.

206
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,026
Good bye judo.

207
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,111
Good bye judo.

208
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:16,820
Yawara!

209
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,155
How dare you try to lose?!

210
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:19,489
I won't ever have to throw anybody
with an iippan-zeoi anymore!

211
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:19,572
I won't ever have to throw anybody
with an i-ppan-zeori anymore!

212
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:19,781
I won't ever have to throw anybody

213
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:19,906
I won't ever have to throw anybody

I won't ever have to throw anybody

00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:59,738


228
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:07,662
You won against Todo Yuki and your
official debut was decided.

229
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:11,916
And, as a special featurev we will have
a special guest exhibition prior

252
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:49,704

253
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,121
Fight-
That's the time you were coaching

254
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:50,580

That's the time you were coaching
the weak Musashiyama Judo club.

255
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:50,955
Fight-
That's the time you were coaching
the weak Musashiyama Judo club.

256
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,498
oh!
That's the time you were coaching
the weak Musashiyama Judo club.

257
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,751
That's the time you were coaching
the weak Musashiyama Judo Club

258
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:03,301
Okay. Let's do three laps of rabeit
hops around the school nrext.

259
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,096
Wham? That's im possible!

260
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:06,846
Yawara-saun !

261
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
rs

262
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,768
Hurry up, the repormrs are
going to mob you soon.

263
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,064
Your en-try into the tournament was confirmed
at the official press canference.

264
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,194
I don't want to be min the tournament!

265
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,739
You're unbelievably strong.

266
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,574
Put that talent to good use!

267
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,912
No! If I do jluudo, I can't wear pretty clothea!

268
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,290
You can wear pretty clothes
after you do an ippon-zeoxi.

269
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,375
I couldn't cook, either.

270
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,045
After winning a national tournament,
all your food can be eaten.

271
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:43,550
I want to fall in how normally,
and become a bride someday.

272
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,883


273
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,096
Even if you won a gold medal at the Olympics...

274
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,181
you could still have a wonderful love
rife... and be a notmal bride, too.

275
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,560
What would be normal about
a strong bride like that?

276
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,602
Let me off!

277
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,937
Just let me off!

278
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,397
Kidwnapper!

279
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,733
Watch it, watch it... come on!

280
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,317
That's dangerous!

281
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:06,448


282
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,450
Wow!

283
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,161
Hey, is this someone's extra mansion?

284
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,495
Dont be surprised by that.

285
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,413
Come over here!

286
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,709
Oh yeah! There they are!

287
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,213
There! Look closely, Yaw-ara-san!

288
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,298


289
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:28,136
Running iIn the sand with steel sandals
and dragging a giant tire...

290
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,138
This is Hnn'ami Sayaka's rignrous training!

291
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,432
Fight, fight!

292
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,018
Fiifty more meters!

293
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,019


294
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,523
Who do you thirmk that fashionable
young lady is doing that for?

295
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,817
Yawara-san, i-t's to fight you!

296
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,528


297
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,696
Sayaska-san!

298
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:52,285


299
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,412
You don't feel anything after seeing this...?

300
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,163
You don't fee! anything after seeing th.is...?

301
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,414


302
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,291


303
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:58,917
ways:

304
00:15:58,917 --> 00:15:59,042
?

305
00:15:59,042 --> 00:15:59,292
if

306
00:15:59,292 --> 00:15:59,376


307
00:15:59,376 --> 00:15:59,542


308
00:15:59,542 --> 00:15:59,709


309
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:09,386


310
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,762
Kazamautsunriwsan. ..

311
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,647
Yawa ra-san . . .

312
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,955
Oh... oh really?

313
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,249
Is the-t so? oh, I see!

314
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,083
I thought so.
Is that so? Oh, I see!

315
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:40,750
I thought so.
Is that so? Oh, I see-!

316
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,794
Yawara-san feels some-thing for me...

317
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,379
I see!

318
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,383
You're happy about this, aren't you?

319
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,802
D-dnn't kin me!

320
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,846
She's stilil in high school!

321
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,099
Han'ami Sayaka is a high school girl, too.

322
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,142
HIuh?

323
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:02,355
Don't tell me you think there's something
going on between me and her?

324
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:07,360
Well, with your reputation, iit's
really hard to think otherwise.

325
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,156
You're only aggressive whh women, right?

326
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,910
If only you could have used that
agressiun xin judo matches.

327
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,705
What do you mean by that?

328
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm saying that, hand you used your girlwchasing
energies in judo matches...

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,297
You coulnd"ve won the Nationals
a-t leagt. You stage-fright freak!

330
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,465


331
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,675
I don't chase giris...

332
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,053
I'm just attractive, so they come to me.

333
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,930
Hrs the girls who want me,

334
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,432
just like Yawara-san.

335
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,895
Ahh, this is so stupid.

336
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,315
I wan-ted to ask you, but I changed my muinti

337
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,025
It was stupid of me to think
of asking you, anyway.

338
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,193
H...hney wralft!

339
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,694
What were yoru going to asak me to do?

340
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,030


341
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,782
Oh, I know!

342
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,826
Yawara-san wiilll Hsten to what I say...

343
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,622
You wanted me to ask her to fight
in the tournament, right?

344
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:03,875
l"lil do it!

345
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,334


346
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:10,882
That's when I started seeing Yawara-san
as a girl and not just as a judo athlete.

347
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,302
IS that. . .

348
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,637
Is that true?

349
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:16,680
Yes.

350
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,807
Your wait is over.

351
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,644
We have found Mr. Inokuma Kojiro in Seoul.

352
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:23,853
Very well.

353
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:24,312


354
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,357
Start the negotiatjans to have him as my coach.

355
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:27,732


356
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,026
I don"t care how much it casts.

357
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:30,985


358
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:35,365
But my daughter will get even stronger, too.

359
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,452


360
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,204
Daughter?!

361
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,916
When Inukuma Koj'i-ro becomes my coach,

362
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:51,297
l willl throw you beyond the
galaxy, lnukuma Yawara.

363
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,884
She embarrassed me, who is perfect
at everything and what's more,

364
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,430
that cat-thief is trying to steal Kaza'ma-tsuri-san!

365
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:04,227
She wan against me only once and
now she's avoiding fighting me!

366
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,275
Begin !

367
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:28,877


368
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:29,711


369
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,089
Inokuma Yawara won against me
and it was totally an accident.

370
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:40,180
It was pure luck! One chance in a million.

371
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,393
Finallly .

372
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,236
N.. no way...

373
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,446


374
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,531
That can't be!

375
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,909
You completely won.

376
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:01,826
But.

377
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,788
Take you? To Setagay-a's an Gym now?

378
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,707
Yes. Please take me.

379
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,001
We won't make it in time.

380
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,880
And your awards ceremony is about to start.

381
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,465
Take me!

382
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:23,223
You were only concerned about the Musashiyama
High Judo Club's matches.

383
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,182


384
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,851
I'm sorry, Inokuma.

385
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,520
I can't do it anymore.

386
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,022
Hanazono-kun!

387
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:35,735
arm, I can hear yaw voice in my head...

388
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,737


389
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,825
But, I'm a wimp that gives up easily.

390
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:46,121
I... I'm IOO years too early and unworthy
to fall in love with you.

391
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:48,998
Hanaznno-k unn!

392
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,671
Hanazn no-kuln!

393
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,923
Yawaara-savn !

394
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:03,930
Hanazono-kun, grab the back of his collltatr with
your heft hand! Then, hook youlr left leg into it!

395
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,731
Clamp your legs aruunnd his left arm.

396
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:17,527
cradle his other arm with your right arm, and
then tighten his collar with your left arm!

397
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,863


398
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,407
Put more pressure in ybwr legs!

399
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,867
Keep going, Hanazono-san.!

400
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,542
He got IR!

401
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,839
End of math.

402
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,062
lInoekuma. . .

403
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,357
I"m. .. here, Hanazono- kun.

404
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,861
Did you win?

405
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,488
Yes.

406
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,616
I... won.

407
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,787
Really? You're so great, lInnonkuma.

408
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,875
You're really great.

409
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,585
ND...

410
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,380
All of you are great.

411
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,467
We all won for the first time. Us!

412
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,429
It's because you taught us judo, YHWElra-SBIL

413
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,393
No, all of you taught me instead.

414
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,398
Doing your beat is. ..

415
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:39,943
great. isn't it?

416
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:48,326
Iwill never forget that time...

417
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,744
your smile.

418
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,580


419
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:52,664


420
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:52,747


421
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:52,831


422
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:52,914


423
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,542
Cd

424
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,919
In retrospect, my youth's been terrible.

425
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:58,003
In retrospect, my youth: been terrible.

426
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:58,086
In retrospect, my youth's been terrible.

427
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:58,169
In retrospect, my youth: been terrible.

428
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:58,253
In retrospect, my youth's been terrible.

429
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:58,336
In retrospect, my youth's been terrible.

430
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:58,503
In retrospect, my youthes been terrible.

431
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:58,712
In retrospect, my youthes been terrible.

432
00:22:58,712 --> 00:22:59,629
in retrospect, my youth: been terrible.

433
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,463
lIn retrospect, my youth's been terrible.

434
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:00,588
In retrospect, my youth's been terrible.

435
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,756
What are you saying?

436
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,009
It's full of greatness!

437
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,679
You'll be happy for the rest uf your
rife, if you do just as I say.

438
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,724
That's how things go from bad to worse.

439
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,308
Next Yawam!

440
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:17,355
Yawanra has come, seen, and conquered.
 he is the world's number one jundo gilrll

441
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:21,109
If you don't watch it, l"ll do an ude
h-ishigi juji gatame on you.

442
00:23:21,109 --> 00:25:28,862


443
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:45,814
Winning against Belkens and Teleshikova,
Inokuma Yawara-san became number i .

444
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,692
I will not continue judo anymore.

445
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,320
Because of my jludo, my family is scattered.

446
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:06,376
Yawara-san, you have decided
to quit judo several times,

447
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,087
but you have always come back.

448
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:14,342
Yawara lnokurna. I came all this
way from Canada to see you.

449
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,094
Come on, l-et's fight.

450
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,512


451
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:17,595


452
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:17,679


453
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:17,762
For example, Jody Rockwell,

454
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:18,471
For example, Jody Rockwell,

455
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,640
For example, Jody Rockwell,

456
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,812
You would have quit judo a long
time ago, if you hadn't met her.

457
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,899
Shes Finally met her match.

458
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:35,572
Yaw-ara's encountered a strong opponent for
the filrst time, so she's actually enjoying it.

459
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,160
I've got you now!

460
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,502
Are you okay, Jody?

461
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,422
Fm okay.

462
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,802
lfs not good to worry about the apponenlt
dulring a match, Yawara.

463
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,304
Here I come!

464
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,901
Let's atop, Jody.

465
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,403
Your arm is seriously ilnj ured.

466
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:17,739
No!

467
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:23,536
Until now, I've never had so much fun doing judo.

468
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,248
Please, fight me, Yawaral

469
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,001
Yawara, please!

470
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:32,921
Jody. . .

471
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,970
This is the first time I've ever had fun, too.

472
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,263
So, next time...

473
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,099
Next time?

474
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:52,148
When your arm is headed, let's fight again, mkay?

475
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,650
At a competition somewhere.

476
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,487
R-Really? Yawara?

477
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,281
Yes. I promise.

478
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:06,204
You went to many competitions
in order to keep that promise.

479
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,455
Ippon.

480
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:08,331


481
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,916
uncredeb Ie.

482
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,293
She advances to the finals, just like that!

483
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,922
Coach Yuutenj'i. I didn't know she was this great!

484
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,384
President, then we have no problems
with her scholarship appointment?

485
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,302
Not even a problem!

486
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,639
Well! surely win a Barcelona Olympic
gold medal for our school!

487
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,724


488
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,393
My textbooks!

489
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:31,146
You went through my room again, didn't you?

490
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:32,147
Gear!

491
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,900
Give them back!

492
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,861
No.

493
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,531
Iit's useless to waste your time studying
all night long without sleeping.

494
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,532
Useless?

495
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,285
What's meless about my exam studies?

496
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:48,788
You're already set to enroll into Saikai College.

497
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,540
I'm going to Mitsuba Wamen's College!

498
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,499


499
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:56,629
Listen, I will never let you
go to that Mil-hm college!

500
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,048
l"l.l keep these textbooks.

501
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,925
Give them back to me!

502
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,390
Geez, I have to use up my month's
allowance for these.

503
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,642
And, I'm the one trying to budget
the family expenses, too.

504
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,606
Here he comes again,

505
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,400


506
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,402
that pervert Kazama tsuri.

507
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:28,620
"But, it is often difficult to distinguish a person:
true feeling," Tam Buchanan said to me.

508
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,247
That's perfect.

509
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,665
You're excellent, Yawaramaa-n.

510
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,794
No, you teach very well, Kazamatsuri-sazn.

511
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,088
No, you're very smart.

512
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,298
You won't have any prublems
getting into Mitsuba College.

513
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:41,966
I don't know.

514
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:45,720
But, Kazamartsuri-san, why are
you so good with English?

515
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,682
Once, I was very fascinated by the
works of a certain American poet.

516
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,060
I wanted to read the poems in the original
language, so I really studied English.

517
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,019
Poems?

518
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:57,273
"We loved with a love that was more than love.

519
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:02,195
She was a child and I was a child.

520
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:06,449
In this kingdom by the sea,

521
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,370
But we loved with a low that
was more than haven"

522
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,542
Just a few lines from Edgar
Allen Poe's "Annabel Lee-l"

523
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:21,965
Like this poem, l"nm probably booking...
for that single, eternal woman to love.

524
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,801
Or something like that.

525
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,720
Was that a Little plretentinus?

526
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,555
Nat real'ly. . .

527
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:32,851
Geez!

528
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,561
What are they doing?

529
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,312
It's been over   hours now! B hours!

530
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,189
M....Ma-tauda-san, I cant breathe!

531
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:38,732


532
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,943
Damn, that Kazama-tsuri!

533
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,278
Don't tell me...

534
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,572
Studs are so lucky.

535
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,823
You idiot!

536
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,283
Don't think so nasty!

537
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,868
You were thinking the same

Last time was so good!

544
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:02,464
I've been thinking about you ever since then.

545
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:02,714


546
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,966
I...I'm grateful for an your help!

547
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,217
Can I'?

548
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,177
Oh sure.

549
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,720
Can I come over now?

550
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,221
Oh really?

551
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:10,972


552
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,432
ND!

553
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,016
T

554
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,685
I... I'm bedridden with a really
bad headache right now.

555
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:16,686
Maybe next time?

556
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,104
Umm, HI...

557
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,105
Yes?

558
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,440
Make some tea.

559
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,402
Tea, huh?

560
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,363
Oh no!

561
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:32,035
The cup with the lipstick stain of White Lily
College girl, Megulmi, is still in the kitchen.

562
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,870
Helho? Shin-Chan?

563
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,204


564
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,163
Oh, there's a culp.

565
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,790
Hey, that's okay.

566
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,208
You must be tired from doing
jludo and exam studying.

567
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,584
You must be tired from doing
jludo and exam studying.

568
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,251
You must be tired from doing
judo and exam studying

569
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:44,714
I"m actually very energized. I'm not tired at all.

570
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,967
No, no. Just sit there.

571
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,720
You're very mice, Kazanmavtsulri-san.

572
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:03,149
Come ocn, let's get back to studying
again, Yawara-sam!

573
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,153
Kazanm'a-tsuxrir-san !

574
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:07,862


575
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,323
Let's take your friend out to eat with us....

576
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,496
That was divine retribution.

577
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,456


578
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:22,752
We have much bigger and happier n-ews!

579
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:28,383
Our only daughter, Sayaka,
and Kazamatxu ri--kun. . .

580
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,804
are now engaged!

581
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:33,638
What?

582
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,935
W...wa;it.

583
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,438
This is a very happy outcome!

584
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:45,442
Shinnoswke, now our Kazamatsuxri
Brewery is in wife hands.

585
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,110
Serves you right!

586
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,154
So, that means...

587
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,406
Wait, everyone --

588
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,116
This is Sayaaka.

589
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:57,746
To be engaged to Kazanmatsuri-san
is the happiast even-t for me.

590
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:04,669
But, i:n order to have a bILissful
marriage, I mmt do one thing.

591
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:11,134
That is, to defeat Inokuma Yawara,
and become Number One in Japan!

592
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,552
Bun.

593
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:22,729
I... I was the only one thinking we had something.

594
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,815
Kazanmavtsulril-san,

595
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,817
Fm... such a fool!

596
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:35,158
And then, the day of the exam came.

597
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,078
Yau sprained your hand in yesterday's match?

598
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,164
I can't hold a pencil because it hurts so much.

599
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,169
I think I barely made it through
the morning exam,

600
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,880
but the pain numbs my brain...

601
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,090
I dun? think I can make it anymore.

602
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,471
I need to go.

603
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,264
You're going to take ft with that hand?

604
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,814
Yawara-saun .

605
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,193
I studied so hard for this.

606
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,570
Regardless of the result. ! won't give up.

607
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,406

608

At worsta rll go to Savikai College.

610
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,330
Matsuda-san, the-t choice will be great
news mantena-l for you, right?

611
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,299
Give me your right hand.

00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,094
Just give me your right hand.

613
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:53,403
There was a tennis player who won at Wixmbelsdaon
by tyilng the racket tn her injured hand"

614
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,780
Here you go.

615
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,742
It looks dumb, but it"s better than
not being able to hold a pencil.

616
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:03,038
Give your all in me Last fro-minute bout.

617

Good for you.

620
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,253
Yawara, are you not home yet:!?

621
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,714
That girl, breaking curfew again!

622
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,970
Yawara just called earlier.

623
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,723
She's working an a report with her friend.

624
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,519
Are you sure she didn't go to a disco?

625
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,020
NmNn.

626
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,148
I doubt that.

627
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:20,490


628
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:20,573

631
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:20,824

00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:20,907

00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:21,950


636
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,075


637
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:27,914

00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:27,997

00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:28,081


640
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:28,164

00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:28,415


644
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,836
Jigoro-san's guess was an the money.

645
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,087
The World Cup was coming up,

646
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:34,295
The World Cup was coming up;

647
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:34,379
The World Cup was coming up:

648
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:34,462
The World Cup was coming up:

649
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:34,546
The World Cup was coming Lipi

650
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,632

00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:41,261
but since Yawara-san became
a college student".

652
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,023
What is that girl doing'n

653
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:02,782
The one who brought you back to judo is...

654
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:03,658
What?!

655
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,117


656
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,703
Hue touched yowr bottom!

657
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,246


658
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:11,916
So I jlust tried to brush him off...

659
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,543
Brush him off?

660
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:16,796
Jtust brushing cuff caused a person
to fly through the aiur?

661
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:18,256
It was an accident.

662
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:22,093
He accidently tripped right then.

663
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,307
IsnT that judo?

664
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:32,020
Oh, what are you talking about?

665
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,189
What is this jlundn thing?

666
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:39,569
IInokunma-san, I reaullly think
I have seen you before.

667
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:40,779


668
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:44,074
Back then, just after being forced
to give up on being a ballerina,

669
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,077
I was living at my home in Shizuoka without
being able to find any new goals,

670
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,080
and I was just spacing out in front of the TV.

671
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,208
Another llppon-zeai I

672
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,420
She was glowing incredibly.

673
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,799
I didn't know a thing about judo, but I would tell,

674
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:05,512
that she is a gift who wi-ll become the best in the
world - the very thing I was trying to achieve.

675
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,722
Thank you, lncnkuma-san!

676
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:12,143
I decided to give my days of youth
a try again because of you.

677
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:12,560


678
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,357
I realized that I shouldn't just sit there
when I saw you shining so brightly.

679
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:20,402
I decided to give my best at the entrance exam.

680
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,570
This is so excitilng!

681
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,114
You are that giri!

682
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,950
I have a Friend who will became the wodd's best!

683
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:47,971
I really wanted to dance for the world.

684
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,934
But you can!

685
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:59,691
Von can make my unfulfilled dream a reality!

686
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:05,530
Yawara-san decided to compete
in the World Cup.

687
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,577
M...Ma...Ma...

688
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,287
..Ya...

689
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,090

YES.

691
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,016
That newspaper reporter.

692
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:37,604
Yawara, it might get difficult for you, but your
steady boyfriend will help you through it all.

693
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,023
What? You have no one, and yet
you don't want to meet anyone.

694
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,775
You're zs already.

695
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,651
Start thinking about it.

696
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,570
I have someone in mind;

697
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,491

698
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:55,705


699
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,832
I have someone in mind;

700
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,836
She's going to be in the World cup.

701
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:09,761

709

After the Wodd Cup...

713
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:58,226

721
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,454
U'h, well...

722
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:21,124
I wanted to reserve a special interview...

723
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,335


724
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:26,463
Ma-tsuda-san, you're always about wark.

725
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,089


726
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:29,674
Please excuse me.

727
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:35,305
Todo-san.

728
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,432


729
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:41,102
After the World Cup...

730
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:55,658
Fujiikmsan !

731
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:12,676
Fujiikn-sem. . .

732
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,303
Peace!

733
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:22,644
You left for Seoul and stepped
out onto the World's Stage.

734
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:27,982
By the way, Jigoro-san. Is what you
said in the commentator box true?

735
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:30,777
The reason Yawara-san's father.
ch'iiro-san is missing,

736
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:35,198
is due to the shock of being thrown
by S-yealr-ohd Yawaravsan.

737
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,200
Dan't tallk about that!

738
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,036
But if that's true, it's so drama-tic.

739
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,416
So I really was the reason.

740
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,084
The reason he's gone...

741
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:57,721
It was w years ago.

742
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:03,601
By losing to Yamashfta-kum, I realized
the toughness of judo once again.

743
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:07,731
And I leamed what I was missing.

744
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:11,234
It's the natural born talent

745
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:21,786
And I didn't realizza someone with a natural
born talent was so close to me.

746
00:44:24,664 --> 00:44:28,710
But that day, she wrely performed a throw.

747
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:32,130
I knew I was thrown.

748
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,342
By my mere five year old daughter!

749
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,724
We heard that story.

750
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:46,644
From Yarwam-saan. She told
me with such a sad face.

751
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:50,899
The shock was not from beilng
thrown by Yawara...

752
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:57,947
By seeing her true talent, I...

753
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,492
I was... truly touched.

754
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:06,206
And so you left for a journey of training,"

755
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:15,340
Kojiro-san, where are you?

756
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:34,317
I took apart your father's judo
gi, and sewed it up again.

757
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:36,319
I'm glad I cauald finish it before you left.

758
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,071
Dads?

759
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:45,787
lit was Dads dream to become the
best judo wrestler in the wand.

760
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:54,170
I wonder if I can see him in Seoul?

761
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,006
rm sure you can.

762
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,717


763
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:10,103


764
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:10,186


765
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:10,270


766
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:10,353


767
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:10,478


768
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:10,603
x: SK

769
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:10,687


770
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:10,770


771
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:10,854
Ky .

772
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:10,937


773
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:11,021


774
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:11,104


775
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:11,229


776
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:11,396


777
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,152
Young Lady,

778
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:28,371
You ruled all other sports, but
you could not rule Judo.

779
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:32,959
Holding back is not good for you.
Cry to your heart's content.

780
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,878
As inf I wauww cry!

781
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:39,049
The only time I will cry is when
I beat hnokuma Yawara,

782
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:41,634
and after becoming the true queen of the world,

783
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,095
I will cry for joy!

784
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:47,390
How could I dare cry until then? How could I....

785
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:54,689
Looks like I was right at judging you
as the damned rival of Yawara,

786
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:57,609
Lady, you will get much stronger!

787
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:05,700
Read that and study a lot!

788
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,204
And get much, much, very much stronger,

789
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:11,456
and come back to face Yawawra!

790
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,458
As the strangest rival in exmance.

791
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:17,087
Wait and see, lnokuma Yawara!

792
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:19,673
Miss ,

793
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:23,134

Please come in.

795
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:43,113
I've been waiting far you, lnokuma Knjmro-sazn.

796
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:58,169
Grandpa, Dad heft because of my jundzo.

797
00:47:58,169 --> 00:48:00,839
Stop talking nonsense!

798
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,925
Do you think yau can get a gold medal
at the Olympics with that attitude?

799
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:05,427
It has nothing to do with me.

800
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:09,472
We are starting youxr training right now and
we're going to fix your loser attitude.

801
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:11,933
I don't want to...

802
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:15,353

803
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:17,480
