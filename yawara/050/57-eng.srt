1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:36,096


2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,722
Kojiro-san

3
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,224
Mavtsuda-san.

4
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,853
Such a sharp third-rate jaulrna-List!

5
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:48,400
You sensed a scoop and came
here, just like a cat bwrgzlar.

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,113
I asked Mr. Inukuma Rodin
to be my exclusive coach

7
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:57,075
so that I can defeat Inokuma Yawara in Barcelona.

8
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,993
What did you say?!

9
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,122
Koj'ilro-san, do you have any idaa
what Yawara is going to do?

10
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,500
Yawara-san is goving to quit judo!

11
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,671
That's what she always does.

12
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,423
Win and run off be-fare she loses.

13
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,093
She must want to get stronger
while pretending to quit.

14
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,761
it wi'll never wark that way.

15
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,096
No, that's not true!

16
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,764
Yawara-san is Eerinus.

17
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:24,185
She thinks that her judo is the reason

18
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,855
that you left your familly.

19
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,274
She thinks it's her fault!

20
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,650
That's wrong.

21
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,820
Then why donT you tell her that in person?

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,488
Came with me, right now!

23
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:40,201
You are the only one who can convince her.

24
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,955
If you meet her and tell her
the truth, then she wrilil...

25
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,374
I've told you, I can't meet her right new.

26
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,084
How come?

27
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:52,380
Are you saying you don"t mind
if she quits judo, Koj'iro-san?!

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,006


29
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,426
Stnp saying Yawara. Yawara, Yawara!

30
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,762
rm so irriitated.

31
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,890
Have this th-irdvrate reporter leave at once!

32
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,894
Wait! Kojiro-san!

33
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,437
Hey, let me go!

34
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,522
Meet wfth Ya-wara-san!

35
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,108
Knjiro-san! Why not?

36
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,109
Kajn'ro-san !

37
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:20,867
Yawara!

38
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:25,121
Don't be so arrogant just because
you won the match!

39
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,209
I will teach you the seriousness of judo!

40
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,085
Open the door!

41
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:30,627
It doesn't have to be today, does it?
Open the door!

42
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,004
It doesn't have to be today, does it?

43
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,800
She must be tired.

44
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,679
No way?! You're joking.

45
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,641
You must be joking, right? Right? Right? Right?

46
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:54,693
Because of my judo, my fami'ly is scattered.

47
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,613
That... that," that's a lie!

48
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,573
That's a lie-l

49
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm sorry, F ujikmsan.

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,843
Well, thanks again for cheering me on..

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,345
Next is Barcelona!

52
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,014
Do your best!

53
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,557
Go far fut!

54
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,642
You are cute!

55
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,563
Eut, I...

56
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,034
Thank you very much.

57
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,297
Thanks a lot.

58
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,923
By the way...

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,552
I've noticed...

60
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,971
Is that the gold medal?

61
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:12,979
I toutally forgot to take it off whnen
I got medicine from the she-Ives!

62
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,856
Huh? Gold medal?!

63
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,984
You must be lnokuma Yawara's...

64
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,944
I was cheering for her.

65
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,197
She did great at the Warld Cup.

66
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,742
It's no big deal.

67
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,870
Her goal is to win at the Barcelona Olympics and

68
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,414
receive the National Achievement Award.

69
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,291
Yawara-san can do iut'!

70
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,501
That's right!

71
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,170
She has such a wonderfunl grandfather!

72
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,715
Even if ynu praise me, I won't
give you a discount!

73
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,653
Umm, Fujiko-san...

74
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,404
Eh?

75
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,240
Oh, nothing...

76
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,412
Inokumal-san. . .

77
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,079
Eh?

78
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,500
Nothing. . .

79
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,377
Then, see you tomorrow.

80
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,170
Yeah, see you.

81
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,136
Fujiiko-san . . .

82
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,017
What am I supposed to do?

83
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:37,230
How come Kojiro-san won't go see Yawara-san?

84
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,481
Matsuda !

85
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:38,982


86
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,774
Yes!

87
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,402
How can you space out when we're so busy?!

88
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
Fimh yuur artiche!

89
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,780
Change the front page!

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,031
Yes!

91
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:53,455
That man.... He isn't satisfied
with GOO mlillllmn yen?

92
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,540
Hue eats all day...

93
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,586
What the hell are three generations
of the Inokuwma family thinking?!

94
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,465
Sayaukaaan! Being irritated isn't good for you.

95
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,967
That's right.

96
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,136
We've gm plenty of time.

97
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:13,808
Plus I can be alone with you.

98
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,268
And I will always...

99
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,817
Not good",

100
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,112
I won't be stuck with her under these conditions.

101
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:31,910
She sure is attractive, but
Yawara-san is the best!

102
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,536


103
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,372
Kazamautiu ri san!

104
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,582
Kazamautgulriwsam

105
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,751
Ah! Well I...

106
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:46,299


107
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,550
Is this Kazavmatsuri?

108
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,679
I wanted to talk to you about Kojiro-san...

109
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,472
Can we meet tomorrow?

110
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,056
What?!

111
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,225
He's not doing welil?'!

112
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,142
That's bad.

113
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,812
I'm heading there right now.

114
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,607
I have to go see my uncle who's not dying well.

115
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,776
Then I wiIlll come with you!

116
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,319
Oh, no...

117
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,697
he's not that sick. you know...

118
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,447


119
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,825
I'll be back by tomorrow.

120
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:21,251
Yahoo! I'm free now! Banzaaasi!

121
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,254
...The melody fmm yvoulr lips,

122
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:28,383
all too soon turns to evening.

123
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:34,514
If I look down upon the town,
I can see your figure...

124
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,945
Good evening.

125
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,947
Kazamaltsulrinsan.

126
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,449
Long time no see.

127
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:57,746
I didn't even say "congratulations"
since I've been so busy.

128
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,371


129
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,083
It's been awh.iile since we've had a meal together.

130
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:02,792


131
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:07,339
Korean barbecue iss realllly good, but
I like Japanese food the hem

132
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,591
But if I'm aff guard, l"ll get fat.

133
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,011
Innok'unma-sanu. you look happy.

134
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,014
Really?

135
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,475
I see.

136
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,770
It's true that Yawara is going to quit jundo...

137
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,315
She hates judo.

138
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,193
She might even detest ht.

139
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:33,740
What wm happen when she finds out that
her dad has been asked to coach Sayaka?

140
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,827
She should never know about that!

141
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:45,293
Why don't I let Yawara-san see her father?

142
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,463
Then she might...

143
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,469
No, no, if Sayaka-san finds out...

144
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,932
What are you thinking, Kaz'amatsuwri?

145
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,019
OK. I promise I won't tell her.

146
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,940
It's supposed to be a secret anyway.

147
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,650
Thanks.l

148
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,654
This is a mu! You thanked me!

149
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,031
Many things have happened bemtween us.

150
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,533
That's right!

151
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,133
l'nnokuma-savn, why don"t you
stop by my apartment?

152
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,386
Oh, I have something to do Isa-tear.

153
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,429
O'K .

154
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,513
Sorry.

155
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:38,930


156
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,516
Oops! It's already time to go!

157
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:46,980
You must have been busy doing
somethilng to hide from Say-aka.

158
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,444
Nothing can bind me except true have. Bye.

159
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,369
Yawazrmsaan !

160
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,997
Wow, this is great timing!

161
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,375


162
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,670
So you were supposed to have
a date with Kazamatsuri-san.

163
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,171


164
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,047
Ah, well. ..

165
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,258
Kazamatsu ri, you punk!

166
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,301
Matsuadawsan!

167
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:20,638
I met Mavtsuda-savn by accident
and we had a cup of coffee.

168
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,686
You were going to meet Yawara-san!

169
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,606
What is "true love"? What about
true love? You punk!

170
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,609
I can meet her anytime I want!

171
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,987
Don't worry, I will keep the promise!

172
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,072
Are you sure?

173
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,282
What promise?

174
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,075


175
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,534
It's nothing!

176
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,536
Yeah, it's nothing!

177
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,120


178
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,998
Let's go eat, Yawaral-san.

179
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,625
Hold on! I'm coming too'

180
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,210
Matsuda-san!

181
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,962
I do NOT trust you!

182
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,630


183
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,343
You just want to be around her, don't you?

184
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,553
Shut your mouth! I... ljust...!

185
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,555
I think I"ll go too.

186
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:10,480


187
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,984
The final match that you won against
Telesh'i'kcva was amazing!

188
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,446
You are the world's strongest judo princess.

189
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,990
Let's not talk about quudno...

190
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,368
Oh, I'm sorry,

191
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:30,792
I almost stepped over the line
and ruined dinner for you.

192
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,629
How is the homemade fcuie gras croquette?

193
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,548


194
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,800
It's very... right? Fujiko-saxn!

195
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,011
What's with cro-que-tte?!

196
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,804
Just say it normally!

197
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,769
A peaceful flavor,

198
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,479
m is velvet on the lips,

199
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:57,318
the beautiful sparkling rullyy red,

200
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,657
Romancfee-Contj, Yawara-san,
is completely mks you.

201
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,534


202
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,411
I"ll have some.

203
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:16,046


204
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,173
You! It's ananQe-Cantj . . .

205
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,215


206
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,550
Ilnokumawsan!

207
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,176
Yes?

208
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,927
You weren't serious, right?

209
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,639
It's a lie that ynu're going to quit judo!

210
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,351
How dare you, Yawaura!

211
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:33,313
It's time for practice, but she's
nowhere to be found!

212
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,190
Jmt as I thought!

213
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,736
She's so full of herself after
winning the WarLd Cup!

214
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,446
How immature she is, Yawara!

215
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,075
Oh! Jigormsaun, that's a gold medal!

216
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,455
I forgot to take it off when I changed my clothes!

217
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,707
Let's see... It's beautiful.

218
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,458
That's awesome!

219
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,671
I"m not happy yet.

220
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,549
Yawalra will earn another gold
medal at the Olympics!

221
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,150
I never knew that a person could fly like that.

222
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,236
it was scary but also amazing.

223
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,323
It's you! Only you cnuhd do such an amazing thing!

224
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,324
That's right!

225
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:31,079
Please let us be moved one more time!

226
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,330
Fujilko-saun . . .

227
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:32,747


228
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,125
Don't say that you will quit judo!

229
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,460
Tell me it's a lie-!

230
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,795


231
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,465
Fujiko-san, I know that you were very
touched by Yawarawsan's juudn,

232
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:49,139
but if you leave the weight of your dream
an her shoulders. ilt wil'l burden her.

233
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:49,764


234
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,141
No!

235
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:56,479
As Yawara-san's friend, you should
think about her happiness.

236
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:01,860
Would you respect her will?

237
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:03,987
Come!

238
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,864
What? Violent, aren't we?

239
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:12,704


240
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,707
Kazamatsuri! What are you thinking?!

241
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,500
What do you mean?

242
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,252
Tha-t's what I really think!

243
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,714
Yawara-saln is the most special person to me.

244
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,760
More than Honami Sayaka?

245
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,804
Then why don"t you hurry up and break
off your engagement to Sayaka?

246
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,891
You must be drunk!

247
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:38,229


248
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:42,442
Tell me, tell me you will continue
judo, lnokuma-san!

249
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,444
You are going to quit jludo. aren't you?

250
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,949
You think because of judo, your
family has become distant...

251
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,367


252
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,370
But, is that it, Yawanra-san?

253
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,746


254
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,499
It'a my jludo.

255
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,919
I threw my dad when I was five...

256
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,504
That is NOT true!

257
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:06,424
It's not your fault! Your dad didn't care abouut it!

258
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,677
How do you know?

259
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,804
Well... that's...

260
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,848
I know how you feel. Matsuda-san.

261
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,266
My feelings?

262
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:19,854
You won't get the scoop if Yawara-san quits judo.

263
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,693
It's natural that you dan't want her to qufut.

264
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:27,946
What?!

265
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,908
You should think about how Yawazra-san feels.

266
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:36,538
rt's too bad that she's quitting,

267
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,165
but Yawavra-san is Yawara-san.

268
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,671
Even if you quit judo, you"hl
still be a wonderfull g-irl.

269
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,845
Be quiet and listen!

270
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,265
What do you know about the way
she feels? What do YOU know?!

271
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,560
Martsuda-san, you are being rude.

272
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,187
Damn! Let me go!

273
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,731
Please stop.

274
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,364
Because of judo, only bad things have happened!

275
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,160


276
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,702
Yawara-san !

277
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,745
lnokulma-sam
Yawara-saun !

278
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:39,142

00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,393
Yawaral-san . . . !

280
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,455
Yawara!

281
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:05,627
How can you taks a bath when
you've skipped your training?!

282
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,296
I won't forgive you!

283
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:13,259
You'll get p'runy! You'll swell up!

284
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,637
Judo...

285
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,023
I've got to do something.

286
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,026
I have tn... I have...

287
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,780
Iwnokwmamsan. . .

288
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,793
One mare tilme!

289
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,294
Han aznno !

290
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,798
Someone is backing far you.

291
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,759
v

292
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,053
And it's a girl, you punk"

293
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,346
What?! A girl?!

294
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,431
You...!

295
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:03,184
Why do you have a female friend
with that look on her face?!

296
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,564
Inokuma said that?!

297
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,440
Yes.

298
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,361
She is going to quit judo?

299
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,114
I thought you might know what to say to her

300
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:21,327
seeing how you've known her since high school.

301
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,456
I, llrwkulma, you...!

302
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,876
Sempai !!

303
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,797
She was hlkz that before as well.

304
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,343
We were the ones who dragged
her into the jIUdD scene

305
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,804
when lnonkurnna was avoiding jrundo
in our high school days.

306
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:45,602
She helped out the poor, weak
Musashiymna High Judo Club.

307
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:45,769
F ight-
She helped out the poor, weak
Musashiyama High Judo Club.

308
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:45,935
Fight-

309

the Mvusashwfyama JIundo Team,

322
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,966
which initially head not a trace
of pride within them,

323
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,093
started to gain confidence liittie by little.

324
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,391
Hanazono- kuln!

325
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,393

Yawara-saun !

Hanazono-kun, gab the bank of his coIlIa-r with
your left hand! Then, hook your left leg into it!

328
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,657
Clamp your legs around his left arm,

329
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:45,412
cradle his other arm with your right arm, and
then tighten his collar with your left arm!

330
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,634
End of match.

We all won fur the first time. Us!

IIt's because you taught us judo, Yawaura-san..

335
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,111
No, all of you taught me instead.

336
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,867
Doing your beat is. ..

337
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,620

Yawara-San ! !

00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:37,630
She never deserted us.

341
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:44,679
Even though she had a match that day at the
Martial Arts Halt, she cared about us so much.

342
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:49,684
She cried far us as if she was crying for herself.

343
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:55,315
She taught us the strictness and struggle of judo.

344
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:59,861
And on top of it, the joy of doing judo!

345
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,494
Judo Club. . . l!

346
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,581
We need the Judo Club to bring her back to judo!

347

356
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,035


357
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:49,119


358
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:49,202


359
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:49,285
