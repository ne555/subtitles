1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:42,310


2
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,482
Then your journey to master
"Jiu" beating "Go" is...

3
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,359
Yawara-mn is part of the reason too?

4
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,153
Jody! Right there!

5
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,491
YEW

6
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,869
What really happened?

7
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,580
Between you and Yawara-san,..

8
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:13,633


9
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,428
The World Cup of Judo in Seoul.

10
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,180
It's the second match of the free
weight class semi-finals.

11
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,934
Rockwell of Canada has won a yu:ko from
Teleshikova of the Soviet Union,

12
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,811
and ghe's really getting in to it!

13
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,042
lnukuma Yawara of Japan has already
won a spot in the finals

14
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,086
by defeating Balkans of Belgium
i-n the film: match.

15
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,797
Who will be facing her?

16
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,173


17
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,133
Rockwell?

18
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,593
Or Teleshi kova?

19
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:05,685


20
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,561
Out of bounds!

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,063
So c hose-l

22
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,774
Rockwell! haraui goshi wasn't good.

23
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,109
It went out M bounds"

24
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,738
They faced each other iIn Canada last year,

25
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,742
wherre Rockwell injured a ligament in her
knee, giving vicmry tn Teleshuikava.

26
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,203
So, Yamashita-sam,

27
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,581
can we assume that Rockwelll"s knee
has rectwered complnedtenly?

28
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,584
Yes. it's a very impressive recovery.

29
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:34,089
Anyway, what concerns me
are TeleshIWkova's maves.

30
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,549
Right, Master anro?

31
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,555
He's stivlll axrou n d?

32
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,309
That avrmy cut girl": not fighting
with her full force.

33
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,560
Right.

34
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,563
Teleshilmvait wiInIMIng moves are throws,

35
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,025
but she has not yet today performed
a single throw.

36
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,777
She won with a floor hold in the last match,

37
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,571
and she has only used sweeps in this match.

38
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,367
I see..

39
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:09,708


40
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:09,791


41
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,168


42
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,044
Yes!

43
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:13,545


44
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:14,754
Koka!

45
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,213


46
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,506


47
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,633
You got it!

48
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,140
It was ten years ago.

49
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,645
By lnsilng to Yamashrivta-kun,

50
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,189
I realized the toughness of jlundo once again.

51
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:40,780
Around that time, I was conceited enough to
think that i had mastered "Ju" beating ".'Go

52
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:46,286
But after losing to Yaymashita-kuxn, I
was ashamed of my cmnceitedness.

53
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,749
And I have since learned what I was mining

54
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,754
It's the natural born talent,





55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:06,056
And I didn't realizi- someone with a natural
born talent was so close to me.

56
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,440
It may sound unbelievable.

57
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:23,740
It may have appeared that I just tripped
while playing with my daughter.

58
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,741
But...

59
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,701
But that day,

60
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,746
she surely performed a throw.

61
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,249
I knew I was thrown.

62
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,544
By my mere five year old daughter!

63
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,762
I've heard that awry.

64
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,597
Froum Yawara-san.

65
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,767
She told me with such a sad face.

66
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:56,272
But if shs learns that she was the cause
of her father's disappearance,

67
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,233
she"lll be saddened even mare.

68
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,654
No, the shock was not from
being thrown by Yawara.

69
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:08,785
By seeing her true talent, I...

70
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,163
I was... truly touched.

71
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,543
The musician. Mozart

72
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:21,506
composed a concert that impreged
the public when he was five.

73
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:28,013
And he earned the title of prodigy when
he had a concert tour at the age of six.

74
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:34,144
In order for em ordinary person to
catch up with such a prodigy,

75
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:39,232
we need hundreds... no, thousands
or millions of times as much effort.

76
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:44,237
And so you left for a journey of training...

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,747
But how long will it take for you to master it?

78
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,040
I don't know.

79
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,253
But there is someone who is approaching
that perfection through her efforts.

80
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,466
Hey, the better. ..

81
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,343
I wonder if Yawa-ra has read that letter?

82
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,761
Letter?

83
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,810
What did you try to tell Yawara-san
with that letter?

84
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,815
Even Yaw-ara will lose against her in the
finals, if she lets her guard down.

85
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,194
Is mat Teleshikova? Or Rockwell?

86
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,838
Out of bounds!

87
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,758
Lets go, Jody!

88
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,717
Way to go!

89
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,345
You'll win at this rate!

90
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,103
FinaHy!

91
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,689
Finally, Ican fight Yawara!

92
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,774
Wait for me, Yawara!

93
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,735


94
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,736
Uchi mata!

95
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,327
Rockwell pinched Telnshikava's
leg to prevent the unchi mata!

96
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,370


97
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,165
Tehesh'ikuva quickly moves m onunchui gari!

98
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:27,007


99
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:27,841
Koka!

100
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,135
Oh my God!

101
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,761
DonT worry.

102
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,971
It's only a kaka.

103
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,392
That was so close for Rockwell.

104
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,354
It's an incredible rush of attacks.

105
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,108
And Teleshikova is still not using any throws.

106
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,651
Oh?

107
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,211
Jody?

108
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:31,488
Rockwell appears to bus in shock from
Teleshikova's fierce attacks,

109
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:31,696
but she's up again.

110
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,238
but she's up again.

111
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:32,739
but she's up again.

112
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:32,822
but she's up again.

113
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,239
but she's up again.

114
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:33,490
but she's up again.

115
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:33,990


116
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,074


117
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,158


118
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,452
And now the match resumes.w

119
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,287
One minute remaining in this match.

120
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,623
Rockwell leads the match with one ywko.

121
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,582
Begin !

122
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,210

123
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,960
Teleshikova makes a move already-l

124
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,670
Teleshikova makes a move already!

125
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,962
Wow!

126
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,676
Yukn!

127
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,134


128
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,928
Yuko!

129
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,138
Telaeshuikova wfns a yuko with a knuchvi gari!

130
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,140
Now they're tied in points!

131
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,851
It's anyone's game!

132
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,185


133
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,729
No! Jody!

134
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,689
Jody !

135
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:11,653

00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,093


195
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,055
Rockwell of Canada has one
each of yulko and koka.

196
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,018
Te'leshikova of the Soviuet now
has two yuko and one koka.

197
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,563
Rockwell is in a pinch!

198
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:56,276
Telesh'ilkova will be going to the fins-ls
with her lead iln points at this rate-!

199
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,779
She Knows about it.

200
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,572
What?

201
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,576
Judy is trying hard not to Show iit,

202
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:09,039
but Te-leshikova already knows
that Jody has hurt her leg.

203
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,082
We mmzt stop her!

204
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,250
Or else, Jody willl...

205
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,376
Jody will...

206
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,045
What did you say?

207
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:20,050


208
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,815
Let's go, Jody'!

209
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,734
Jody...

210
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,236
Who is it going to be!?

211
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,701
Is Rockwell the one who Yawalra-san will
lose age-inst if she lets her guard down?

212
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,744
Or is it Teieghillwva?

213
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,913
Hey !

214
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,374
What if we forget about the letter,

215
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,585
and you give Yawara-san your advice directly?

216
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,589
I can't see her now.

217
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,591
Whyl?

218
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:07,764
Your daughtm is fighting so hard against
the power players af the world!

219
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:15,063
I won't let you make a selfish claim that you can't
see her for the sake of your own training!

220
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,858
Why did Yawara come to Seoul?

221
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,904
She came, thinking that she couhd meet me.

222
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,906
Isn't that it?

223
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:32,956
The reason she's doing judo is because she
thinks jludn is her last connection to me.

224
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,582
Isn't that it?

225
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,964
She hates jnudo.

226
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,384
She wouldnT participate in
the World Cup narmaJIy.

227
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,554
Yau speak as if youve been watching her cl-osely.

228
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,305
Close. ..

229
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,684
Yes. I've gotten close to her a number of timesy

230
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:57,564
But Yawara has shown no iunrtenrest towards judo.

231
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,482
Rather, She was avoiding it.

232
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,569
Maltsuda kun! It's all your daring!

233
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,572
Thank you for leading Yawara all this time-l

234
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,573
I appreciate it!

235
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:12,495
No, rm only chasing after Yawara-san...

236
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,290
Are you the one fighting?

237
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,586
Bye, Matsuda-Kunl

238
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,296


239
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,715
W-wadat a mlilnute!

240
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,300
Give your advice to Yawara-san!

241
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,843
Show her the better!

242
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,762
Vawara will understand that message!

243
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,262


244
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,932
And watch after Yawara from
now on too, Matsuda-kun!

245
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,518
Are you the victim?

246
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,728
Were you injured?

247
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,397
No. Pm not."

248
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,815
Knjiro-san !

249
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:41,149
After him!

250
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:41,274
After him!

251
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:41,524
After him!

252
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,275
Catch him!

253
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,735
Kajilro-saun. . .

254
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,945
Hold it right there-l

255
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,785
Yeah, the letter. .

256
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,579
I must Show the better to Yawara-san!

257
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,166
You're hurt, aren't you?

258
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,793
Should we get an ambulance?

259
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,294
Let me go!

260
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,296
I must go!

261
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,049
I need to file this reportw so
come to the aeculrity affine.

262
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:06,800


263
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,551
Let me go!

264
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,762
I must give Yawara-san the letter!

265
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:18,978


266
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,063


267
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:20,146


268
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:20,271


269
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:30,490


270
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,991
Stap it!

271
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,118
That's so mean.

272
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,202
It? too mean!

273
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,704
Stop them now!

274
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,747
What's the matter?

275
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,917
What is wrong, Yawara-san?

276
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,503
Dont you see?

277
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,006
Jody has hurt her leg.

278
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,132


279
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,345
Telsshikova has been attacking
it since the beginning.

280
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,526
Out of bounds!

281
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:06,860
W's-it!

282
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,487
This is not good for Rockwell!

283
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,781
She's being troubled by Teleshw'knva's footwork!

284
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,200
Fatty seconds left!

285
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,869
Maybe. . .

286
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,290
Maybe she's hurt her berg!

287
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,250
You finally realized that?

288
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,836


289
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,882
It was from that ouchi gari
than: the army cuit giwl did.

290
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,844
Jnody hurt her left knee again.

291
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,806
Really...

292
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,819
I can't lose.

293
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,989
To fight at the World Cup...

294
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,659
We promised. Yawara.

295
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,829


296
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,830

301
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,556
Rockwell has injured her beg!

302
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,893

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,143


306
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:22,310


307
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,902

00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:47,293

00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:14,988

321
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,373


322
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:25,999


323
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:28,626

00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,127

Son of a bitch!

333
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,157
Teleshikova somehow made it out of that mess.

Bun: fur Rockwell who has ixnjlured
her leg, that waza avri was huge!
