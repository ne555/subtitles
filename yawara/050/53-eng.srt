1
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,096
lnoukuma has a great advantage.

2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,306
Haw wizlll Teleshiknva retaliate?

3
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,516
Uraanage!

4
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,850
Watch out for umnage!

5
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,107


6
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:47,232
Waza ari!

7
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:47,982
Waza ari!

8
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,317
Out of bounds! Wait!

9
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:49,567
gaunt

10
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,115
Iwnokuma is not. ..

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,158
unokuwma is not getting up!

12
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,576
What: going on?!

13
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,662
Dad?

14
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,664
Get up!

15
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,749
Get up, Yawara!

16
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:05,250


17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,333


18
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,212
It is you, Dad!

19
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:10,797


20
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:10,880


21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,050
Get up, Yawara-san!

22
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,636
Get up!

23
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,054
Please get up!

24
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,597
Matsuda-san?

25
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,352
That's it!

26
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,520
Get up, Yawara-san!

27
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,647
Ma-tsudarsan?

28
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,067
I thought it was Dad's voice.

29
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,696
A very relaxing voice.

30
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,822
Matsuda-san...

31
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,532
Now, the match resumes.

32
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,576
l:nokuma seems to be spacing out a little.

33
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,577
Is she okay?

34
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:45,582
Yawara Inokuma, you would have been happier
if you had stayed down back there.

35
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,504
Continuous sweeps, just like in
the match against Rockwell!

36
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,757
Fight!

37
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,551
Fight, Yawara!

38
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,927
Jody!

39
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,181
Inukuma's ipzpon zeoi!

40
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
That i dint!

41
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,810
No, Telesh'nkova'x uravnage!

42
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,151

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,528
Shss dune it!

44
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,907
She has ovarcomne Tevleshikovai u-ranage!

45
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,035
OIn tap of that, she retavlaated with am ouchi gari!

46
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:28,291
Olh, Rockwell, who came to the main
hall dragging hner injured leg,

47
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,251
is now being carried out on a stretcher.

48
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,629
Bath an and off the stage,
the battle is heating up!

49
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,507
Who will come out victorious in
the women's free weight finals?

50
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,842
Teheshliko'va, or Ilnpoekulma?

51
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:45,141


52
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,267
You're unforgivable!

53
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,853
You hurt Jody's leg intentionally!

54
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,980


55
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,982
I've had enough!

56
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,570
Treating this match as a place for revenge!

57
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,613
Master !

58
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,198
Just wait, Jody.

59
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,533
I'll beat her in a minute!

60
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,410
Let me go, Yamashita!

61
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,541
I need to fix that stupid giwrl's
slacking spirit right now!

62
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,919
I know the mastery of judo you teach very welll!

63
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,382
But please let Ya-wara-san perfurm
her own judo for now!

64
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,383
Shut up!

65
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,761
I don't want her to put shame on
my judo with wch a match!

66
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,180
makuma's canto gari!


67
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,227
But Te-leshikova was too strong.

68
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,687
She retadiates with her own osom gari!

69
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,898
Wow!

70
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,609
lnoku ma's kata ngu ma!

71
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,079
Out of bounds! Wait!

72
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,668


73
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,003
Wow!

74
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,254
So close!

75
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,840
It wasn't close at all!

76
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,728
Iwon't...

77
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,021
I won't...

78
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,608
lose against anyone!

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,361
You'll stop the match?!

80
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,403
That's right.

81
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,989
Tell him to stnp!

82
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,200
What the heck are you thinking?!

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,954
At this rate, Yawara-san will
win with one extra yuko!

84
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:35,168
I've told you before, points and judge's
dadsiom don't count in my beak!

85
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,046
The only thing that matters is a victory by ilppon!

86
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,631
She w-i l.l!

87
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,051
I've never seen Yawaara-san so fired up!

88
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,304
Eat this park dump-ling and think care-fully!

89
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,016
Matsuda, how long have you been
fallloming after Ya'wara?

90
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,934
Now, watch that!

91
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,521
Does that look like the same Yawalra
ynu've devotedly followed?!

92
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,989
Look at those bioodshat eyes,
like a fighting dog's!

93
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,160
She's only fighting to take
revenge on Jody's behalf!

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,121
This is. not a match!

95
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,665
Watch, Jody!

96
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,217
I won't lose against anyone!

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,262
I can't afford to lose!

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,020
I'm not like you - I didn't receive the world's
top level training like you did!

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,188
My life is on this match.

100
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,232
This match is for those who have
supported me in my Iife!

101
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,988
I can't afford to lose against you!

102
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,244
Stopping my uranage won't stop me!

103
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,875
Teleshiknva's harali goshi!

104
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,628
Inokuma quickly breaks free!

105
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,755


106
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,176
lnoku ma is in danger!

107
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,678
Will Teleshiko'va take it to a floor howld?!

108
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,560
lnokuxma: tomoe nage!

109
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,690
Telesthilkova hangs in too!

110
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,360


111
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,237
Telesikma quickly takes it to a floour hold!

112
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,615
Nno, Inukuma escapes!

113
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,492
T-thlis is so...

114
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:37,457


115
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,125
They're both up!

116
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,794
Seeing such a wonderful match,

00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,506
the audience of Chang Chung Gymnasium
are all on their feet!

118

What is so wonderful about this?!

119
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,054
Snap out of it, Yawara!

120
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,890
I never taught you such judo-E

121
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,933

Let me go!
Wa-iut!

They both try their moves without any breaks!

125
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,032
There is less than a minute left!

126
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,617
Who wiIll be the winner?!

127
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,953
One more!

128
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:15,954

Yawam, the real game is still ahead.

148
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,846
There's now less than thirty seconds left!

They're still off-balance, will

168
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,202

You're the hen in the world!

193
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,013
This is it!

194
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,764
Oh, Yamashilta-san.

195
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:49,853
This is the Japanese answer to the world"? judo!

196
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,856
This is the an of "qu" slayllng "go."

197
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,775
Yawaxra. . .

198
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,778
Yawara...

199
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,780
Yeah... .

200
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,784
She really won...

201
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:10,081
She really became a super star.

202
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,667
Yawara-san...

203
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,758
You idiot!

204
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,509
Grandpa!

205
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,678
Let's go, you idiot!

206
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,181
That hurts!

207
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,766
Let me go. Grandpa!

208
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,726
Move!

209
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,228
How much longer are you going
to be a public shame?!

210
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,897
Here, bow!

211
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,857
Master !

212
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,442
What are you dating  Jigom-saan?!

213
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,443
Outta my wary!

214
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,402
We're going home!

215
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,654
Going home?!

216
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,156
No way!

217
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,991
We still have the award ceremony!

218
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,703
This is it, Yammhwita-san.

219
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,790
Teleshn'kova dodges lnozksuma's tai otashui.,

220
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,917
and as soon as she tries to take
Inokwma with ouchi garim

221
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,709
Yes!

222
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,127
A-t this moment!

223
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,297
lnokuwma is already in the stance for semi.

224
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,299
The timilng is perfect!

225
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,843
And here!

226
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,011
Right.

227
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,930
Teleshvilkova's large body goes in the ailr.

228
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,936
Mann, watching it on a slow motion replay
makes me realize how great she is.

229
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,022
Shefs ilncredllble. . .

230
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,275
I've never seen such a great ilppon moi.

231
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:26,741
linok'ulma! I'm extremeiy hapw!

232
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,328


233
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,164
The opponent's really flying!

234
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,375
How can she do that?

235
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,880
lit's became she's enjoying her life to the fullest.

236
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,175
Yawara, well done.

237
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,385
Yawara!

238
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,434
Mr. Inezkuma Kaiixro. right?

239
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,106
Please give us more details!

240
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,108
What's gating an?!

241
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,444
ms simple!

242
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,778
Vevry shameful!

243
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,571
We're going home-!

244
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,363
Right now!

245
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,283
You've been repeating youraelf about shame.

246
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,868
What was so shameful?

247
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,912
If you can't see it, I can't explain it either.

248
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,831
Yarwaara! Hurry up and change!

249
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:20,587
Her anger at what Teleshilkova did to Rockwell
was a sense of righuteousnnesm

250
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,588
That's not a shame.

251
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,425
The hall with righteousness!

252
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:30,638
If she's so shaft-sighted as to get
upset over something like that,

253
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,516
she doesn't need any gold medals!

254
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,100


255
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,478
Why are you so being stubborn?!

256
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,355
What abaut the award ceremony?!

257
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,981
Who willll accept the gold medal?

258
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,816
You go.

259
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,486
By the way, JigorOvsan,

260
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,323
is what you said in the commentatcar box true?

261
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,326
The reason Yawara-sa'n's fathevr,
Kojiro-san is missing

262
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,914
is due to the shock of being thrown
by S-yeanr'olvd Yawara-san.

263
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,832
Don't talk abouut that!

264
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,585
But if that's true, it's so drama-tic.

265
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,005
I'd like to know more details about that!

266
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,465
Yeah! Yeah!

267
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,760
You dont have to know anything about that!

268
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,053
Is that true?

269
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,394
So I really was the reason.

270
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,020
The reason he's gone...

271
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,854


272
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,814
Yawaura-san . . .

273
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,983
Grandpa, is it?

274
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,486


275
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,154
You didn't know?

276
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,448
How did you do it when you were five?

277
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,741
What kind of father was he?

278
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,660
I'm sure you've been lonely.

279
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,161
l'm sure it's been hard.

280
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,331
Stup it!

281
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,710
that has nothing to do with her victary today!

282
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,879
Can't you wriite articles about something
other than scandals?!

283
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,007
Shut up, Nikkann Every!

284
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,426
You're the one who writes
all the made-up stories!

285
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,178
Don't act cocky just because you
picked up the scoop first!

286
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,556
We're askiung Yawaa'msan!

287
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,724
Yeah!

288
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,516
Move out of the way!

289
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,143
Yawara-san E

290
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,608
Now, we're cammencing the medal ceremony for
the women's free weight class competition.

291
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,028
What happened to lnukwma?

292
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,112
Where's Yawara?

293
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:13,116
I hate this stuff...

294
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,236
Yawa ran-sand

295
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,823
I have to go to the hospital.

296
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,409
To see Jody.

297
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,800
At Barcelona",

298
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,595
At the Barcelona Olympics, lwill...

299
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:29,401


300
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,944
I will not continue judo anymore.

301
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,993
Because of my j-udo, my family is sca-ttared.

302
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,709
That's not true.

303
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:53,425
There are families who are separated,
even if they're living together.

304
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,343
With your family, you may
be separated physically,

305
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,428
but your hearts are together.

306
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,723
How can you tell?

307
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,850
I don't even know where my dad is now

308
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,729
I can't see her now.

309
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,907
A gold medal!

310
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,243
lnokuma of Japan wins the gold!

311
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:24,330
Coach Kazamatsuxri received the glorious
gold medal on her behalf.

312
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,375
She has done so well!

313
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,384
Give me more kalbi.

314
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,597
Is that...

315
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,890
Is that true?

316
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,891
Yes.

317
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,185
Your wait is over.

318
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,897
We have found Mr. Inokuma Kojiro in Seoul.

319
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,565
Very well.

320
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:54,027
Start the negotiatjans to have him as my coach.

321
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,237
I don't care how much it costs.

322
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,911
Now Barcelona wi ll become my Olympics.

323
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,831
Just watch, lnakuma Yawara!

324
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,754
Thank you, Matsuda-san.

325
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,219
When I fell unconsciuus from
Teleshikwa's uranage.

326
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,137
you calllled my name.


327
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,264
I was very happw.

328
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,141
Nah. . .

329
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,061
I thought it was Dad's voice.

330
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,980
Dad's?

331
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:55,630
Everything will be crazy once
we get back to Japan.

332
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,508
You're now a real superstar.

333
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,350
Um...

334
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,227
Do you remember?

335
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,939
One day, we made a pramise.

336
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,444
After the world cup was over, I wanted
m exclusive interview with you.

337
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,748

338

I like you.

342
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,443
How about...

343
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,695
Good job.

344
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:46,157


345
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:46,241


346
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:46,324

00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:46,491


349
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:46,574


350
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:46,658


351
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:46,741

00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:47,951


365
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:48,034


366
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:48,159


367
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,243
