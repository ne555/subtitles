00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,030
Women's judo will soon become an official Olympic event at Barcelona.

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,540
this tournament will be even more exciting.

The 8th Annual Ajisai Cup Women's Intermural Tournament.

6
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,050
Will the trophy go to the five-time champions, Tsukushi University?

7
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,410
Or to Seishin Women's School, led by Honami Sayaka?

8
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,510
Or to the biggest draw of the tournament,

00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,510
Sign: Mitsuba Women's Junior College#
Or to the biggest draw of the tournament,

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,000
Mitsuba Women's Junior College,
 led by world free-weight gold medalist,

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,820
Inokuma Yawara?

12
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,480
The Huge Obstacle

13
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,020
So how does our commentator Saito-san feel about this?
The Huge Obstacle

14
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,540
So how does our commentator Saito-san feel about this?

15
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,200
You saw Inokuma's judo up close and personal at the World Cup.

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,990
Yes, I did.

17
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,250
I have to say Inokuma is a fantastic competitor.

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,770
In fact, she's not only a magnificent player, but also a magnificent human being.

19
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,210
A fine woman indeed.


20
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,220
So what you're saying is that Inokuma is your type of woman, correct?

21
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,550
D-Don't be silly!

22
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,060
Oh, uh, forgive me!

23
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,660
Look at the crowds!

24
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,930
Hey, look, there are TV cameras!

25
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,440
Ah, one's pointing at us!

26
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,070
Oh my God, we're on TV!

27
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,280
Yay, yay!

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,240
Um, Inokuma-san?

29
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,280
I realized something just now.

30
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,900
I know I went ahead and started doing judo...

31
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,570
but I have absolutely no business being here!

32
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,550
I mean, everybody looks so strong that it's scary!

33
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,970
Don't worry. I know in my heart you'll win.

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
There's no use cheering me up!

35
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,900
I know I'm going to lose in an instant!

36
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,670
Hold on, Fujiko-san!

37
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,980
Please, Inokuma-san. Take the first spot and win it all for us.

38
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,950
That way we won't even have to set foot on the mat!

39
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,950
I can't do that.



40
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,230
You're the one who said we were going to fight together.

41
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,000
You have nothing to worry about.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,420
You'll definitely win with your Ouchi Gari.

43
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,490
I'm counting on you.

44
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,970
Y-You <i>are</i>?

45
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,010
Inokuma Yawara.</i>

46
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,860
Now that's scary!</i>

47
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,440
The Tsukushi University players are also scowling at me.</i>

48
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,370
Wow, we finally have the leading players together again.

49
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,380
If all goes well, Yawara-san will face Honami Sayaka in the semis.

50
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,390
It will be the fated rematch I've been anticipating for two years!

51
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,800
Two years ago...

52
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,570
Yawara won with an Ippon Zeoi.

53
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,980
Jigoro-san.

54
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,000
She also won by default against that heiress last year.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,240
However, this year, for her third attempt, Miss Sayaka will come out scratching and clawing.

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,010
However!

57
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,010
This year, she'll be facing a huge obstacle besides Yawara.

58
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,970
Even Miss Sayaka will find it a wee bit tough breaking through that wall.

59
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,020
Huh?

60
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,080
MWJC will present a huge obstacle even without Yawara.</i>

61
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,990
A huge obstacle?</i>

62
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,500
I don't see anyone like that among them.</i>

63
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,500
Still...</i>





64
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,460
She's become even more fetching.</i>

65
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,400
Yawara-san... What a woman.</i>

66
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,160
You were grinning!

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,130
And your nostrils were flaring.

68
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,440
You were thinking something dirty!

69
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,230
Who are you calling dirty?

70
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,980
You, mister!

71
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,460
Damn! I got completely tied up with morning practice!</i>

72
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,310
Fujiko-san! I'm coming!</i>

73
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,800
Hanazono Kaoru is coming for you!</i>

74
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,070
The first matches are finally about to start!

75
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,890
In Ring A will be last year's champions, Tsukushi University, against Tosaka Women's College.

76
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,570
In Ring B will be Seishiro University against Honami Sayaka's Seishin Women's School.

77
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,080
Don't take your eyes off either of these matches.

78
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,940
So first off...

79
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,440
we'll see what the young miss is made of, huh?

80
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,700
First players forward!

81
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,490
I'll be going.

82
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,240
Please take care.

83
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,130
I will.

84
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,870
The day has finally come.</i>

85
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,320
I've waited so long.</i>

86
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,630
Hajime!





87
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,130
I can practically see our decisive match right in front of me.</i>

88
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,640
I can still recall attaining every imaginable glorious achievement three years ago,</i>

89
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,680
and how awfully bored I was.</i>

90
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,490
That is, until I came to know that damned thorn in my side, Inokuma Yawara!</i>



91
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,080
That's not to say my teenage life didn't become more exciting.</i>

92
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,860
So I'll at least give her that.</i>

93
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,710
However, there's only so much I can stand.</i>

94
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,240
I'll be be taking over the Honami conglomerate,</i>

95
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
so I'll be studying how to be a queen.</i>

96
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,780
In England!</i>

97
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,740
And I'll be taking Kazamatsuri-san with me.</i>

98
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,560
Sayaka-san! Sayaka-san! Sayaka-san!

99
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,660
Are our opponents even women?

100
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,530
They grabbed my collar and I, a fifth degree calligrapher, couldn't do anything!

101
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,530
So what happened?

102
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,990
Sayaka-san, please be careful! Our opponents are violent!

103
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,580
M-My chest hurts! My chest!

104
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,250
Jeeves, call the physician!

105
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,150
How pathetic.

106
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,000
So I see you four have lost already.

107
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,470
My appearance is eliciting loud cheers.

108
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,570
Yes!

109
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,020
She's too strong!

110
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,480
Ogaki, number one for Tsukushi University, plows through four players!

111
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,570
Vulgar cheers for someone who only defeated four players.

112
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,440
Very well, you'll all have the pleasure of seeing me defeat <i>five</i> players.

113
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,530
Seishin Women's School Captain, come forward!

114
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,220
Don't call me "Captain."

115
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,280
Call me "Queen."





116
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,710
One down!

117
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,710
Two down!

118
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,210
Three down!

119
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,580
Ippon!

120
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,380
Four down!
Ippon!

121
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,550
Wow!

122
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,390
That girl has definitely read my book.

123
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,360
Ippon!

124
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,150
Done!

125
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,920
A-And that's five down!

126
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
Honami Sayaka overpowers five players!

127
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,390
She's still alive and kicking!

128
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,120
Up till now, Inokuma has eclipsed her,

129
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,090
but she's giving us a long-awaited demonstration of her magnificent moves!

130
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,140
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

131
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,720
Meanwhile in Ring A, Tsukushi University isn't giving their opponent an inch!

132
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,520
All right!

133
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,210
Yes! We're going to the second round!

134
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,020
Inokuma Yawara...</i>

135
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,030
Inokuma Yawara!</i>

136
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,020
They're glaring at us!

137
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,000
Mm-hmm.

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,990
I'm scared!

139
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,070
Is everyone looking at us?

140
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,040
Peace! Peace!

141
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,040
The third match of the first round will be

142
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Mitsuba Women's Junior College vs. Wagadzuma Women's College.

143
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,550
Yay! We're on!

144
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,850
I-I knew it. We've come to an awful place!

145
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,610
Fujiko-san!

146
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,130
Don't cry.

147
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,970
Fujiko-san, you're making me cry!

148
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,350
MWJC?

149
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,020
That's Inokuma!

150
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,610
Inokuma's coming!

151
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,130
Finally!

Inokuma! Take 'em down in one!

156
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,000
Show us your gold-medal-winning Ippon Zeoi!

157
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,960
Let's go, Fujiko-san! We're on!

158
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,820
I-I can't!

159
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,050
My legs are cramped!

160
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,630
Fujiko-san.


161
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,860
They say if you write "person" on your hand and swallow it, it'll be good for you.

162
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,260
I already did that over and over again!

163
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,130
I must've swallowed 300 people!


164
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,230
Y-Your stomach must be full then.

165
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,240
MWJC, line up!

166
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,120
Yes, we're coming!

167
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,380
Bow!

168
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,460
The match between MWJC and Wagadzuma College is about to start!

169
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,360
They'll win, won't they?

170
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,960
Yeah, because Yawara-san is our Goddess of Victory.

171
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,420
We may have another Goddess of Victory standing tall beside Yawara.

172
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,900
Eh?

173
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,410
So that's Inokuma?

174
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,200
We can't win against her Ippon Zeoi.

175
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Idiots, what are you afraid of?




176
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,610
But Coach!

177
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,850
Look at the other players from MWJC!

178
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,520
They're all white belts!

179
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,350
Which means we only have to worry about Inokuma,

180
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,070
and there's a good chance you five can beat her!

181
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,770
Yeah, you're right.

182
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,600
Get 'em, Murakami!

183
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,440
All right!

184
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,460
Here's Paddy-field!

185
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,190
Don't hog all the attention.

186
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,460
You might not even get a chance.

187
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Bow!

188
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,390
Paddy-field, hang in there!

189
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,740
Fujiko-san! Breathe!

190
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,730
Fujiko-san.

191
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,410
It's okay.

192
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,450
We have you on our side.

193
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,870
Don't say that!



194
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,770
You've practiced your heart out. You'll win!

195
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,650
But this is a real match!

196
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,670
Kenji, you jerkwad!

197
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,170
Ippon!

198
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,670
Yahoo!

199
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,690
I won! I won! I won! Yeah, I won!

200
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,680
Hey, you still have to bow!

201
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,610
Paddy-field won!

202
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,930
No way!

203
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,550
That was a magnificent Deashi Barai, Saito-san.

204
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,380
Yes, this is what I call a real "butting of heads."

205
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,900
That timing, that edge... She must've gotten them from Inokuma Yawara!

206
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,510
According to these documents, every other MWJC player besides Inokuma Yawara

207
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,570
has only played judo for a little over three months,

208
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,860
but looking at the way she stays in the game...

209
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,130
Katsuya, you jerkwad!

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,690
She's not just staying in the game, she's the real deal!

211
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,510
That's two down!

212
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,510
Is she the one?</i>

213
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,020
Is she the huge obstacle Kojiro-san was talking about?</i>

214
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,640
Unbelievable.</i>

215
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,270
Her move was smooth, despite only three months of judo experience.</i>

216
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,950
You are truly frightening, Yawara-san.</i>

217
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,980
You are truly frightening, Inokuma Jigoro!</i>

218
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,990
This is bad, very bad indeed, Sayaka-san!</i>

219
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,660
Huh?

220
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Ippon!

221
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,720
Oh no, she lost.</i>

222
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,670
Kojiro-san, I don't think she's as big an obstacle as you said.</i>

223
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh God...






224
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,630
That's awesome, Paddy-field! Defeating two is a huge feather in your cap!

225
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,720
So does that mean their second player is the obstacle?

226
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,180
MWJC, second player!

227
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,130
Here!

228
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,100
Oh my God!

229
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,980
I can tell immediately she's not just any woman!

230
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Though it's a different set of assets that has me worked up.

231
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,660
Is that...

232
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,500
That's not a T-shirt!

233
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,040
She's wearing a tank top!

234
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,730
Marilyn, attack her!

235
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,050
Not that I'm expecting much, but good luck anyway!

236
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,140
This is great!

237
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,970
Keep it going!

238
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,760
Damn!

239
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,480
And I wanted to see a little more.





240
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,230
She was exciting to watch, but she's definitely not the one.

241
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,240
You bimbo, quit acting cute for the cameras and get off the mat!

242
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,240
I wonder how much weight I'll lose today?

243
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,380
Yoshinagawa-san, don't rush it!

244
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,160
Remember the timing you mastered during practice!

245
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,230
I-I'm next!

246
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,230
My turn will finally come! What'll I do?

247
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,810
My heart's about to leap out of my mouth!

248
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,210
Hanazono-san!</i>

249
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,800
Fujiko-san!</i>

250
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,580
Don't forget your un, deux, trois!</i>

251
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,580
You're a natural talent!</i>

252
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,950
And I'm here for you!</i>

253
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,670
Fujiko-san, Fujiko-san!

254
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,280
Fujiko-san, look!

255
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,180
She's unyielding!

256
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,300
The third player for MWJC, Yoshinaga Sayuri...

257
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,540
I mean, Yoshinagawa Sayuri, has her in a crushing Tate Shihoh Gatame!

258
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,680
Way to go, Sayuri!



259
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,000
Obliterate her!

260
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,010
I see. So she's the one!

261
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,050
And I can see she's a <i>huge</i> obstacle.

262
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,800
Tighten up around your knees! Don't let her break free!

263
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,060
Only six seconds left!

264
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,230
Ippon! Done!

265
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,900
MWJC's white belts are frightening to behold!

266
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,510
Have I lost three kilos?

267
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,060
You're hurting me. Move it!

268
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,030
Wow, Yawara-san made her stronger just by practicing with her!

269
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,250
It's the fruits of my coaching.

270

271
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,240
It's turning out to be an unexpectedly close match for Wagadzuma.

Vice Captain Katsuragi will now be stepping onto the mat!

273
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,160
She got her with an Osaekomi.

274
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,510
I need to get Sayaka-san and rework our plan!



275
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,860
Wagadzuma Vice Captain Katsuragi has put her in a quick Kata Hajime!

276
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,450
Inokuma-san, do something!

277
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,860
But her hold's too perfect!

278
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,560
Ippon! Done!

279
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,860
Yoshinagawa-san.

280
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,340
Looks like she knows how to give up now.

281
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,340
So the huge obstacle isn't that corpulent girl?</i>

282
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,360
That means...</i>

283
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,310
I-I'm next!</i>

284
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,750
You can do it, Fujiko-san!



285
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,850
Get 'em, Fujiko-san!

286
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,690
MWJC vs. Wagadzuma College.

287
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,320
It's now a face-off between the two vice captains!

288
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,220
Sh-She's... tall!

289
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,320
B-Bow!

290
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,070
MWJC will present a huge obstacle even without Yawara.</i>

291
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,790
If she's the huge obstacle, there's no hope for them.</i>

292
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,740
She's scared stiff. She won't put up much of a challenge.</i>

293
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,520
Hajime!

294
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,550
Fujiko-san, relax! Relax your shoulders!

295
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,940
Fujiko-san!



296
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,940
It's no use! I've forgotten everything I did in practice!</i>

297
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,980
Fujiko-san!

298
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,450
H-Hanazono-san?</i>

299
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,200
Un, deux, trois!

300
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,810
Un, deux, trois... Un, deux, trois...</i>

301
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,140
Un, deux, trois!</i>

302
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,320
Un, deux, trois! 

303
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,360
Un, deux, trois! 

304
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,000
Un, deux, trois! 

305
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,090
I-Ippon! Done!

306
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,890
Yay!

307
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,550
That's our Fujiko-san!

308
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,100
You're on fire, Fujiko-san!

309
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,430
So she's the huge obstacle?

310
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,510
Fujiko-san has really powered up!

311
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,210
Fujiko-san!

312
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,130
That's not all she's got.

313
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,860
Once you get that beanpole's engine running,

314
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,860
she packs an even more fearsome Ouchi Gari.

315
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,310
Wagadzuma College is down to their last player!

316
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,060
Their captain, Shirakawa, is now up!

317
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,160
But if she beats MWJC Vice Captain Ito here, she still has to deal with Inokuma!

318
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,540
Go ahead and lose, Beanpole!

319
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,550
Lose!

320
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,980
Your work here is done!

321
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,750
Put her in!
Your work here is done!

322
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,230
Let Inokuma play!

323
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,560
Let us see Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi!

324
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,390
Take a fall!

325
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,690
Fujiko-san, don't forget that timing!

326
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,390
Give 'em another un, deux, trois!

327
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,610
Hajime!

328
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,230
Fujiko-san!

329
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,740
Relax your shoulders, Fujiko-san!

330
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,410
They're right.</i>

331
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,230
I should just lose here.</i>

332
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,160
We have Inokuma-san.</i>

333
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,700
That's right! If I lose, we still have Inokuma-san!</i>

334
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,250
It's okay if I lose!</i>

335
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,970
Oh, she's gotten more relaxed!

336
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,800
Hey, doncha get it? You're supposed to lose!

337
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,680
We get it. You white belts are actually good!

338
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,260
Now leave the rest to Inokuma!

339
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,940
I know. I'm going to lose now!</i>

340
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,740
Come on. Throw me down hard!</i>

341
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,020
Fujiko-san!

342
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,200
Un, deux, trois!

343
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,530
Fine! Un...</i>

344
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,200
Deux...

345
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,290
Trois!

346
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,960
Ippon!

347
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Done!

348
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,440
All right!

349
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,970
We won the first round!

350
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,480
You did it, Fujiko-san!

351
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,530
Did I... just win?

352
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,780
This is simply incredible!

353
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,920
MWJC advances to the second round without the aid of Inokuma Yawara!

She doesn't dilly-dally in practice like you do!

359
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,400
Still, the war's not over by a long shot.

360
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,120
That's because we're gonna face those army tanks led by Tohdoh Yuki.

361
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,700
Will we be all right?

362
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,520
Stay tuned and watch!

363
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,530

364
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,340
