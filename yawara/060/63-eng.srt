I've loved him.

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,160
I've always been waiting.

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,130
I showed off whenever he was around.

I do think they're both important.

I know it's what I want the most.

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes! Give her the taste of your Konaki-jiji!

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,140
Come on! Get out of it!

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,880
Good!
Come on! Get out of it!

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,580
Get out from the side!

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,460
That's it! Go, Kurokawa!

27
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,720
Ude-hishigi-juji-gatame!

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,060
Ow!

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,520
Let me go! That hurts! Let me go!

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,450
You have to give up!

31
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,020
You need to give up right now!

32
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,020
Your arm's going to break.

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:20,030
Secret Technique! Swan Lake!!

34
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,530
You forgot to teach her how to give up?!

35
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,130
At this rate, her arm could break.

36
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,410
Th-That's not good.

37
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,540
Crap! We need to stop the match.

38
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,910
Ow!

39
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,780
That hurts!

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,060
Don't lose, Sayuri!
That hurts!

41
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,500
Take her down, Sayuri!

42
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,780
I don't think she has a chance anymore.

43
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,390
She did her best, though.

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,260
Inokuma-san, please hurry!

45
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,270
Come on, that hurts! Let me go!

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,770
I don't get it. Why doesn't she give up? She should.

47
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,820
Let me go! Let me go!

48
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,400
Why? Why don't you give up?

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,910
Hurry. You have to give up.

50
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,640
Ow! Let me go! Let me go!

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,030
That hurts!

52
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,400
Goodness, I can't watch this anymore.

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,420
I have to go inside and stop this!

54
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,640
Let me go!

55
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,600
No way!

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,670
She got out of it!

57
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,920
Must be an adrenaline rush or something.

58
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,830
U-Unbelievable.

59
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,730
She doesn't know her own limits.

60
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,070
Good job!

61
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,410
Nice one!

62
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,240
You're amazing! That was great, Yoshinagawa-san!

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,410
Not conceding the match until the very end.

64
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,950
Inokuma Jigoro's judo is truly terrifying.

65
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,750
This is the spirit of "Never give up"!

66
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,040
Hajime!

67
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,050
I'm tired of this!

68
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,050
Ow!

69
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,300
No! Get away!

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,310
It's a perfect Okuri-eri-jime.


71
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,790
All she does is these stupid holds!

72
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,830
She's playing dirty!

73
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,360
Th-That's good enough! Please, just stop!

74
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,610
Push her right elbow up,
then take your head out.

75
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,200
Well, do you give up?

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,490
Yes! She gives up!

77
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,790
S-Stop! That's the match.

78
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,350
Her shoulder's a little dislocated from getting out of the Ude-hishigi.

79
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,760
Stop crying. I'll fix you up right now.

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,650
There, now you're healed.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,190
I can't do this!

82
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,780
I don't want to be in so much pain!

83
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,570
I don't want to do judo ever again!

84
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,270
You know, you lost a lot of weight from that match.

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,820
Your arm looks half as thick now.

86
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,770
Really?


87
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,400
Hey, did I really lose weight?

88
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,660
Yeah, definitely!

89
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,970
And I lost weight just from watching you.

90
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,030
You gave more than your best.

91
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,940
Awesome!

92
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,620
They're cheering even though they lost.

93
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm sure they have nothing to cry about after a match like that.

94
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,210
We could learn a lot
from Master Inokuma's judo.


95
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,630
Wow, they're all working so hard.

96
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,140
Next up, MWJC, number three, Oda Mari-kun.

97
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,850
Okay!

98
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,210
She's wearing makeup.

99
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,000
Pink sash and earrings.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
And she isn't wearing a bra or T-shirt.

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,800
Wh-What's with that outfit?!

102
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,030
What? I'm in my judo uniform.

103
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,120
Get into proper attire, then come back.

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,370
Oh, please. This is proper attire.

105
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,410
Yeah, just let her go!

106
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,420
Don't be so strict. Let's get the match started.

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,340
See? They're all fine with it.

108
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,920
No! No good! Put on a T-shirt!

109
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,420
Why? What's wrong with the way I look?

110
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,890
W-Well...

111
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,680
Please, tell me. Please? Please?

112
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,010
Referees!

113
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,510
Damn it. Mari just loves making guys uncomfortable.

114
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,490
But this is a great idea!

115
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,050
Marilyn-chan wouldn't last a second once the match starts.

116
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,950
This is a much better way to buy time.



117
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,650
Hurry up and start!

118
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,000
There's no point in talking about it!

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,970
It's just a practice match!

120
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,300
Start the match! Start the match! Start the match!

121
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,880
Start the match! Start the match!



122
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,260
Make sure you guys
don't miss all the good stuff.

123
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,510
Oh, we won't.

124
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,480
MWJC Oda Mari, disqualified!

125
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,740
That's not fair!

126
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Stingy ref.

127
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,240
What? Why? Why? Why?

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,680
What are they thinking?

129
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,240
They must be insane.

130
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,120
No, we're dealing with Master Inokuma Jigoro.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,210
There must be a very deep meaning behind it.

132
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,030
Damn.

133
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,840
I didn't get to see her boobs.

134
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,970
That's good.

135
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,010
There was no way she could've competed in a real match.

136
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,800
Wait, doesn't that mean...

137
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,640
MWJC, Vice Captain, Ito Fujiko-kun!

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,810
Y-Yes, sir!

139
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,980
Fujiko-san, good luck.

140
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,160
Throw them one by one!

141
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Kyonkyon, don't worry.

142
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,260
I'll never let you go out.

143
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,570
I'll do my best to hold on until Inokuma-san comes.



144
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,700
Please do.

145
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,580
I wouldn't survive a match against any of them.

146
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,960
L-Leave it to me.

147
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,030
Fujiko-san!

148
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,380
Just like we practiced!

149
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,680
You'll win!

150
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,850
Hanazono-san...

151
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
I hope Fujiko-san will be all right.

152
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,420
She's tall.

153
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,620
S-She's tall.

154
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,030
She must be really good.

155
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,030
That Captain's probably just sitting in until Inokuma comes.

156
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,830
That would mean this tall girl is second to Inokuma.

157
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,290
Be careful with her, Kurokawa!

158
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,180
Bow.

159
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,360
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

160
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,100
What do I do, Inokuma-san?

161
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,720
Please come right now! Please!

162
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,770
Hajime!

163
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,360
I can't do this like I practiced!

164
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,940
I can hardly stand!

165
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,400
Fujiko-san!

166
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,910
H-Help me!

167
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,990
You got it!
Fujiko-san, take her down.



168
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,910
Avenge us!

169
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,230
Kurokawa, don't rush the match!

170
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,410
Stay cautious!

171
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,550
Fujiko-san, don't get too stiff! Relax!

172
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,010
Yuko!

173
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,520
Wow, she's flexible!

174
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,010
A-Amazing!

175
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,530
That would've been an Ippon.

176
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,470
She really is a former ballerina.

177
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,520
Fujiko-san! Get on all fours! She's going to try to hold you down!

178
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,570
Please stop!

179
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,030
I can't lose until Inokuma-san comes!

180
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,560
Mate!

181
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,890
I won't last a minute like this.

182
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,780
Inokuma-san, you're really amazing.

183
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,510
You're so good at this, and I'm scared out of my wits.

184
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,970
What should I do?

185
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,010
At this rate, Fujiko-san's going to lose!

186
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,010
Hajime!

187
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,760
Watch out! Fujiko-san!

188
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,390
It's an Osoto-gari!

189
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,850
Nice, she dodged it!

190
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,120
Outside! Mate!

191
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,320
What a flexible body,
and such amazing balance!



192
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,670
Matsuda-san, isn't she amazing?

193
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,680
Isn't she just amazing?

194
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,830
Yeah, I never thought her ballet
experience would prove so useful!

195
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,210
But...

196
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,390
She can't win if she doesn't attack.

197
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,340
Yes, of course!

198
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,840
Fujiko-san, attack! Remember the practice!

199
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,350
Fujiko-san!

200
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,690
If she loses, it's over.

201
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,600
Please hurry up, Yawara-san.

202
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,570
No, I can't stand anymore! No more!

203
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,610
Fujiko-san.

204
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,610
Mate!

205
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Yawara-san, hurry!

206
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,120
Shido!

207
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,400
She took a Yuko and now a Shido!

208
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,090
Attack, Fujiko-san!

209
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,090
Hajime!

210
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,640
Please, Inokuma-san...

211
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,800
Please hurry!

212
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,870
Yawara-san...

213
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,580
Damn it, Yawara-san, what are you doing?!

214
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,570
Fujiko-san!

215
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,030
Inokuma-san, hurry!

219
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,660
Attack!

220
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,460
Fujiko-san, you have to attack!

221
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,460
A-Attack how?

222
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,420
Remember our practice!

223
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,510
I know you can do it!

224
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,720
I can't just do it!

225
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,720
It's un, deux, trois! Don't forget the un, deux, trois!

226
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
O-Of course! What are you doing, Fujiko?

227
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,230
It's just un, deux, trois!

228
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:52,080
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois!

229
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,900
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois!

230
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,050
Un, deux, trois!

231
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,760
Un, deux, trois!

232
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,070
Ippon!

233
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,070
Nice one!

234
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,490
I...

235
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,160
You won!

236
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,540
You won, Fujiko-san!

237
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,750
Awesome! Swan Lake technique, unleashed!

238
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,670
That was cool!
Awesome! Swan Lake technique, unleashed!

239
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,920
Y-Yay!

240
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Wow! Amazing, Fujiko-san!

241
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,290
Tsukushi University, number three, Uzaki Megumi-kun.

242
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,470
Yes, sir.

243
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,550
Uzaki, that was an Ouchi-gari, right?

244
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,700
Yeah. Why do you ask?

245
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,900
W-Well, I couldn't tell where her leg came from.

246
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,020
Goodness, don't scare me.

247
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,800
Sh-She looks strong.


248
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,490
I'm probably done for this time.

249
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,310
All right, tall girl! Give them another one!

250
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,120
Inokuma Jigoro 7-dan, I'm sorry for the late introduction.

251
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,590
I'm Ishikura, the coach of the Tsukushi University women's judo team.

252
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,970
I'm an 8-dan.


253
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,510
Oh, Inokuma 8-dan, it's an honor to meet you.

254
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,240
Well, have some of this, and let's watch together.

255
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,120
Thank you.

256
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,620
By the way, Master, what an amazing judoka.

257
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,820
Who, me?

258
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,040
Oh, no, I mean her.

259
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,020
Oh, you think so too?

260
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,140
Yes, that height and motor function...

261
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,310
Not only is she flexible, she has great rhythm and speed.

262
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,490
She's amazingly talented.

263
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,490
Hajime!

264
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,710
Inokuma-san, help me!

265
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,160
No! Get away from her!

266
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,900
It's not safe to be stuck!

267
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,940
Get away!

268
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,720
Your shouts won't reach her from here.

269
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,340
Matsuda-san...

270
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,720
Inokuma-san!

271
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,230
Fujiko-san! Un, deux, trois again!

272
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,900
Yeah, un, deux, trois...

273
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,730
That's all I can do to hold on until Inokuma-san comes!

274
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,840
Master Inokuma, it must've taken years to get her to this level.

275
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,030
Wait, you don't mean it only took a year?

276
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,580
No, it only took one month.

277
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,580
O-One month?!

278
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,250
Un, deux, trois!

279
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,300
Come on, let's go inside with everyone else.

280
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,820
Waza-ari!

281
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,810
Sh-She's only been in judo for a month?

282
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,040
That's right.

283
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,710
She hardly knows the first thing about judo.




284
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,020
That's ridiculous.

285
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,900
In fact, she only knows how to throw an Ouchi-gari.

286
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,420
She doesn't know anything else.

287
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,290
What, she didn't win?

288
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,010
That's called a Waza-ari.

289
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,380
And why isn't that a win?

290
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,330
I don't know.

291
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,300
Don't tell me...

292
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,300
It's just like Kurokawa said.

293
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,260
Her leg comes out of nowhere in her Ouchi-gari.

294
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,260
Inokuma-san, please hurry.

295
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,760
If I lose, Kyonkyon will have to fight.

296
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,630
Fujiko-san, you've already won with a Waza-ari.

297
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,070
Just stay away from her!

298
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,850
Oh no, you won't!

299
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,780
Hajime!

300
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,780
Come on, Yawara-san.

301
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,290
But there are so many reporters.

302
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,250
Give me a break!

303
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,960
Can't you see how hard Fujiko-san's working?

304
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,260
Who do you think she's doing it for?

305
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,260
She's doing it for you.

306
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,260
Inokuma-san, please hurry!

307
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,040
That's it! Keep attacking!

308
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,730
Take back the Waza-ari!

309
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,970
I know.

310
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,770
But it's so hard to do anything to her.

311
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,780
Her judo doesn't feel normal at all.

312
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,320
It's like it's not judo at all. What is it?

313
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,240
She's a former ballerina?

314
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,430
Yes. Ballet is quite a terrifying dance.

315
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,020
Did you know that?

316
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,750
No, not at all.

317
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,710
But, have all the other members just been in judo for a month?

318
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,260
Yes. They're all complete beginners at judo.

319
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,360
Sign: Beginners

320
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,720
Unbelievable!
Sign: Beginners

321
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,380
Unbelievable!

322
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,670
That's ridiculous!

323
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,210
The national champions have been struggling against beginners?!

324
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,310
A-And if Inokuma Yawara shows up, we'll be...

325
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,610
If? She's already standing behind you.

326
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,720
She's only seconds away from this place.

327
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,510
E-Excuse me.

328
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,580
This is terrible!

329
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:33,000
If these reporters find out that we lost to complete beginners, we'll be disgraced.

330
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,320
That should make them take this a little more seriously.

331
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,210
Now, stop wasting my time
and come out, Yawara.

332
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
She's doing it for me?

333
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,040
That's right.


334
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,670
Fujiko-san worked her butt off and formed a judo team...

335
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,760
so that you could return to judo whenever you want to.

336
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,830
She's not the only one.

337
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,290
Hanazono-kun, Jody...

338
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,420
They all want you back in judo!

339
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,580
But... But I'm done with judo.

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,080
And I also want you...

341
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,630
Ah, that is, I-I want to write articles on you!

342
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,810
You know, I mean...

343
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,340
You want to cover me again?

344
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,140
Anyway, let's go in!

345
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,640
So you can write about me?

346
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,140
That's not it!

347
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,110
This isn't the time to be arguing over something so irrelevant! Why can't you understand?

348
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,840
Do whatever you want!

349
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,830
Uzaki! This is it! Hurry up and finish her!

350
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,600
She only has Ouchi-gari up her sleeve!

351
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,030
What?
She only has Ouchi-gari up her sleeve!

352
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,080
She only has Ouchi-gari up her sleeve!

353
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,590
Now, just finish the match! Or Inokuma will get here!

354
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,780
She can only do Ouchi-gari?

355
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,090
Then...

356
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,340
Oh no! Harai-goshi!

357
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,390
I can't let Kyonkyon fight.

358
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,560
Yuko.

359
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,810
Close.

360
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,600
You got it! Do another one!

361
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,450
She's hard to throw,

362
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,550
because she's tall and flexible.

363
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,110
Damn it! Just do something and finish her!

364
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,950
Kyonkyon, don't worry.

365
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,120
I'll do my best until Inokuma-san comes.

366
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,380
Fujiko-san...

367
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,040
Oh no! It's a Sode-tsurikomi-goshi!

368
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,380
Good! Nice dodge!

369
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,200
Fujiko-san! You're truly amazing!

370
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,550
Just one minute!
Hold out for one more minute!

371
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,410
Hey, what happens once time runs out?

372
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,820
If Fujiko-san doesn't lose a Waza-ari, then she'll win.

373
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,810
Then she just has to stay away?

374
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,740
I see, she can just stay away!

375
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,280
Fujiko-san, just stay away!

376
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,710
Come on back here!

377
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,840
Um...

378
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,120
Can't you see how hard Fujiko-san's working?

379
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,230
Who do you think she's doing it for?

380
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,010
Damn it!

381
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,260
Uzaki! You only have thirty seconds left!

382
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,480
Stop wasting time!

383
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,690
Damn it!

384
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,190
I can't.... I can't last thirty seconds.

385
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,040
I-I'm sorry, Kyonkyon.

386
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,950
Kyonkyon!

387
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,460
One, two, three... One, two, three...

388
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,170
Kyonkyon's getting ready for a match.

389
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,780
Just twenty more seconds!

390
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,100
Don't stop attacking!

391
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,100
If you don't hurry,
Inokuma Yawara will get here!

392
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,600
Just keep defending and you'll win, Fujiko-san!

393
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,730
Damn it!

394
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,700
Kyonkyon, are you really going to fight?

395
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,440
You can't! You'll be killed!

396
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,030
You...!

397
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,490
Inokuma-san, please come! Hurry!

398
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,000
Inokuma-san! Please!

399
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,970

400
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,140
Keep it up, Fujiko-san!

401
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:07,740
The tall one's holding out pretty well, but I don't teach judo that doesn't get Ippons.

402
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,070
It's starting to look a bit dangerous.

403
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,740
Fujiko-san, watch out!

404
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,110
Yawara!

405
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,280
I think I'll try.

406
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,910
If you don't watch,
I'll throw a Harai-goshi on you.

407
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,290
I Think I'll Try
If you don't watch,
I'll throw a Harai-goshi on you.

408
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,920
I Think I'll Try

409
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,800
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

410
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:47,120
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru

411
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,700
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.
hitonami no kousaten senaka osarenagara

412
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:03,910
We climb an endless hill, just you and me.
sakamichi wo doko made mo anata to aruita

413
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:13,290
I want to say "I love you" to the one I truly want,
naze hoshii mono wo "daisuki" to

414
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:20,600
But why can I not? I really don't know.
koe ni dashite ienai no?

415
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,360
You're standing here by my side.
ima anata ga iru

416
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:36,570
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:43,640
"Please don't let go of the hand you're holding,"
"tsunaideru sono yubi wo hanasanaide..."

418
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:51,000
I say as I look for your smile.
