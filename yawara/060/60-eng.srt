Superb!

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,420

I've found an amazing person!

I'm sorry, Jody.

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,910
That can't be true!

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,810
You can't really be quitting judo!

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,910

Thanks a lot.

I don't carry any money,
 because I'll just spend it on food.

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,290
It's my pleasure. Now just relax and eat your fill.

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,680
Still, are you sure that judo can help me diet?

45
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
Sure it can!


46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,180

These girls are willow-thin thanks to judo!

Well, I've always looked this good.

Yeah, good for a slut.

Why not just say you're jealous?

But we still haven't had any judo pract—

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,150
See? So let's do judo together!

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,760
Well?

56
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,720
Um...

57
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,100
Can I have another pork cutlet bowl?

I knew you could do it, Jody Rockwell.

Inokuma Yawara has made her comeback!

Someone with a thick accent.

73
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,420
Jody!

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,800
You did great, Jody! Gold medal material!

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,600
Thank you very much!

76
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,640
Matsuda, what should I do?

77
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,310
That was the last Ippon Seoinage she'll ever do!

78
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,520
She said she's going to quit judo!

79
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,880
It's because her dad will never return if she keeps it up.

80
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,900
She said her family was torn apart because of her judo.


81
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,890
She's really serious about quitting.

82
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,850
What should I have done, Matsuda?

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,860
You're the only one I can count on!

84
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,880
You're her steady, Matsuda,
 so you're the only one I can trust.

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,220
What the heck?

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,250

87
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,730

I finally have my five-member patchwork team!

We're not patchwork, are we?

91
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,820
You're right. We're a terrific team.

Oh, of course! It's just a stupid application form!

96
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,360
It's just a formality. As long as we know your name...

Oh my, that looks perfect on you, Dad.

103
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,290
You look ten years old.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,790
And you look just like the day you married my son.

105
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,710
Oh, you're making me blush.

106
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,590
Careful, this is hot!





107
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,690
Oh, Dad.

108
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:12,110
I hope you kept up your training while you were in Canada, Yawara.

109
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,660
So did you toss around ten or twenty bears?

110
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,290
I didn't see a single bear.

111
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,810
Geez...

112
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,230
So how was Jody-san's wedding?

113
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,790
It was wonderful!

114
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,900
Really?

115
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,400
Yawara, you had yourself a truly splendid rival.

116
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,700
Jody will get over the ordeal she suffered at the World Cup

117
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,330
and come back one or even two sizes bigger.

118
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,270
You need to start training immediately for that day!

119
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,350
What?


120
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,850
Oh, Dad, that's right! Zen-san from the electronics store left a message for you.

121
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,820
Oh, I forgot! I'm supposed to watch a video today!

122
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,930
Tamao-san! Do you know where my medal is?

123
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,700
I'm pretty sure it's in the bathroom.

124
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,980
Grandpa, please stop wearing that medal!

125
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,940
I'm off!

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,310
Grandpa!

127
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,670
Here's your present.

128
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,650
Thank you, Inokuma-san.

129
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,210
No, thank you.

130
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,200
Those notes you took for me really helped a lot.

131
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,820
A Canadian Rockies T-shirt!

132
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,680
I knew the Rockies would be perfect for you.

133
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,330
I heard we have afternoon classes off.

134
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,600
Do you want to go someplace?

135
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,710
Eh?

136
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,400
I-I'm afraid I'm...

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,410
Canada had such beautiful scenery that I couldn't stop taking pictures.

138
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,550
Do you want to see?

139
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,910
Today's not going to work out.

140
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,390
Huh?

141
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,830
Fujiko-san, your bag is open.

142
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,270
Huh?

143
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,760
My judogi!

144
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,760
Um, Fujiko-san?



145
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,730
Look, I'm really busy today. Sorry!

146
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,790
Fujiko-san! I haven't seen you for a while...

147
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,220
and I wanted to chat.

148
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,640
Look, right here! Right at that moment!

149
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,520
Take a good look!

150
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,060
You see?

151
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,090
Well?

152
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,140
Wow, it looks easier than I thought.

153
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,600
So you're saying we just throw people around.


154
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Wait a minute!

155
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,850
I can excuse Minamida-san, since she has thirteen years of judo under her belt. But Marilyn...

156
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,690
don't you think you're underrating judo just a bit?

157
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,720
Fujiko-san, listen, she doesn't have thirteen years of judo under her belt,

158
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,140
just thirteen guys who rejected her.

159
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,700
Zip it, will you?

160
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,200
What?

161
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,480
Experience?

162
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,230
O-Of course I do.

163
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,210
How much?

164
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,990
Hey, how much?

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,720
Th-Thirteen...

166
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,990
Thirteen years?

167
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,750
Nope, thirteen guys.


168
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,840
I totally get why you'd want to take up judo after thirteen guys rejected you.

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,900
I told you to can it, toots!

170
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,760
Anyway, we just throw people around, right?



171
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,180
Someone be my partner.

172
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,110
Okay, I will.

173
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,160
What?

174
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,680
You saw me gorge myself with food, so I have to use judo to start dieting.

175
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,160
S-Sure, why not?

176
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,060
I need to protect myself from gropers anyway,

177
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,530
so a partner your size will be good practice.

178
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,280
Just don't hurt me, okay?

179
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,090
So you take this here...

180
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,550
Then do this...

181
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,210
Fujiko-san.

182
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,580
Yes?


183
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,550
I think we're starting to look like a judo team.

184
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,020
Yeah.

185
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,690
Is this really going to help me diet?

186
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,070
Get off of me. You're heavy!

187
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,880
You can't just start off with a bigger opponent.

188
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,410
You're... heavy!

189
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,160
Let's go, Kyonkyon.
You're... heavy!

190
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,890
Sure.

191
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,890
Get off of me!

192
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,810
I stood up too fast.

193
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,170
Kyonkyon, what's wrong?

194
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,790
I'm fine.

195
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,170
Are you sure?

196
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,730
Hang in there.

197
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,960
Get off of me. You're heavy! Come on!

198
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,800
Now throw me.

199
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,130
Y-You go first, Paddy-field.

200
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,180
Just throw me, will you?

201
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,260
No, I insist that you go first.

202
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,220
Forget about me. Now do it!

203
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,810
Okay, go!

204
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,710
D-Don't mind me.

205
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,100
Come on, one, two...

206
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,170
Three, four.

207
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,020
Two, two...

208
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,090
Three, four.

209
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,860
One, two, three, four...

210
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,050
You're not at a school dance!

211
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,320
You're heavy. I can't breathe!

212
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,010
Get off of me!

213
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,330
Th-This is <i>not</i> judo!

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,590
Fujiko-san was acting pretty weird today.

219
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
So this is youth?

220
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,290
Fujiko.

221
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,880
Oh, Hanazono's at the faucets.

222
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,420
Thank you very much.

223
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,160
Hanazono-san?

224
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,140
Yes?

225
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,350
F-Fujiko-san!

226
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,400
She came again!

227
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,760
How the hell does <i>that</i> guy get a chick?

228
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,860
I-I see.

229
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,180
You recruited five members. Good for you.

230
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,680
But it's not going to work.

231
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,190
That joke of a judo team is not going to attract Inokuma-san.

232
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,240
At first I thought if she saw a team hard at work, she'd come back to judo,

233
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,200
even if the members were weak and clumsy.

234
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,710
But what I have now...

235
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,190
Fujiko-san, you can't give up!



236
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,950
Like I said before, I'll do whatever I can for you.

237
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,140
So... So...

238
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,910
Go for it, Hanazono!

239
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,060
Get her on her back!

240
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,060
U-Um...

241
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,170
F-Forgive me!

242
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,020
It's okay.

243
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,340
Still...

244
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:50,450
a woman's college is completely uncharted territory for me, I'm embarrassed to say.

245
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,490
I'm not sure how much help I can provide.

246
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,410
I've got it!

247
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,370
I know someone who's perfect for the job, Fujiko-san.

248
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,970
And that someone is...

249
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,370

250
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,030
What?

251
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,500
That dingbat is whining again about utter nonsense?

252
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,420
Yes. So I went ahead and...

253
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,510
So that's why she's been slacking on training and taking it easy!

254
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,680
"It's all judo's fault," my Aunt Fanny!

255
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,010
No real judo student gets weepy over that!




256
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,450
Can't she ever give that swelled head of hers a rest?

257
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,020
So that's why I went ahead and...

258
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,850
Thanks for telling me that.

259
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm gonna grab her by the scruff of the neck and beat some character into her!

260
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,880
Th-Things will get out of hand if you do that!

261
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,450
Mind your own darn business!
 That's how I trained her as a kid!

262
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,250
But Yawara isn't a kid anymore!


263
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,000
So what I've been trying to say is that

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,400
I'd do anything to get Yawara into judo again.

265
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,940
So I created a judo team at Mitsuba Women's Junior College.

266
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,310
But, try as I might, my judo team is completely hopeless.


267
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,060
So I came to you, the highly esteemed judo master,


268
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:32,820
because Hanazono-san said you can make something out of a completely hopeless team.

269
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,720
That is correct.

270
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,790
I am the highly esteemed judo master. Nothing is impossible.

271
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,000
Do you really mean it?



272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,690
A judo master never goes back on his word.

273
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,000
So, what's your plan?

274
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,510
Thank you very much!

275
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,020
Yes.

276
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,020
What?

277
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,020
A match.

278
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,030
Excuse me?

279
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,410
Beanpole, that judo team you created...

280
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,930
must fight in a match!

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,880
I wish I'd never have to worry about my diet.

284
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,610
I have to build up stamina for the hard training I'm facing.

285
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,380
Training?

286
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,310
It's nothing! Forget what I said!

287
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,040
Hm?

288
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,280
What? You're busy again?

Y-Yeah.

290
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,280
But I wanted to show you my pictures from Canada.

291

No need to worry. We won't be fighting any matches the way we are now.

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,860
Inokuma-san, come back!

352
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,890
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 516 Days

353
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,540
Fujiko-san, what happened?

354
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,750
I swear, this is the most mixed-up bunch I've ever seen!

355
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,420
They are going to need Jigoro's Deluxe Intensive Training Program.

356
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,510
Intensive training program?

357
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,430
Nothing for you to worry about!

358
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,030
Grandpa!

359
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,280
Next time on Yawara:

360
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,020
The Extreme Training Program.

361
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,870
I'll make you their practice dummy if you don't watch.

362
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,940
The Extreme 
Training Program!
I'll make you their practice dummy if you don't watch.

363
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,880
The Extreme 
Training Program!

364
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:38,770
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

365
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,070
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru

366
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,700
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.
hitonami no kousaten senaka osarenagara

367
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:03,880
We climb an endless hill, just you and me.
sakamichi wo doko made mo anata to aruita

368
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:13,260
I want to say "I love you" to the one I truly want,
naze hoshii mono wo "daisuki" to

369
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:20,520
But why can I not? I really don't know.
koe ni dashite ienai no?

370
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,270
You're standing here by my side.
ima anata ga iru

371
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:36,490
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.
tada sore dake de yasuragu kimochi

372
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,580
"Please don't let go of the hand you're holding,"
"tsunaideru sono yubi wo hanasanaide..."

373
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,960
I say as I look for your smile.
egao wo sagashite
