You're the only one I can count on!

00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,010
You're her steady, Matsuda,

Is he off to see Yawara-san again?

But hasn't she quit judo?

33
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,850
Yeah, but he hopes not.

34
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,930
Gotta feel for Kuni-chan.

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,330
Excuse me.

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,040
I'm going to tell her everything.

I can't see her now.

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,350
Like I care!

40
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,270
I'm going to bring her back to judo!

Where are you going, Kosaku?

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,990
Weren't we supposed to eat some fried food after we rushed our stuff off to print?

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,090
Sorry, can you go alone?



44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,290
How rude!

45
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,760
You're making a lady go by herself? I can't eat it all alone!

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,360
But you always eat enough to feed three, don't you?

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,520
Anyway, I have business, so can you get off?

48

No!

54
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,790
I haven't skied before, and isn't the equipment pricey anyway?

Don't worry!

You can rent clothes and skis,

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,890
I won't give up.

87
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,270
I won't give up, not until Inokuma-san takes up judo again.

88
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,250
Not until I get to see her shine again.

89
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,250

Wh-What's going on here?

98
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,060
Back when Yawara-san was thinking of quitting judo, what did you guys...

99
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,070
These girls will compete in a match in order to bring Yawara back to judo.

100
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,530
We're going to reproduce here what we did with Musashiyama High School's judo team.

101
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,540
You're a swell guy, Hanazono-kun!



102
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,080
You're really something, you know that?

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,320
I-I wasn't the one who came up with the idea.

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,320
This is all because Ito Fujiko-san is such a good friend.

105
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,510
She's a wonderful woman.

106
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,290
However...

107
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,190
Hey, are you all right?

108
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,180
Like I said, it's a little too much for me.

109
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,050
Hey, I know her! It's that hussy on the train!

110
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,100
Get a hold of yourself!

111
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,810
That Matsuda-san from
 <i>All Sports News</i> is unbelievable.

112
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,150
What happened?

113
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,950
What happened? He came to my school uninvited today!

114
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,110
I had to run away and hide!

115
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,870
Oh?


116
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,450
He came on his motorcycle.

117
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,870
And Kuniko-san was on the back, clinging to him.

118
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
You mean Kuniko-san the photographer?

119
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,090
There's something going on between them.

120
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,130
Hasn't he given you a ride before?

121
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,300
Please, don't bring that up.
 It was only because he forced me.

122
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,370
Whatever you say.

123
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,140
Anyway, where's Grandpa?

124
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,120
He left in the evening, saying he was going to be late,

125
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,150
though he's been doing that every night.

126
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,150
Don't you think Grandpa's been acting weird lately?

127
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,160
I guess he is, although everything about him is weird.

128
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,520
You're all quitting?

129
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,340
This is bad for my body. I might even build up muscle tone.

130
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,850
It's really wearing me out.

131
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,890
I might even die.

132
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,810
Wusses.


133
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,060
I get how you're doing this out of desperation because guys keep turning you down,

134
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,820
but I'm not like you.

135
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,330
Who are you calling "desperate"?


136
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,780
By all means, throw people around and work out that frustration.

137
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,030
What did you say?!

138
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,280
Now, now, girls...
What did you say?!

139
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,240
Let them quit.

140
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,210
But, sir...

141
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,540
There's no hope for this bunch anyway.


142
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,540
But I nearly killed myself getting these five together. They're all I have.

143
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,550
Don't quit! I beg you!

144
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,300
Let them be, Hanazono.

145
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,510
B-But, sir...


146
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,560
You girls had a man of my caliber as your coach.

147
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,560
It would've driven the media wild, and you all would've become overnight sports sensations.

148
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,030
It's a darn shame that story will never happen.

151
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,040
Take a look now.



152
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,000
You're here from the top sports paper, <i>All Sports News</i>, to cover them, right?


153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,090
If you caught the eye of a major paper like <i>All Sports News</i>,

154
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,560
that alone would cause a big uproar in the press.

155
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,970
Isn't that right, Matsuda?

156
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,630
Well...

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,600
Come on, Kaga-kun, take those pictures!

175
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,500
Why the frowns?

176
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,070
That's not how we want our future stars to look!

177
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,110
Come on now!

178
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,750
Oh, looking good!

179
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,320
Come on, bigger smiles!

180
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,300
Like this?

181
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,040
That's it, there it is!


182
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,550
Yay!

183
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, excellent!

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,690
All right, morning practice is over!

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,440
Thank you very much.

189
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,580
Now then...

190
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,890
time to take my morning bath.

191
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,120
I thought I'd get yelled at for lack of effort.

192
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,580
She's not supposed to slack off in practice just because she wants to quit judo.

193
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,130
But I'll just walk on by.

Grandpa has been acting really weird lately.


196
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,180
I wonder if it's age-related?

The "Gentle Way" Isn't Built in a Day

198

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,070

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,120
Inokuma-san.

207
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,860
Inokuma-san!

208
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,110
What is it?

209
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,340
What's wrong?

211
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:31,330
Oh, uh, I was wondering if you could cover my shift again?

212
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,120
Sure, of course. You've been pretty busy lately.

213
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,130
Let me guess. You have a boyfriend?

214
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,130
A boyfriend?

215
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,630
Fujiko-san!


216
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,390
Oh, God no! Please!

217
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,910
Huh, where did you get those scrapes?

218
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,670
It's nothing. I tripped and fell.

219
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,220
Are you okay, Fujiko-san?

220
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,270
I'm fine! Nothing to worry about!

221
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,150

I'm fine! Nothing to worry about!

222
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,650
Have they accepted?

223
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,360
Yes, they have.

224
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,860
Who?

225
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,820
Once I told them that Inokuma Yawara goes to Mitsuba College, they went for it immediately.

226
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,910
In a month, you're in a match with the Tsukushi University's women's judo team.

227
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,540
What?



228
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,760
That's the top women's team in the country!

229
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,670
Fine by me!

Your footwork's not good enough!

232
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,060
Keep that up, and they'll use it against you!

233
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,630
Don't slack off just because it's a practice match, you hear me?!

234
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,030
This is Inokuma Yawara's Mitsuba College we're talking about!



235
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,120
Coach, I haven't seen Yamada Kaori this fired up in ages!

236
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,750
It's not just Yamada. They all have the fire.

237
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,940
They're going against Mitsuba Women's College, the school that produced <i>the</i> Inokuma Yawara.


238
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,800
There's no telling how formidable her other teammates are.



239
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,820
We're the number one team in the country.

240
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,220
We can't lose to a newly minted squad.

241
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,720
Don't be so sure!

242
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,560
All we know is that it's Inokuma Yawara's team,

243
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,410
and their coach is none other than Master Inokuma Jigoro!



244
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,230
Those two prodigies have joined forces!

245
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,740
Yamada-senpai, is Mitsuba College really that tough?

246
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,500
I don't know.

247
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,240
But I do know one thing!

248
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,270
Inokuma Yawara is unbelievably tough.

249
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,940
What are you doing? Break her hold, like I just taught you!

250
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,010
At this rate, your dreams of stardom will stay dreams!

251
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,980
Get off of me. You're heavy!



252
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,980
And you, Fatty, don't just lie there, tighten up your hold!

253
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,040
One, two, three, four...

254
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,610
When are you two gonna stop folk dancing?

255
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,990
Look, now is a good time to do an Ouchi Gari.

256
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,240
Okay.




257
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,990
Not good enough!

258
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,260
Are you sure they'll be ready?

259
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,460
Nothing is impossible.

260
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,050
I hope we get done with the exams soon, Fujiko-san.

261
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,760
Fujiko-san! Fujiko-san!

262
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,680
You look tired.

263
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,520
Huh?

264
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,050
Oh, I'm fine. Really.

265
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,970
Fresh as a daisy.

266
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,530
Here.

267
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,850
Hey, Fujiko-san, did you see the bulletin board?

268
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,340
They're doing a ski tour after the exams!

269
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,300
Skiing? When?


270
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,880
I think it was three days after the finals.

271
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,270
It'll be my first time skiing. I want to go so bad.

272
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,310
No! Y-You can't!

273
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,270
You there, be quiet!

274
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,320
Sorry.
Sorry.


275
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,270
You can't go! You have to keep your schedule open that day!

276
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,780
Why's that?

277
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,950
Why?

278
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,070
Well, that's an unlucky day for skiing.

279
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,190
What do you mean?

280
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,170
Well, you see...

281
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,340
Ah, shoot! I have to get going!

282
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,210
Fujiko-san, those scrapes are getting worse.

283
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,460
At my age, I get injured easily.

284
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,750
Eh?
At my age, I get injured easily.

285
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:00,890
S-See you!
Eh?

286
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,360
S-See you!

287
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,070
Sorry!

288
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,570
She's really acting weird.

289
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,570
How can I get you to understand, Glamorish Girl?!


290
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,880
I told you <i>not</i> to be so quick to end up on your back!

291
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,300
Get off of me. You're heavy!

292
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,720
Let's keep going, Fujiko-san.

293
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,590
Get off of me!

294
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,090
Make a half-circle at the pivot leg...

295
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,340
I said, get off of me!

296
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,100
I can't deal with this!

297
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,730
Oh my!

298
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,730
Un... deux... trois!

299
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,620
That was an excellent Ouchi Gari. Ippon!


300
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,740
Nice going, Fujiko-san!

301
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,580
You were wonderful.

302
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,580
What? No kidding? You're serious?

303
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,010
I always knew you could do it, Fujiko-san!

304
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,380
Very good!

305
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,920
Yippee!

306
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,780
Teach me more, Hanazono-san!

307
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,390
Please train me harder!

308
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,510
Fujiko-san.

309
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,970
Hanazono-san.

310
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,830
Oh my, your nose...

311
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,470
It's nothing to worry about.

312
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,360
All right, I can do it too!

313
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,290
Marilyn, you're with me!

314
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,010
But I'm exhausted!

315
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,180
Quit your bellyaching, and do what you're told!

316
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,620
Still...

317
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,620
That beanpole does have the right stuff.

318
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,100
I guess this neophyte, patchwork judo team is starting to come together.

319
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,560
I'll have to arrange a meeting so I can show this to Yawara.

320
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,630
...deux, trois!

321
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,920
I owe you one, Inokuma-san.



322
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,840
I'll give this back once I've made a copy.

323
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,650
Okay.

324
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,950
I really have to go, so I'll see you.

325
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,150
Fujiko-san! Wait!

326
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,150
Gotta run! Gotta run!

327
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,240
She's acting bizarre.

328
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,700
Too bizarre!

329
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,270
Why did she enter the gym?

330
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,310
Come on! Hey!

331
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,320
You're not pulling hard enough on the left!

332
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,840
And use that foot of yours, dang it!

333
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,510
Use... my foot.

334
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,970
Ippon! Ippon!

335
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,430
Very good!

336
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,380
So, old man, do I get to wear a black belt?

337
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,600
Black, pink, whatever!

338
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,330
What are you doing?

339
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,600
Inokuma!

340
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,050
Inokuma-san!

341
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,260
What are you doing here, Grandpa?

342
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,020
And you, Fujiko-san, and Hanazono-kun?

343
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,610
Just what it looks like, judo.

344
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,570
They'll be in a match soon, and I'm here to give them some direction.

345
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,570
A match?

346
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,030
Who are we competing against?


347
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,370
Oh, right. We're playing the Tsukushi University Women's Judo Team.

348
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,080
It'll be next Sunday at their dojo.

349
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,040
Tsukushi University? Next Sunday?

350
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,970
Now hold on. They've only begun playing this sport.

351
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,160
So why are you putting them in danger?

352
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,830
W-We were...


353
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,180
Mind your own beeswax!

354
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,180
Since you're not part of this team, you have no right to complain.

355
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,140
Grandpa...

356
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,440
I'm glad she came. Now our strength has increased a hundredfold!



357
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,020
The win's as good as ours!

358
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,080
No!

359
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,370
Inokuma-san won't be lending us a hand.

360
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,910
We'll win this by ourselves.

361
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,240
What?

362
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,630
You can go skiing or whatever, Inokuma-san!

363
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,870
And there you have it.

364
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,630
Fujiko-san...

365
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,890
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 509 Days.


366
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,500
What are you trying to do, Grandpa?

367
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,840
There's no way they can compete in a match after only a month of training!

368
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,940
I already said because you're not a team member, you can't complain!

369
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,660
My book doesn't contain the world "impossible"!

370
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,720
What if someone gets hurt?

371
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,170
Next time on Yawara:

372
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,690
The Dangerous Debut Match.

373
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,830
Yawara, the ski slopes are calling you!

374
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,170
The Dangerous Debut Match
Yawara, the ski slopes are calling you!

375
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,830
The Dangerous Debut Match

376
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:38,640
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

377
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,940
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru

378
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,530
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.
hitonami no kousaten senaka osarenagara

379
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:03,710
We climb an endless hill, just you and me.
sakamichi wo doko made mo anata to aruita

380
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,140
I want to say "I love you" to the one I truly want,
naze hoshii mono wo "daisuki" to

381
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:20,430
But why can I not? I really don't know.
koe ni dashite ienai no?

382
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,150
You're standing here by my side.
ima anata ga iru

383
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:36,370
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.
tada sore dake de yasuragu kimochi

384
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:43,460
"Please don't let go of the hand you're holding,"
"tsunaideru sono yubi wo hanasanaide..."

385
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,840
I say as I look for your smile.
egao wo sagashite
