I know it's what I want the most.

All right!

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,730
Too cool!
All right!

23
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,120
Too cool!

24
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,880
You did it, Fujiko-san!

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,720
This is truly incredible!

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,910
MWJC advances to the second round without the aid of Inokuma!

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,760
So that girl is the huge obstacle Kojiro-san was talking about.

28
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,820
Swan vs. Tanks

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,180

We didn't get to see Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi.

33
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,270
Oh well, let's just hope we see it in the second round.

34
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll go buy some juice.

35
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,980
So what do you think, Saito-san, about the solid performance of MWJC's vice captain, Ito Fujiko?

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,250
Quite marvelous. She definitely has her rhythm down.

37
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,330
Also, the way she used her height to launch that Ouchi Gari from so far away was brilliant.

38
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,220
You might also say it's that Inokuma magic at work.

39
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,320
You big lunk!
That was amazing, Fujiko-san!

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,650

44
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,750
I also felt a huge rush when I saw Inokuma take the gold medal at the World Cup.

45
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,310
I have to say, that's Inokuma for you.

46
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,700
That's Saito-san, who blushes whenever Inokuma is mentioned.

47
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
A-Again?

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,710
Don't be silly!

49
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,420
Looks like we won't be needing you.

50
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,710
Fujiko-san!

51
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,670
You did great, Fujiko-san!

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,930
Hanazono-san!

53
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,450
You can do it!

54
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,460
Keep up that pace, and you'll win it all!

55
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:26,470
O-Oh, come on!
Keep up that pace, and you'll win it all!

There are so many strong players. You know I can't...

58
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,650
I, Hanazono Kaoru, am here for you! You'll be fine!

59
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,610
Hanazono-san...

60
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,690
Hey, how was my Deashi Barai?

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,220
It was totally awesome!

62
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,960
But Fujiko-san's Ouchi Gari was out of sight!

63
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,760
Hey, Fujiko—

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,710
Come on, leave her alone!

65
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,590
What?

66
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,880
First Round, Match Five, Court B:

00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,950
Ferras Women's College vs. Kuroyuri Women's Sports College.

68
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,110
Move it.

69
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,080
To... Todo-san?!

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,090
Who are you calling a "sea lion"?

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,510
Yes, it has.

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,340
It <i>has</i> been a while since I last fought you!

76
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,300
See you in the second round.

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,850
We're facing Todo-san's team in the second round?

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,320
Looks like it.

79
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,280
I <i>will</i> atone for the honor I lost two years ago!



80
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,170
She's strong, very strong indeed!

81
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,670
Though the other Seishin Women's competitors are mere ciphers,

82
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,360
Honami continues to win with frightening fury!

83
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,230
Uchi Mata. Ippon!

84
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,810
She advances to the semis!

85
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,600
Now if MWJC also advances, we'll finally have the long-awaited rematch between the fated rivals!

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,310
The rematch between Inokuma and Honami!

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,830
A rematch between fated rivals?

88
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,190
But before you fight Yawara...

89
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,620
you have a big job ahead of you, Miss Sayaka.

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,640
We will now hold the second match of the second round,

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,870
between Mitsuba Women's Junior College and Kuroyuri Women's Sports College.

B-But look at who we're up against!

99
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,310
Last year, Kuroyuri College was the runner-up in this tournament.

100
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,080
And this year, they definitely don't lack intensity!

101
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,990
Todo-san looks scary!

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,110
You're right.

103
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,610
The whole thing'll be over if you don't move it.

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,070
Okay!

106
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,700
Her opponents this time around won't be nearly as easy to beat.

107
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,360

108
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,210

109
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,250
Yeah, yeah. Bring it on.

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,710
Oh!

111
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,720
You make all sorts of noises, don't you?

112
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Oh, no! Once she pulls you in, she'll do a Deashi Barai!

113
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,970
Ippon! Done!

114
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,770
They <i>are</i> strong!

115
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,810
Ow...



116
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,220
She threw you down in the blink of an eye. Lame!

117
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,010
Not like you're gonna win anyway!

118
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,430
I'll just go and take that spotlight.

119
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,900
Are you okay?

120
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,250
Ow... She didn't have to throw me so hard!

121
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,140
Hajime!

122

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,610
Oh God, it's like beet red!

123
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,480
I didn't even get a chance to hog the spotlight!

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,490
You lost already?

125
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,670

130
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,150
Hajime!

131
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,890
Don't let her grab you so fast, Yoshinagawa-san!

132
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,780
Get out of there, Yoshinagawa-san!

Let's see, one, two, three... Cabbie, can you make small change?

145

I forgot the receipt!

150
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,560
MWJC is in real trouble.

151
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,960
Kuroyuri's first player, Fujiwara, has beaten MWJC's first three.

152
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,990
And now she's facing their vice captain, Ito Fujiko!

Get her for the three of us!

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,820
Fujiwara, don't go easy on her!

157
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,260
Kick her butt!

158
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,120
Sorry. I-I'm sorry. If you please...

159
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,280
Excuse us. Sorry.

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,150

Fujiko!

00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,990
She's actually playing judo!

164
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,590
Dear, stop her now!

165
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,170
She's too delicate to participate in such a violent sport!

166
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,630
Stop her? Are you...

167
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,130
I shouldn't have let her go to Tokyo!




168
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,590
I didn't make her practice ballet for over ten years just to see her in judo!

169
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,110
Fujiko-san! Don't stand upright!

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,960
I can't. She's too strong!

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,650
I don't even have time to say "un, deux, trois"!

173
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,540
It'll be fine, you can do it!

174
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,110
Un, deux, trois.

175
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,160
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.

176
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,660
Un!

177
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,160
...deux, trois!

178
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,830
Un, deux, trois!

179
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,700
Un... deux...

180
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,580
Un... deux...

181
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,370
Now!

182
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,080
trois!

183
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,180
Ippon!

184
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,350
Done!

185
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,350
She did it! Ito did it again with her Ouchi Gari!

186
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,060
Huh, what's going on?

187
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,230
It looks like she won.

188
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,210
Eh?

189
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,780
Fujiko won!

190
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,650
You're kidding me!

191
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,880
I mean it!

195
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,190
Keep it up! Keep it up!

196
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,790
Pound them into the pavement!

197
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,460
Come on, you know I can't!

198
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,010
Forward!

199
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,460
That was just dumb luck! Put her down, Ikarashi!

200
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,930
She's just tall, is all!

201
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,980
Wh-Why can't she be normal?

202
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,220
Hang in there, Fujiko-san!

203
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,020
Who on earth made her do this?

204
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,550
Hajime!

205
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,700
Get her, Fujiko-san! She's just heavy!

206
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,520
Just do what I taught you personally, and you'll win!

207
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,210
Remember, un, deux, trois!

208
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:13,740
Un, deux, trois...

209
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,710
You taught her <i>personally</i> ?
Un, deux, trois...

210
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,210
So you're the one?!

211
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,710
You're the one who dragged my daughter into judo?!

212
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,720
Wh-What do you mean?

213
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois...

214
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,950
What will you do if she injures that nubile body before marriage?

215
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,600
How dare you?! How dare you?!

216
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Trois!

217
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,570
Ippon!

218
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:41,900
She did it.

219
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,320
She's awesome!
She did it.

220
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,860
Looking good!

221
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,910
Good. Very good.

222
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,870
Father? Mother?

223
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,370
M-My name is Hanazono Kaoru from Ebiten Sports College!

224
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,880
Who cares about that?

225
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,980
Are you going to take responsibility?

226
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,890
Responsibility? But I haven't done anything to her.

227
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,590
We have no idea where this match is headed now!

228
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,930
Thanks to a strong showing by MWJC's vice captain, Ito Fujiko,

229
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,850
Kuroyuri is now sending out their third player!

230
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,290
Watch out for her Ouchi Gari, you hear?!

231
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,900
Take her out, Miyoko!

232
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,900
Leave her to me, Sis.

233
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,580
The fearsome Ohtawara twins are the great hopes for the heavyweight division

234
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,910
in the Barcelona Olympics. Here's the younger of the two, the third player, Ohtawara Miyoko!

235
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,370
Sh-She looks like a monster!

236
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,390
Hajime!



237
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,700
This time, the younger Ohtawara is watching out for that Ouchi Gari by lowering her stance!

238
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,550
Sh-She's very strong!

239
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,560
Now pin her down!

240
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,360
Fujiko!

241
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,720
Wow, now that's flexibility!

242
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,710
She evades the younger Ohtawara's Osaekomi with a body bridge!

243
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,240
Jougai! Mate!

244
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,320
She's incredibly flexible, Saito-san!

245
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,910
I call that a treasure!

246
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,870
A flexible body is the most valuable treasure a judo player can have.

247
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,100
Fujiko! I didn't let you practice ballet so you could do that!





248
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,400
So how will you make this right?

249
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,380
Look! We aren't in that type of relationship.

250
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,180
Why, you...

251
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,430
Quit twisting and turning all over the place!

252
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,680
Un... deux... trois!

253
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,140
Un... deux... trois!

254
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,690
Un... deux... trois!

255
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,650
Ippon! Ito got her with another Ouchi Gari!

256
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,120
This is more than I expected.

257
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,660
That obstacle is stronger and thicker than I imagined.

258
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,040
It's now a standoff between the two vice captains!

259
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,540
Here comes Ohtawara the elder.

260
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,500
Sh-She looks just the same!

261
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,750
Wait, if she keeps on winning, we won't see Inokuma Yawara again!

262
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,380
Come on, get out there, Yawara-chan!

263
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,510
That's right!

264
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,470
Right behind Ito, the team captain, Inokuma Yawara, is waiting in the wings!

265
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,640
Kuroyuri College really needs to defeat Ito right here!

266
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,350
Hajime!

267
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,350
Take a fall, Beanpole!

268
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,860
That's enough!

269
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,350
Send out Inokuma!

270
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,160
Why are you telling my daughter to lose?!

271
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,860
Her name's not "Beanpole," it's Fujiko!

272
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,180
Un... deux...

273
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,780
Un... deux...

274
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,280
Watch out!

275
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,280
It's Ohtawara with a Tomoe Nage!

276
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,280
And Ito holds on!

277
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,740
Jougai! Mate!





278
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,600
She fended off Ito's Ouchi Gari and gave her a Tomoe Nage, Saito-san!

279
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,670
Indeed, Ohtawara really needs to get her in a grappling hold!

280
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,980
Inokuma-san...

281
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,630
I can't go on!

282
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,130
Don't worry. She'll try another Tomoe Nage!

283
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,680
When she does, give her your un, deux, trois!

284
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,470
Hajime!

285
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,100
I don't quite get it!

286
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,080
Get her!

287
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,560
One more time, Sis!

288
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,030
Un, deux...

289
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,460
Trois!

290
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,330
Ippon!

291
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,670
See, you did it!

292
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,330
That was <i>so</i> cool!

293
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,300
I don't know how, but I just won again!

294
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,730
Wow!



295
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm pleased!

296
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,300
MWJC's vice captain, Ito Fujiko, is pulverizing her opponents!

297
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,310
She now faces the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships

298
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,310
72 kg heavyweight titleholder, Tohdoh Yuki!

299
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,230
To... Todo-san's scary!

300
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,490
Wh-What should I do?

301
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,240
Don't think about it. Just win it for us!

302
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,240
I can't! It's literally impossible!

303
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,740
Relax, you still have your un, deux, trois!

304
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,240
And even if you lose, we still have Yawara-chan!

305
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,080
Right, Yawara-chan?

306
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,620
You can win!

307
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,720
I know you can win, Fujiko-san!

308
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,130
Right now, you can beat anyone with your Ouchi Gari!

309
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,900
But I can't!

310
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,090
Come forward!

311
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,540
Bow!

312
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,720
You can just take a hike, for all I care.

313
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,940
The only opponent I want to face...

314
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,920
is Inokuma Yawara!

315
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,950
I-Is Fujiko going up against that behemoth?!

316
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm putting a stop to this.

317
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,960
I am definitely putting a stop to this!

318
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,950
Ah, Mother!

319
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,980
I don't recall... allowing you to even call me "Mother."

320
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,850
You know you can't put a stop to this!

321
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,140
What are you doing to my wife?
You know you can't put a stop to this!

322
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,870
Hajime!

323
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,170
Stop this, Fujiko!

324
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,650
Oh, my God! Todo-san is so heavy and strong!

325
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,140
Come on, quit wriggling around!

326
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,600
Ah! Now, Fujiko-san!

327
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,140
Un... deux... trois!

328
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,650
Un... deux... trois!

329
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,850
Un... deux... trois!

330
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,480
She did it!

331
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,780
Ito Fujiko has beaten all five!

332
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,100
All right!
All right, Fujiko!
Ito Fujiko has beaten all five!

333
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,740
All right, Fujiko!
All right!

334
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,760
Oh, wait! It's a Jougai!

335
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,750
Her feet were already out of bounds while doing that move!

336
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,060
That can't be!

337
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,250
Fujiko just won, right, dear?

338
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,260
This is no time to be excited!

339
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,800
Right you are.

340
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,860
I'm stopping this!

341
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,040
Wait, dear!

342
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,440
That was a fearsome Ouchi Gari.

343
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,320
But don't think you can last long in judo as a...

344
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,480
one-trick pony!

345
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,990
Tohdoh goes for a Kouchi Gari. Look out, Ito Fujiko!

346
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,990
Ito hangs on by standing on tiptoes with one foot! What great balance!

347
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,870
Un... deux... trois!

348
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,700
Un... deux... trois!

349
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,420
Un... deux... trois!

350
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,760
Yuko!

351
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,580
It's a Yuko! After balancing herself on tiptoes to avoid Tohdoh's Kouchi Gari,

352
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,260
Ito comes back with her Ouchi Gari!

353
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,630
Oh, no! Get out of there now!

354
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,140
Oh! Tohdoh immediately goes for a grappling hold after taking a Yuko!

355
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,450
Get around it!

356
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,140
Get out of there, Fujiko-san!

357
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,500
Get her, Tohdoh-senpai!

358
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,230
Pin her down, and we'll win!

359
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,360
Osaekomi!

360
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,590
Tohdoh has her in a tight Yoko Shiho Gatame!

361
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,410
Ito Fujiko is unable to move an inch!

362
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,250
What? What on earth is she doing to you, Fujiko?!






363
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,350
You! Stop that!

364
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,750
Please, get up!

365
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,800
Ten seconds in!

366
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,800
Don't give up, Fujiko-san! Move!

367
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,680
I reckon I'll have to teach her about grappling holds next time.

368
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,390
Twist your hips around! Raise your upper body!

369
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,350
I'll finally get to fight you, Inokuma Yawara!

370
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,820
Get up, Fujiko!

371
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,780
Don't lose, Fujiko!

372
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,200
Ippon!

373
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,990
Ito Fujiko is finally defeated!

374
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,450
Tohdoh Yuki showed us why she's the heavyweight titleholder!



375
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,750
She's not letting a white belt have five straight wins!

376
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,030
But you gotta hand it to Ito for getting this far!

377
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,370
She performed a real feat by beating four of Kuroyuri's tank squadron.

378
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,180
The auditorium is applauding for her as well!

379
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,530
You did great, Fujiko!

380
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,350
Though I'm not sure how.

381
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,730
Honey!

382
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,500
Sh-She's a magnificent woman!

383
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,650
Fujiko-san is truly fantastic!

384
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,550
That's because she's our daughter.

385
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,470
Yes. That was our own daughter!

386
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,070
Mother... Father.

387
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,060
In any case, I don't remember letting you off the hook!

388
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,000
I swear, it's not like that between us!

389
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,080
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,640
What are you saying? You beat four of them!

391
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,110
You were totally awesome, Fujiko-san!

392
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,150
But...

393
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,000
Forget it, I'm done!

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,810
Fujiko-san!

395
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,500
Yawara-chan, take her out!




396
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,820
Fujiko-san fought hard out there, you know!

397
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,480
I'm not worried!

398
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,030
Todo-san is no match for Inokuma-san!

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,310
She's finally here! MWJC's team captain, Inokuma Yawara!

400
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,770
This is her first official match since the World Cup!

401
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,470
The excitement from that day is coming alive once again!

402
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,560
Here she is.

403
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,470
Inokuma.

404
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,430
Inokuma Yawara.

405
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,400
Yawara.

406
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,020
You really went out with a bang, Beanpole.

407
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,540
But you'll always be the main attraction, Yawara.

408
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,490
This won't be like the last time.

409
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,450
I've studied your Ippon Zeoi thoroughly.

410
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,320
Hajime!

411
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,930
The Barcelona Olympics in 439 Days

412
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,690
Fujiko-san was <i>so</i> close!
 She almost had five straight wins!

413
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,230
All right, Yawara. You're up!

414
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,740
But isn't it amazing how she beat four of them, Grandpa?

415
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,320
Yawara! You'd better get that Ippon in five — no, one second!

416
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Yawara!

417
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,830
You Can Do It, Kyonkyon!

418
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,870
You'll be getting my Ouchi Gari if you don't watch!

419
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,430
<b>You Can Do It, Kyonkyon<i>!
You'll be getting my Ouchi Gari if you don't watch!</b></i>

420
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,880
<b>You Can Do It, Kyonkyon<i>!</b></i>

421
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,810
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

422
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:47,150
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru

423
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,660
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.
hitonami no kousaten senaka osarenagara

424
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:03,920
We climb an endless hill, just you and me.
sakamichi wo doko made mo anata to aruita

425
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:13,340
I want to say "I love you" to the one I truly want,
naze hoshii mono wo "daisuki" to

426
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,520
But why can I not? I really don't know.
koe ni dashite ienai no?

427
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,270
You're standing here by my side.
ima anata ga iru

428
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:36,490
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.
tada sore dake de yasuragu kimochi

429
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,670
"Please don't let go of the hand you're holding,"
"tsunaideru sono yubi wo hanasanaide..."

430
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:51,050
I say as I look for your smile.
