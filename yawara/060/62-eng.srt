1
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,530
A match?

2
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,750
Now hold on. They've only begun playing this sport.

3
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,890
So why are you putting them in danger?

4
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,120
W-We were...

5
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,250
Mind your own beeswax!

6
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,750
Since you're not part of this team, you have no right to complain.

7
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm glad she came. Now our strength has increased a hundredfold!

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,450
The win's as good as ours!

9
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,680
Oh no!

10
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,010
Inokuma-san won't be lending us a hand.

11
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,480
We'll... We'll win this by ourselves.

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,110
Fujiko-san...

13
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:18,740
A Dangerous Debut Match!




14
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,450
What?!

15
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,870
You told Yawara-san not to come to the match?

16
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,010
Yes, I did indeed.

17
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,370
I told her it's none of her business.

18
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,880
B-But...

19
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,900
What if she really doesn't come?

20
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,890
You've been following her around for a while, but you still don't understand her, do you?

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,480
She has a contrary nature, so if we told her to come, she'd be even less willing to attend.

22
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,730
Un, deux, trois!

23
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,000
Hanazono-san!

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,540
Fujiko-san, that's the timing!

25
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,160
Good! Very good!

26
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,990
W-Wow...

27
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,780
When did she get so...

28
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,250
It's all thanks to my teachings,
 but she also deserves some praise.

29
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,160
Her ballet experience is helping a lot.



30
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,520
She has springy legs and hips, flexibility, and that height to boot.

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,160
If she'd come to me earlier, she'd be quite a judoist by now.

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,320
I may be able to have a good match even without Yawara.

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,820
Th-Then why are we having the match in the first place?

34
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,150
Haruki, you jerk!
Th-Then why are we having the match in the first place?

35
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,930
Wh-What did she just say?

36
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,110
It's her technique execution shout.

37
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,160
I also have Taka'aki, you jerk;
 Makoto, you jerk; Keisuke, you jerk...

38
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Thirteen in all.

39
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,350
What the heck?

40
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,160
Sex!

41
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,670
Diet!

42
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,840
Sex!

43
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,170
Diet!

44
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,670
Hiroshi, you jerk!

45
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,800
Sex!

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,740
Diet!
Sex!

47
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,800
Shinji, you jerk!
Diet!

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Shinji, you jerk!

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,370
Sex!

50
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,180
Diet!

51
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,940
Takeshi, you jerk!

52
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,960
Sex!

53
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,100
Diet!
Sex!

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,390
Fujiko-san's good, but the other four are hopeless.

55
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,160
In any case, Yawara-san, there's no point if you don't come.

56
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,220
You have to come.

57
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,870
Tamao-san, another serving, please.

58
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,960
Okay.

59
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,650
Father, you've been looking well lately.

60
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:03,880
Yes, unlike your lazy daughter, the girls at the university practice energetically.


61
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,900
It seems to be rubbing off on me.

62
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,200
Oh, I just can't wait for Sunday.

63
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,430
They can't have a match!

64
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,980
Especially not against Tsukushi University.

65
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,640
Sure, they may be working hard, but it's their first time at judo!

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,180
You have no right to say anything when you're not even part of our team!

67
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,610
Besides, not even I can stop the tsunami-like flow of history.

68
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,180
Even if...




69
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,470
the girls are torn to shreds, crushed to smithereens,

70
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,690
or bled dry on the stadium floor...

71
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,280
Grandpa...

72
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,900
...it's their wish to die on the tatami mats, pursuing the path of judo.

73
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,480
Goodness, you're so crazy!



74
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,740
Not my problem!

75
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Sign: Tsukushi University Judo Team

76
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,210
What the...?

77
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,370
I don't see Inokuma Yawara.

78
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,690
Is she really coming, <i>All Sports</i> ?

79
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,310
We came here because we heard

80
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,240
that Inokuma was competing in her first match in Japan since the World Cup.

81
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,380
That's right. You're gonna pay if you were making it all up.

82
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,800
She'll come. She'll definitely come.

83
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,890
Oh, my God, look at them!

84
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,000
That's a lot of reporters!

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,350
I need to spruce myself up.

86
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,670
They're all here to see the princesses of the judo world!

87
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,980
We just really might become celebrities!

88
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,360
Right, Fujiko-san?

89
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,710
Please, Inokuma-san.

90
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,240
Please come quickly.

91
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,330
I'm scared out of my mind!

92
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,380
I mean, if we play a match against people like them...

93
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,970
...w-we'll be killed.

94
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,420
I would like to begin the scrimmage match

95
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,880
between Mitsuba Women's Junior College and Tsukushi University.

96
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,880
We'll play an elimination-style match.

97
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,880
Hello.

98
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,240
Nice to meet you.

99
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,170
Hey, it's about to start!

100
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,680
Where's Inokuma?

101
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,440
What's the big deal, <i>All Sports</i> ?

102
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,020
She's coming! She's definitely coming!

103
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,530
They'll switch her in the moment she gets here.

104
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,330
We'll... We'll win this by ourselves.

105
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,050
Inokuma's not coming.

106
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,630
Just calm down and sit.

107
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,550
B-But...

108
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,070
My stupid little girl falls for this sort of trick constantly.

109
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:35,110
But Master Jigoro, this team won't last long against Tsukushi University.

110
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,190
We really need her to be here right now.

111
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,530
Suck on this, and cool your head.

112
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,590
It looks like Inokuma Yawara still isn't here.

113
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,910
This is nerve-wracking.

114
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,070
Girls, don't look down on them.

115
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,500
Inokuma Yawara may not be here, but they're still MWJC.

116
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,070
Look at them!



117
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,800
They're all so relaxed.

118
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,310
And look at Inokuma Jigoro, 7-dan.

119
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,510
He's confident that he won't need Inokuma Yawara.

120
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,850
However...

121
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,730
However...


122
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,240
Don't worry. Be confident!

123
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,290
You are undoubtedly Japan's strongest judo team.

124
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,700
O-Okay.

125
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,370
Please look over here!

126
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,370
Smile, please!

127
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,070
H-Hey, hold on, guys!

128
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,340
Stop smiling at the reporters.

129
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,080
Fujiko-san, you get in the picture too.

130
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,720
Listen, everyone, please.

131
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Okay.

132
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,170
Inokuma-san's not here yet,
 but the match will start soon.

133
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,390
Is she really coming?

134
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,060
Y-Yes.

135
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,450
So we can't lose before she gets here.

136
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,860
You <i>have to hold out, okay?</i>

137
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,870
Just leave it to us.

138
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,610
We'll just win!

139
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,210
Yeah, we practiced so hard.

140
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,870
We won't win!

141
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,870
They're national champions! Champions!

142
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,270
Anyway, we need to prolong each match.


143
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,870
Even if it's just two minutes extra. Okay? Please.

144
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,880
Okay!

145
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,880
First up, please step forward.

146
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,930
Am I first? I am, right?

147
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,950
I don't know.

148
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,600
Hurry up! Yes, you are.

149
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,390
Okay!

150
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,630
Ogaki, don't drop your guard!

151
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,310
Let's stay focused!

152
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,520
Bow!

153
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,890
Wh-What's she smiling about?

154
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,500
Look at this! It's already begun!

155
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,410
We're here to watch Inokuma, <i>All Sports</i> !

156
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,410
Y-Yawara-san...

157
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,160
Begin!

158
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,880
Ogaki, be careful! Be ready for anything.

159
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,040
Go! Go! Paddy-field!

160
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,840
Fight it! Don't lose just like that!

161
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,880
Please get here fast.

162
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,390
This is definitely not going to last long, Yawara-san!

163
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,540
Takeshi, you jerk!

I-Ippon!

168
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,040
Yay, I won!

169
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,260
That felt good.

170
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,830
That felt really good.

171
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,700
You're awesome, Nanda!

172
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,340
Good going! Your "send all your exes to hell" tactic is working! 

173
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,840
No way.

174
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,230
MWJC isn't too bad.

175
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,430
True, their Ogaki won the high school championships.

176
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,350
This might be a pretty good match even without Inokuma.

177
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,770
What are you saying?

178
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,860
A scrimmage match won't even be worth an article without Inokuma.

179
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,600
There are so many reporters.

180
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,870
I can't go in like this.

181
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,280
I have to say, though, that was a good Deashi Harai.

182
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,380
Maybe Grandpa really is a good coach.

183
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,880
Master, she really did it!

184
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,880
What a surprise!






185
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,340
I was not expecting to see that, Jigoro-san.

186
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,890
That was an amazing Deashi Harai.

187
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,530
It's not surprising.

188
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,670
My coaching is just superb.

189
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,110
But of course, if anyone practices one technique for a month, they'd excel at it.

190
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,490
Th-Then that Paddy-field girl only knows Deashi Harai?

191
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,400
Yeah.

192
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,110
She doesn't know anything else.

193
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,080
What?

194
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,330
Wh-What was that about?!

195
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,540
I told you to be careful, but you can't win if you're so damn nervous!

196
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,870
In any case, now we know we're not up against a bunch of fools.

197
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,160
Hey, Kurokawa! Relax!

198
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,010
You're a national champ!

199
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,020
Okay.




200
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,180
Bring it!

201
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,270
I'll throw you down again!

202
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,840
Oh, Paddy-field!

203
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,150
Don't hog the spotlight all to yourself!

204
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,490
I'm going to become a celebrity, not you!

205
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,440
I don't care how, but prolong the match, Paddy-field!

206
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,420
I don't know if I can.

207
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,900
Maybe I might just win again.

208
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,590
After all, I'm pretty awesome.

209
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,660
Step forward!

210
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,870
Y-Yes.

211
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,630
Bow!

212
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,070
Begin!

213
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,630
Come on, come on.

214
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,540
Here I go.

215
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,480
Don't mess with a girl after a break-up.

216
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,140
Yuji, you jerk!

217
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,270
Y-Yuko!

218
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,150
Didn't I tell you to be careful?!

219
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,400
Kurokawa!

220
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,780
Don't worry! It's not over!

221
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,550
You're hogging the spotlight! 

222
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,280
Good going. 

223
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,240
Yay, I won again!

224
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,840
Not yet.

225
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,790
That was just yuko, understand?

226
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,770
What do you mean?

227
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,420
She fell.

228
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,950
She fell, but it wasn't ippon.

229
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,930
Just yuko.

230
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,450
I threw her, and she fell.

231
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,970
Doesn't that mean I won?

232
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,910
It's obvious that I won.

233
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,260
Isn't it?

234
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,970
The points go from ippon, waza-ari, yuko, to koka,

235
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,270
and it looks like you can't win with just yuko.

236
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,770
Shido!

237
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,770
E-Excuse me?

238
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,630
What is this supposed to mean?

239
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,890
I'm in college!

240
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,280
I don't need you telling me about my conduct!

241
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,750
Shido occurs when you talk back to the judge.

242
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,880
A second one becomes chui, giving the opponent yuko.

243
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,900
Oh, no!

244
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,250
Just listen to the judge, Paddy-field!




245
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,890
But, but, I won just now!

246
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,680
Begin!

247
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,650
Fine...

248
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm super mad now!

249
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,360
Masakazu, you jerk!

250
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,570
Huh?

251
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,590
Damn it.

252
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,890
Kazuya, you jerk!

253
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,700
Damn.

254
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,010
Shinji, you jerk!

255
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,580
Makoto, you jerk!

256
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,210
Keisuke, you jerk!

257
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,390
Tsuyoshi, you jerk!

258
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,830
Hiroshi, you jerk!

259
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,960
Oh, no!

260
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,930
Ouch... 

261
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,140
Ippon!

262
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,080
What was that about?

263
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,460
Tsukushi University is definitely strong.

264
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,070
MWJC's no match.

265
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,650
Where's Inokuma?

266
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,680
A-Are you okay, Nanda-san?

267
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,650
Did you get hurt?

268
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm hurt, and I feel mortified.

269
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,660
MWJC, second person, Yoshinagawa Sayuri-kun!

270
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,440
Wait, what did he say?

271
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,610
Yoshinaga?

272
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,590
Sayuri?

273
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,880
Yoshinaga Sayuri?

274
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,130
Wait, that's Yoshinaga Sayuri?

275
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,430
He said Yoshinagawa, not Yoshinaga.

276
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,260
Kurokawa, be careful!

277
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,490
She's laughing!

278
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,640
Don't lower your guard, Kurokawa! 

279
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,070
Sayuri!


280
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,450
Throw her down, stomp on her, and mess her up!

281
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,490
Go! Go! Sayuri!

282
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,650
Inokuma-san, please come soon.

283
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,970
Hurry up and get here, Yawara-san!

284
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,520
What are you doing?

285
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,610
Begin!

286
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,120
Please don't hurt me.

287
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
Wh-What the...?

288
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,800
She has no balance whatsoever.

289
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,000
It's like she's a beginner.

290
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,810
I should have no trouble throwing her over.

291
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,270
Inokuma-san, please hurry!

292
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,900
Go! Go! Sayuri!

293
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,270
Throw her down, Sayuri!

294
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,750
Kurokawa!

295
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,740
Be careful!

296
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,780
Don't drop your guard.

297
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,260
I'll be fine.

298
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,740
She's just a good-for-nothing fat-ass.

299
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,170
Uchi-mata!

300
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,170
It's over.



301
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,170
Now's your chance!

302
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,420
Diet!

303
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,600
Yes! Give her the taste of your Konaki-jiji!

304
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,430
Wow.

305
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,430
Good going! Crush her!

306
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,890
Good, keep her down!

307
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,760
Are you nuts?

308
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,400
Don't do an Uchi Mata! She's huge!

309
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,700
B-But, I thought she looked so weak.

310
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,190
Come on! Get out of it!

311
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,410
Good! Get out from the side!
Come on! Get out of it!

312
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,330
Crush her! Sayuri! Crush her! Sayuri!

313
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,850
Jigoro-san, don't tell me you only taught her Osaekomi?

314
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,340
That's right.





315
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,760
However...

316
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,340
That's the position!

317
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,320
Osaekomi, in.

318
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,190
Amazing.

319
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,080
Yes! That's how you do it!

320
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,350
Squash her!
Yes! That's how you do it!

321
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,350
However, she's just heavy.

322
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,060
No! You're losing it!

323
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,420
She's getting out of it!

324
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,210
That's the Kurokawa we know! Runner-up at the National Championships.

325
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,570
I think the other girl just sucks.

326
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,530
That's it! Go, Kurokawa!

327
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,540
Oh no, it's over.

328
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,000
Ude-hishigi-juji-gatame!

329
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,920
Yes! We win!

330
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,470
Ow!

331
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,730
Let me go!

332
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,820
That hurts!

333
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,440
Let me go!

334
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,730
Stop crying, Sayuri!

335
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,260
Take her down, Sayuri!

336
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,450
Oh, I don't think she has a chance anymore.

337
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,060
Well, she did her best.

338
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,900
Inokuma-san, please hurry!

339
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,250
Let me go!

340
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,090
Oh no. Why?
Let me go!

341
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,370
Why won't she give up?

342
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,740
Why?

343
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,370
Why won't she give up?

344
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,160
Why?

345
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,420
Let me go!

346
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,380
You have to give up!

347
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,880
You need to give up right now!

348
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,890
Your arm's going to break.

349
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,890
Why? Why doesn't she give up?

350
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,640
Oh, shoot!

351
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,390
I forgot to tell her how to give up.

352
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,290
What are you doing?

353
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,360
Just give up right now!

354
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,860
Inokuma-san, please hurry!

355
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,370
Why won't she give up?

356
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,920
Ow!

357
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,010
Let me go!

358
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,890
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 502 Days

359
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,440
Oh, silly me, I forgot to teach her how to give up.

360
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,630
She has to give up, or she's going to break her arm.

361
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,490
It's strange that Yawara isn't here by now.

I hope she didn't actually go skiing or something.

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,340
Next time on Yawara:

Secret Technique! Swan Lake!

365
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll pull an Ouchi-gari on you if you're not careful.
