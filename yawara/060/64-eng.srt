1
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,710
MWJC, number three, Oda Mari, disqualified!

2
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,460
What? Why? Why? Why?

3
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,460
Inokuma-san, help me!

4
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,460
No! Get away from her!

5
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,520
It's not safe to be stuck!

6
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,570
Get away!

7
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,380
Your shouts won't reach her from here.

8
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,460
Matsuda-san...

9
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,310
Inokuma-san!</i>

10
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,560
She's doing it for me?

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,070
That's right.

12
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,920
Fujiko-san worked her butt off and formed a judo team...

13
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,940
so that you could return to judo whenever you want to.

14
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,040
Inokuma-san, please come! Hurry!</i>

15
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,540
Inokuma-san! Hurry!</i>

16
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:45,260
"I Think I'll Try"

17
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,850
Twenty seconds left!

18
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,530
Will you hurry up, Uzaki?!

19
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,650
Get her!

20
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,650
Hurry, before Inokuma gets here!

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,110
Hah! We've already scored a Waza-ari!

22
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,370
Keep fending her off, and we'll win, Fujiko-san!

23
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,000
Dammit!

24
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,640
Kyonkyon!</i>

25
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,580
You're actually going to fight!</i>

26
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,330
Don't do it! You'll get killed!</i>

27
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,380
Fujiko-san, what's distracting youâ€”

28
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,850
That's an ex-ballerina for you. Gotta admire her balance.

29
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,350
Why, you...

30
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,930
Inokuma-san, hurry! Come on!</i>

31
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,580
So you aren't coming, Yawara-san?</i>

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,820
Then again...</i>

33
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,320
Let's go. Everyone's waiting for you!

34
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,780
You want to cover me again?

35
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,290
That's not it!

36
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,180
This isn't the time to be arguing over something so irrelevant! Why can't you understand?

37
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,920
Do whatever you want!



38
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,560
Why did I say that to Yawara-san?</i>

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,930
Now she's not going to come even if she wanted to.</i>

40
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,390
You stupid little...

41
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,940
Ow!

42
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,990
Don't fall! There are only five seconds left!

43
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,900
Get away from her!

44
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,610
What are you doing?

45
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,440
I don't care what you do. Just win!

46
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,570
Gotcha!

47
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,160
Done! 

48
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,180
She won, didn't she? Fujiko-san won, right?

49
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,850
She won!

50
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,760
Cool!

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,330
All right!

52
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,770
Fujiko-san!

53
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,390
Wow, that tall girl held her off!

54
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,320
In any case, we've reached a showdown between the vice captains.

55
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,530
I-I'm done!

56
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,990
F-Fujiko-san!

57
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,910
She's groggy!

58
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,480
Start the match before Inokuma gets here!

59
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Tsukushi U, Vice Captain, Katori Shinobu-kun!

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,020
Oh man, you know who's gonna win.

61
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,620
Even that tall girl's not gonna make it against Katori, the under 66 kg champ.

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,770
And if she loses, then that frail-looking waif is up next.

63
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,020
Where the hell is Inokuma?




64
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,980
Um, yeah, well...

65
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,030
Dammit, he fed us a bunch of crap!

66
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,780
Keep doing this and <i>All Sports News</i>
will become a pariah.

67
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,610
Let's go, guys!

68
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,030
Yeah, let's!

69
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,240
H-Hey, wait!

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,910
Are you all right, Fujiko-san?

71
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Looks like she's not.

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,220
I'm... fine. Kyonkyon, where are you?

73
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,960
Fujiko-san.

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
Kyonkyon!

75
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,750
Don't worry!

76
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll keep going till Inokuma-san comes!

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,890
Fujiko-san.

78
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,260
Come forward!

79
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:13,910
F-Fujiko-san!

80
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,770
I have to go.
F-Fujiko-san!

81
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,550
D-Don't worry!

82
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,730
This ballerina body of mine may bend, but it won't break!

83
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,740
Sheesh, talk about a waste of time!

84
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,720
The editors even had an "Inokuma Returns" headline ready to print!

85
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,240
Excuse me, can you let me through?

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,530
Please let me through!

87
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,040
Inokuma Yawara!

88
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,790
Hajime!


89
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,890
Come on, Katori! Don't play footsie with her!

90
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,810
Put her away before Inokuma gets here!

91
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,850
Fujiko-san! Un, deux, trois!

92
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,480
Yeah, un, deux, trois!

93
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,700
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois!

94
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,740
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois!</i>

95
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,700
Un, deux...

96
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,120
Yuko!

97
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,380
It's in the bag!

98
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,470
Pin her down!

99
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,470
Tie your long legs around her, Fujiko-san!

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Quit dawdling, Katori! You're the national champ, remember?

101
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,490
Osaekomi attained!

102
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,500
Yes! She's got it!

103
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,490
That's all you need to do, you moron!

104
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,430
Guess that's all she wrote.

105
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,420
What is that ditz up to now, anyway?

106
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,150
Fujiko-san...

107
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,880
Let me through!

108
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,800
Ten seconds into hold!

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,880
Is Fujiko-san going to lose?

110
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,890
No!

111
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,720
M-My Fujiko-san is not going to lose!

112
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,680
Twenty seconds into hold!


113
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,510
Darn, I can't move an inch!</i>

114
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,690
Forgive me, Kyonkyon! You're going in, after all!</i>

115
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,560
Fujiko-san!

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:39,740
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois!

117
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,410
Forget it. That's not <i>Swan Lake</i> at all!

118
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,710
It's <i>The Dying Swan!</i>

119
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,170
Y-Yawara-san?

120
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,470
Y-You...

121
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,540
It's Inokuma!

122
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,470
Inokuma came!

123
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,010
Inokuma Yawara is here!

124
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,480
She's here!

125
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,530
Twenty-five seconds into hold! Waza-ari!

126
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,880
Fujiko-san! Fujiko-san!

127
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,410
Inokuma-san...</i>

128

Inokuma-san's voice...</i>

Fujiko-san!

Fujiko-san!

Fujiko-san.

143
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,470
I-I have to go in!

144
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,300
I have to keep going, or Kyonkyon will be up!

145
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
Stop. That's enough, Fujiko-san.

146
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,670
You did your best.

147
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,900
But that's enough. You don't need to go in there again.

148
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,290
D-Did I lose?



149
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,860
It was an Ippon by a Yoko Shiho Gatame.

150
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,830
Forgive me, Kyonkyon!

151
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,510
I couldn't do it, no matter how hard I tried!

152
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,600
That's not true, Fujiko-san.

153
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,140
I-Ino... Ino...

154
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,680
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san.

155
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,980
Inokuma-san!

156
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,020
You were really amazing!

157
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,650
I've never seen such a superb Ouchi Gari.

158
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,050
You're the real Inokuma-san, right? You're real, right?

159
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,990
I'm truly sorry, Fujiko-san.



160
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,170
She's finally here. I was getting worried for a minute there.

161
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,950
I knew this would happen.

162
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,440
Macchan, you've been chasing after her for so long,

163
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,960
but you still don't know a single thing about her.

164
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,970
Well, her dramatic entrance should liven up this silly, rinky-dink match.

165
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,400
Sh-She's here!

166
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,930
She's really here!

167
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,370
What should we do?

168
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,940

Kaori, you were in the World Cup with Inokuma Yawara.

173
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,500
You must have something up your sleeve, right?

174
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,460
A secret strategy against Inokuma-san...

175
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,090
You know full well...

176
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,380
I don't have one!

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,430
O-Our number one spot!

179
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:30,430
During the World Cup, I saw with my own eyes just how fearsome Inokuma Yawara is.

180
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,000
Belgium's Queen Belkens was at the top of her game.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,050
But she couldn't demonstrate her judo skills, because Inokuma tossed her around like a rag doll.

182
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,150
The World Free-Weight title holder, Teleshikova,

183
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,420
was perfectly prepared for Inokuma. She'd even researched her judo moves thoroughly.

184
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,370
Despite that, she still...








185
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,320
Even if we fought her all at once, we'd probably still lose.

186
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,340
I wish all five of you <i>had</i> lost to Inokuma Yawara.

187
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,980
The real problem here is that a group of rank amateurs

188
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,230
lasted this long against the top team!



189
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,100
Defeating Inokuma Yawara is the only way to recover from this disgrace!

190
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,140
Now stop looking so pathetic!

191
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,150
But you look just as pathetic!

192
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,820
All right!


193
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,110
This match is ours for the taking!

194
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,110
We're kicking the top team around, practice game or not!

195
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,620
Inokuma-san, show them what you're made of!

196
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,080
Okay.

197
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,860
We're going to become overnight stars!

198
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh well, there goes my private life!

199
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,640
You must be happy to walk out of here alive, Kyonkyon!

200
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,400
Um...

201
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,420
I wonder if we'll start with a record debut?

202
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,070
I hope I don't have to do any variety shows!

203
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,310
I'm okay with commercials!

204
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,470
I think I'll compete.

205
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,520
Wh-What did you say just now?

206
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,570
Well, I... you see...


207
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,740
Because I saw Fujiko-san give it her all,

208
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,730
I've never felt this way before.

209
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,220
It's like there's something burning in my chest.

210
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,500
I don't know how to explain it.

211
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,460
So I think I'll compete in this match.

212
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,020
Don't you dare!

213
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,990
What about our celebrity debut?!

214
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,390
Yeah, you need to stay put!

215
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,720
They'll kill you!

216
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,960
But...

217
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,100
You should do it!

218
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,240
Inokuma-san, do you think I can?

219
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,780
It'll be fine! You can do it if you have the will!

220
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,780
Isn't that right, Fujiko-san?

221
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,930
Yes, even I was able to do it.

222
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,240
You're the captain, Kyonkyon!

223
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,190
What the hell?!

224
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,790
Inokuma-san, Fujiko-san, what's going through your heads?

225
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,600
What? Kyonkyon's going to compete?

226
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,230
Y-Yeah. It just sort of happened.

227
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,980
What is she thinking?

228
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,800
Hold it.

229
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,770
But this match was set up to get Yawara-san back into judo!

230
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,600
You really don't get Yawara, do you?


231
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,600
She's already come back to judo.

232
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,610
Just look at her eyes. They always twinkle like that during matches.

233
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,130
We've accomplished our goal without putting her into this two-bit match.

234
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,220
We'll now resume the match!

235
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,600
MWJC, Captain, come forward!

236
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,410
Don't let up, Katori!

237
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,090
Even Inokuma has a weak spot!

238
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,060
Wh-What the...

239
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,390
What about Inokuma?



240
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,030
Does MWJC know she's their last player?

241
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,790
Good luck, Kyonkyon!

242
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,070
You can do it!

243
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,370
R-Rei!

244
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,130
Dammit!


245
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,850
They think we're a joke, Coach!

246
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,870
No.

247
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,160
Inokuma Jigoro's judo precepts are,

248
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,750
"The flexible command the strong," and "The small command the large."


249
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,460
That shrimp might actually be...

250
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,850
Hajime!

251
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,470
Watch out, Katori!

252
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,720
That shrimp might actually be good!

253
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,760
Hang in there, Kyonkyon!

254
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,320
There's nothing you can't do!

255
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,320
Th-This is...

256
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,860
Wh-Why?

257
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,250
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...
It's like she doesn't even want to engage me!

258
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:26,440
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

259
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,440
Wh-What is this?!</i>

260
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,750
What in God's name is she counting?</i>

261
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,450
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

262
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,430
Wow! Kyonkyon overwhelmed her opponent just by grabbing her!

263
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,450
She can do it! I think she can do it!

264
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,960
So what's her special move?

265
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,510
Special...

266
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,920
...move?

267
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,030
Yes. Like Paddy-field's Deashi Barai, or Yoshinagawa-san's Osaekomi.

268
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,590
She must have a special move, right?

269
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,290
She doesn't have one.

270
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,600
But didn't Grandpa teach each of you a move?



271
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
That's right. I didn't teach that girl a thing.

272
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,270
That's why we needed you out there!

273
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,610
Oh, no!

274
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,610
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

275
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,570
Note: "The Dish Mansion at Bancho" is a Japanese ghost story of love separated by social class.#
Quit acting like you're in "The Dish Mansion at Bancho"!</i>

276
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,830
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

277
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,620
Jougai!
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

278
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,780
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

279
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,580
Mate!
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

280
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,330
Shido!

281
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,380
Shido!

282
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,460
Hey, hey, hey! This is judo, not folk dancing!

283
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,380
Bring out Inokuma!

284
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,310
Yeah, we want Inokuma!

285
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,310
Inokuma! Inokuma!

286
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,340
Inokuma-san, look!
Inokuma! Inokuma!

287
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,350
I thought that was how you did it.</i>
Inokuma-san, look!
Inokuma! Inokuma!

288
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,350
Inokuma! Inokuma!
I thought that was how you did it.</i>

289
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,360
I thought that was how you did it.</i>

290
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,350
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

291
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,660
A Deashi Barai?

292
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,320
Yeah! That's a Deashi Barai!

293
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,320
Did she pick that up from practicing with me?

294
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,280
Ah, I don't know.

295
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,240
Kyonkyon, use that!

296
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,240
When I say "now," do that!

297
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
Inokuma-san.

298
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,300
Hajime!

299
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,670
Katori, you're not gonna win by backing away! Just take her down!

300
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,170
Do whatever it takes! Anything, just win!

301
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,800
I know, but I've never had
 an opponent this creepy!</i>

302
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,140
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

303
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,100
Will you stop counting?!

304
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,940
Now!

305
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,120
It's... It's just an Asai!

306
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,350
Hey, stop being sloppy!

307
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,090
That idiot. She must've snapped from all that fear!

308
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,300
Kyonkyon?

309
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,270
Kyonkyon.

310
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,600
Are you awake?

311
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,280
Fujiko-san, what about the match?

312
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,950
It's over.

313
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,190
W-We lost, didn't we?

314
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,340
It doesn't matter anymore.

315
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,740
Kyonkyon, girls, thank you.

316
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,960
Because of you, Inokuma-san has come back to judo.

317
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,010
You all worked very hard. It didn't matter if we won or lost.

318
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,890
Of course it did! Aren't you pissed?!

319
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,390
You gotta be! Especially after all that grueling training!

320
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,200
I was <i>this</i> close to my celebrity debut!



321
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,740
This is worse than being called a fatty!

322
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,940
This is worse than being shot down by a guy!

323
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,430
But we were facing the national champs!

324
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,910
I'm also disappointed!

325
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,490
Oh, geez.

326
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,490
So they were just a bunch of newbies, huh?

327
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,920
Boy, did we get suckered.

328
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,590
Anyway, thank heaven we won.

329
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,560
Excuse me, but can we have another match?

330
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,570
Not right now, of course, but when we're much better.

331
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,580
I wish to have another sparring match!

332
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,480
Uh, yeah, you see...

333
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,090
Th-This is just great. Next time we'll be facing Inokuma!</i>

334
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,100
Our number one spot will be nothing but a...</i>

335
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,090
A sparring match? Don't waste your time!




336
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,630
The Ajisai Cup is coming up in two months!

337
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,050
You know, the one for intermural women's teams!

338
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,400
No way! We're not doing an official match.

339
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,140
Wait a minute.</i>



340
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,500
We may have been soft on those hapless novices,</i>

341
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,060
but next time I'll just have my first player take care of those four,</i>

342
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,780
then pit all five of my players against Inokuma Yawara,</i>

343
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,610
who is certain to suffer her first loss against the top team in the nation!</i>

344
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,160
Sign: Number One In Japan#
who is certain to suffer her first loss against the top team in the nation!</i>

345
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,660
Oh, we'd love to! Let's face each other at the Ajisai Cup!

346
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,380
All right! Inokuma's entering the Ajisai Cup!

347
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,510
Finally, we'll see her Ippon Seoi at a real match again!

348
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,320
E-Excuse me...

350
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,980
So you finally said you'd compete in a match!

351
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,460
But I was just...

352
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,640
Oh no, you said you'd compete, and a judoka always keeps her word!

353
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,990
You have a match coming up, Yawara.




354
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,200
Any more of your shilly-shallying during practice, and I'll disown you!

355
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,520
Really, this is getting ridiculous!

356
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,850
But they really did give it their all.

357
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,890
Yawara!

358
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,870
Fujiko, Love, and Judo.

359
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,760
You'll feel my Deashi Barai if you don't watch out!
