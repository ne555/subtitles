1
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,740
The Ajisai Cup? She's going to appear in the Intermural Women's Tournament?

2
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,450
Inokuma is aiming for the national championship at the tournament?

3
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,640
So she's avoiding a face-off with me in order to show off at that tournament?

4
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,960
Darn! She's always thinking of new ways to show me up!

5
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,930
Tokunaga, please enter me into that tournament immediately.

6
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,930
Everybody Wants to Beat Yawara!

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,970
Come on! Quit slacking off and move it!

8
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,790
The tournament's coming soon!

9
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,940
I can't go on!
The tournament's coming soon!

10
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,090
Don't you fall asleep on me, Marilyn!



11
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,940
You start lollygagging, and it's another lap!

12
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,760
Oh God, I'm dying!

13
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,950
Can it, willya? Just hearing you moan doubles my fatigue!

14
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,950
Who's the one who said we could relax because Inokuma-san's here?

15
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,190
Becoming celebrities or idols ain't gonna be easy!

16
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,960
So quit whining and move your butt!



17
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,070
But I'll become a muscle-bound idol if I keep doing this!

18
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,510
I can feel the calories burning!

19
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,060
Fujiko-san, you're totally amazing!

20
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,630
You did ten laps of belly crawls, reverse shrimps,

21
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,520
and one-legged hops in no time.

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,850
Come on.

23
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,140
That's nothing.


24
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,490
You did more than twice as many reverse shrimps and one-legged hops as we did.

25
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,530
It's because I do those every day.

26
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,190
Yawara! What are you flapping your gums for?

27
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,710
Since you're all slacking off, I'm adding five hundred Uchi Komi to the list!

28
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,830
What did you say?

29
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,710
Five hundred Uchi Komi?

30
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,040
I'm going home.

31
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,160
You can't! We just started!

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,720
But I'm dying here!

33
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,730
If we don't do our best, we'll lose again at the Ajisai Cup Intermural Women's Tournament.

34
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,090
Yes, Kyonkyon is right!

35
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,690
If you start losing heart now, you'll lose again!

36
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,670
God, I don't want to go through that disappointment again!

37
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,740
I'm already pissed off about being rejected all the time!

38
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,750
I'm losing weight, so I'll do whatever it takes!




39
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,210
You guys...

40
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,510
Hey, no daydreaming!

41
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,670
Okay!

42
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,290
Inokuma-san is simply radiant and glowing!

43
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,030
Oh, that's just the light coming off her sweat.

44
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,440
That's not what I meant.

45
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,940
Whenever Inokuma-san practices judo, she really shines.

46
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,160
I want to become just like that.

47
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,640
You will!

48
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,940
If you work hard, you'll shine just like her!

49
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,620
That goes for you too, Marilyn.

50
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,340
You'll be even more lovely.

51
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,670
More lovely?

52
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,410
I'm not sure I want that.

53
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,890
If I get any sexier than this,

54
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,260
even my future fellow celebrities will be jealous of me.


55
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,570
Kyonkyon, you need to get started.

56
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,060
Marilyn-san!

57
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,200
I want to win this tournament for them.

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,500
Yawara! What's distracting you?!

59
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,320
Sorry!

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,000
It looks like they're actually serious this time.

61
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,450
Oh my, Konoike-san, what a lovely dress you're wearing!

62
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,530
Please, you look strikingly elegant yourself, Sayaka-san.

63
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,730
You're embarrassing me.
 This is just my housedress.

64
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,390
Whenever I receive an invitation from you, I'm always unsure about what to wear.

65
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,850
Am I right, girls?

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,930
Sayaka-san, I hope you'll introduce me to your guests soon.

67
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,360
Your lovely schoolmates from Seishin Women's School.

68
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,880
There is someone I'd like you to meet.

69
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,060
My fiancé, Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke-san.

70
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,090
So this is the famous Kazamatsuri-san?


71
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,600
I'd expect nothing less from your discerning eyes!

72
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,840
My name is Gotoda Sumire.

73
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,100
I'm Ogami Kasumi. Very pleased to meet you.

74
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,030
I'm Jujo Michiko.

75
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,570
And I'm Konoike Reiko.

76
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,200
I've heard so much about you.

77
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,310
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you all.

78
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,920
Um, if I may bother you for your numbers...

79
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,170
So what do you think of them, Kazamatsuri-san?

80
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,440
Well, I must say they have both brains and beauty.

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,220
And since they're wealthy heiresses,
 they really make a complete package.

82
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,970
I can honestly say they're perfect in every way.

83
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,960
What on earth are you talking about?

84
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,230
Don't you know what the five of us are doing here?

85
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,740
We're the members of Seishin Women's School's judo team!

86
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,950
Wait just a second.

87
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,980
Um, can you tell me how much judo experience you have?

88
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,610
If it's flower arrangement...

89
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,940
We're quite well-versed in the tea ceremony.


90
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,950
We've had a taste for calligraphy since we were children.

91
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,930
We've also dabbled in Japanese dancing.

92
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,200
This is nuts, Sayaka-san!

93
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,330
There's nothing crazy about my plan.

94
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:50,720
I can easily win the Ajisai Cup Women's Intermural Tournament all alone.

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,700
All I need are some other members.

96
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,860
The best upper-crust women's judo team in the nation has been formed,

97
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,010
so that Inokuma Yawara and I can have our decisive match!

98
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,100
We're very happy to help, Sayaka-san!

99
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,550
Our families have known each other for ages.

100
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,400
I don't mind doing a thing or two for your judo team.





101
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,640
Will we have matching judogi?

102
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,930
Perhaps tailored from Kyoto so-shibori fabrics?

103
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,390
How delightful!

104
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,360
I can't take it!

105
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,400
At this rate, I'm going to keel over and die!

106
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,590
I thought your kind could survive a nuclear blast.

107
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,930
What are you talking about?

108
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,370
Look at all these scratches on my delicate skin!

109
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,660
Now then, where should we eat?

110
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,670
Aren't you on a diet?


111
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:51,380
All the training has burned off a ton of calories, enough for three helpings of katsudon.

112
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,130
Huh?

113
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,760
Where's Fujiko-san?

114
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,140
She said she's staying back because her Uchi Komi aren't as good as yours.

115
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,140
Geez, and she's already worn out. I'll go get her.

116
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,150
Sign: The "Gentle Way" Is Not Built in a Day

117
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,800
I don't get it.

118
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,570
How can I get them to be like Inokuma-san's?

119
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,080
If only Hanazono-san were here.

120
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,840
G-Good night!

121
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,220
But Hanazono-san is busy with his own practice.



122
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,440
Who are you?

123
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,900
Is Inokuma Jigoro coaching you?

124
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,110
Um, yes.

125
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,950
But I'm still not good enough, even after three months of this.

126
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,990
You started three months ago?

127
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,370
Not bad at all.

128
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,380
Just get the timing down when pulling with your left arm, and it'll be perfect.
Sign: Kaki-pea

129
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,120
Just get the timing down when pulling with your left arm, and it'll be perfect.

130
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,840
Okay.

131
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,360
Fujiko-sa—

132
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,890
Wow, she's <i>still</i> going.

133
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,070
Huh?

134
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,310
That's incredible, Fujiko-san!

135
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,620
Inokuma-san!

136
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,840
Your pulling has gotten a lot better. It's perfect now!

137
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,960
You're amazing, Fujiko-san!

138
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,370
Thank you. I got some pointers.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Pointers? From my grandpa?

140
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,640
No, from a man I've never seen before.

141
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,640
I asked for his name, but he said he was just a passing judoka.

142
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,860
Are you kidding?



143
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,870
This persimmon-seed wafer...

144
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,660
This wafer...

145
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,370
Dad?

146
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,000
Inokuma-san?

147
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,540

Matsuda-san?

152
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,410
Early morning training? Good for you!

153
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,870
Why are you up so early?

154
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,380
I just got back from an all-nighter!

155
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,590
Man, the morning sun is so bright!

156
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,420
You're oddly perky for someone who just pulled an all-nighter.

157
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,660
It's all mind over matter!

158
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,560
Here's the paper!

159
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,000
I wanted to show you that.

160
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,730
Headline: Honami to Appear in Ajisai Cup Intermural Women's Tournament!! A Long Awaited Rematch Against Yawara!?

161
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,190
Sayaka-san!

162
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,300
That's right!

163
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,130
I can still remember how you beat Honami Sayaka by default

164
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,380
when she hurt her ankle in last year's National Championship!




165
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,270
After two years, we'll finally get to see your fated rematch with Sayaka,

166
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,220
whom you threw instantly in the Oshiuri TV Cup.

167
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,790
Huh?



168
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,800
You might get your rematch against your fated rival!

169
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,270
I don't think of her as my fated rival.

170
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,770
Even if you don't, you know she thinks that way about you.

171
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,270
She went and put together a judo team of heiresses after you entered the tournament.

172
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,650
Even if her teammates are weak, she'll beat everybody else as a one-woman team,

173
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,240
just for a chance to fight you!

174
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,380
That's right.





175
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,750
There's no such thing as a one-woman team.

176
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,520
I want everyone to get better.

177
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,970
They're all working hard so that we can beat them together.

178
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,470
Are you talking about your teammates from MWJC?

179
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,390
I want to win it for them because they're giving it their all.

180
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,060
But you can't do that to them.



181
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,940
Makes sense, considering those girls.

182
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,950
Every skilled competitor from around the country is coming.

183
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,710
I don't think they're ready to face them yet.

184
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,140
This is no time to worry about them!

185
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,960
But I guess you're always like this.

186
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,800
Come on. Let's keep running!

187
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,430
You're training, remember?

188
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,830
I've seen a lot of athletes in this line of work,

189
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,160
and I have to say, the scariest are the ones brimming with confidence.

190
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,410
Confidence?



191
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,150
The world's gold medalist should be teaching that to them with her body.

192
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,420
You should be training each of them one-on-one.


193
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,450
If you're serious about it, they're sure to catch on.

194
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,260
Then they'll have confidence!

195
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,010
If they get to throw you.

196
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,940
Matsuda-san!

197
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,960
I'll do that.

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,620
Thank you very much!

199
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,700
Good luck at the tourney!

200
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,010
I'm sure your father will be watching closely!

201
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,290
I think so too.

202
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,640
Man, son of a gun.

203
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,360
Does she always run that fast?

204
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,040
Next!

205
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,860
My, what lovely teacups these are!

206
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,840
These Meissen teacups are dreadfully hard to get.



207
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,890
Not to mention the tea's deep, profound Darjeeling aroma and splendid amber hue.

208
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,790
Sayaka-san has always had impeccable tastes.

209
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,880
Would you care to join us, Kazamatsuri-san?

210
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,050
We're having some tea.

211
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,620
Oh, sure. That's sounds nice.

212
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,840
B-But...

213
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,290
Sayaka-san...

214
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,310
Kazamatsuri-san, by all means join them for tea.

215
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,920
O-Okay.

216
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,190
I'll take you up on that, then.

217
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,610
You can't be serious!

218
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,890
Your teammates aren't doing even an ounce of training!

219
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,330
Is that what you want?

220
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,810
It's quite all right.

221
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,370
I'll win every single one of our matches by myself.

222
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,120
Next!

223
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,460
Okay!

224
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,920
But...

225
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,180
From what I've heard, isn't MWJC's judo team also filled with rank amateurs?

226
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,930
Inokuma Yawara.




227
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,270
I'll dispose of the first four players quickly.

228
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,380
Then that girl will step forward as the captain.

229
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,530
She probably plans to sweep through all five of us in order to hog the applause!

230
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,090
I won't let her have that pleasure!

231
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,240
I simply cannot allow Inokuma Yawara to do whatever she pleases.

232
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,580
I'll show her who is the real queen.

233
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,650
Such intensity...

234
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,550
Oh my, what a sumptuous cake!

235
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,220
This is certainly a masterpiece from Sayaka-san's private French chef!

236
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,560
How much sugar would you like, Kazamatsuri-san?

237
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,560
Ah, just one!

238
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,430
I'll take three.

239
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,820
Kojiro-san!

240
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,270
Wh-Who are you?

241
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,270
MWJC's team...

242
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,070
is not composed of a bunch of amateurs.

243
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,660
Miss Sayaka might lose before she faces Yawara.

244
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,950
N-No way!

245
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,050
MWJC will be a huge obstacle, even without Yawara.

246
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,250
And I mean huge.

247
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,700
Even without Yawara?






248
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,720
Inokuma Yawara, I'll settle matters with you!

249
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,120
Yes, that's the spirit!

250
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,270
Now, don't let go of that!

251
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,520
You're the top women's judo team in the nation!

252
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,150
You'll prove that by beating Inokuma Yawara!

253
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,370
I did it! That one was perfect, wasn't it?

254
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,900
Yes, it was. Don't forget that timing, Paddy-field!

255
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,710
You were awesome, Paddy-field!

256
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,630
Yes, you were, Paddy-field!

257
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,130
All right!

258
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,560
Yes, use the lever principle to your advantage!

259
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,350
Go ahead and try it!

260
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,520
Yes, that's the way!

261
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,730
Come in closer, Yoshinagawa-san!

262
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,610
Pull me in so I'm slamming into your chest!

263
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,820
I know they're just practicing,

264
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,300
but it's a real scoop to get pictures of Yawara-san getting expertly thrown.

265
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,620
You got that right.

266
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,800
But are you sure Yawara-san should be doing this, Matsuda-san?

267
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,680
She'll be fine.

268
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,950
In any case, look at her teammates.


269
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,170
Their maneuvers are worlds apart from that other match they played.

270
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,090
They're soaking in Yawara-san's timing and rhythm directly.

271
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,180
You can't have a better practice partner than her!

272
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,250
Yay! I did it!

273
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,150
That's the way, Marilyn!

274
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,150
Once you add more momentum, it'll be perfect!

275
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,540
Matsuda-san, do you need a bib for all that drool?

276
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,570
Fujiko-san!



277
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,570
I know, I'm still not there yet.

278
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,650
What? It almost looks as if she actually got beat.

279
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,040
That's Yawara-san for you.
 She even takes a fall like a champ.

280
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,450
Can't you see, Matsuda, you moron?

281
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,840
See what exactly?

282
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,340
That Ouchi Gari was the real deal.

283
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,810
What?

284
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,690
This tournament might be more fun than I thought.

285
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,090
Sign: The Ajisai Cup Women's Intermural Tournament

286
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,400
We will now introduce the 16 female college teams who will compete

287
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,050
in this year's Ajisai Cup Women's Intermural Tournament!

288
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:14,560
Of course, all eyes will be on the five-time champions, Tsukushi University;

289
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,560
on Honami Sayaka and her newly formed team from Seishin Women's School;

290
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,560
and not least, on Mitsuba Women's Junior College,

291
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,840
led by world free-weight champion Inokuma Yawara!





292
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,660
They're making their first appearance!

293
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,870
Since women's judo will finally be an official event at the Barcelona Olympics,

294
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,830
this is all that more exciting!

295
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,910
The festival for female college athletes,

296
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,900
the Ajisai Cup Women's Intermural Tournament.

297
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,880
Which college will the Goddess of Victory smile upon today?

298
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,890
The Barcelona Olympics in 453 Days

299
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,970
We're finally at the tournament!

300
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,750
Yawara! Have you tightened up that fundoshi?

301
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,810
Grandpa!

302
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,770
Everybody's really nervous.

303
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,680
They've practiced so hard. They can win, right?

304
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,900
Of course they can.

305
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,220
Anybody coached by me always gets the "W".

306
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,270
Yawara!

307
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,290
The Huge Obstacle.

308
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:17,830
You'll get my Ude Garami if you don't watch.

309
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,350
<b>The Huge Obstacle
You'll get my Ude Garami if you don't watch.</b>

310
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,790
<b>The Huge Obstacle</b>

311
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,680
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.

312
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:47,030
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
