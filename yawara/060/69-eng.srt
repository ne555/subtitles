00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,410
I've loved him.

I've always been waiting.

I showed off whenever he was around.

But I acted cool, like I didn't care.

My career and love life?

I do think they're both important.

But when I see his smile,

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,150
I know it's what I want the most.

He proposed to me; was it real?

I feel like I'm stuck in a crosswalk.

It's so unbelievable.

The world is silent and completely still,

As you and I see each other, eye to eye.

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,310
She's finally here! MWJC's team captain, Inokuma Yawara!

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,820
This is her first official match since the World Cup!

22
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,410
The excitement from that day is coming alive once again!

23
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,050
Yawara.

24
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,460
This won't be like the last time.

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,430
I've studied your Ippon Zeoi thoroughly.

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:16,440
You Can Do It, Kyonkyon<i>!</i>

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,600
Hajime!

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
It's underway!

29
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,600
Saito-san, you know Inokuma defeated Tohdoh two years ago with an Ippon Zeoi.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,130
How do you think this match will turn out?

31
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,130
What do you think, Saito-san?

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,800
Saito-san?

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,570
Please keep it down!

34
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,840
It might be over in an instant!

35
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,540
Come on, hit me with your Ippon Zeoi!

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,690
I've studied the timing of your Ippon Zeoi thoroughly!

37
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,650
Get her! Get her!
Hang in there, Inokuma-san!

38
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,900
Throw her down!

39
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,160
Go, go! Get her, get her!

40
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,570
H-Honey! That's Inokuma Yawara!

41
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,030
She won the World Cup!



42
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,080
No way! Why is Fujiko playing judo with such an amazing person?

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,160
There must be some mistake!

44
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,960
No, there's no mistake.


45
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,450
Inokuma wanted to quit judo at one point.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,740
Fujiko-san was the one who brought her back!

47
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,270
Their friendship is magnificent!

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,530
Seeing her compete again in an official match makes me extremely happy!

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,220
What the hell?

50
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,490
I thought it was only Fujiko,
 but Inokuma Yawara as well?

51
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,900
So you're two-timing our daughter, you philanderer?!



52
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,720
How dare you play around with Fujiko's feelings?!

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,130
N-No, wait! Yes, Inokuma was my first love, but...

54
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,630
Hey, where's that Ippon Zeoi?

55
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,890
Let's watch her.

56
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,550
The match might be over before you know it.

57
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,550
Don't try to fool us!

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,520
Inokuma-san will win, right?


59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,210
She will. But if you don't watch, it might be over so fast you'll miss it, Kyonkyon.

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,960
Your defense is non-existent!

61
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,330
Here it is!

62
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,290
There it is!

63
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,540
Her Ippon Zeoi!

64
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,590
Now I'll just pull her down and get her in an Okuri Eri Jime!

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
I gotcha! The undefeated Yawara is no more!

66
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,660
I-Inokuma!

67
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,320
Ippon! Done!

68
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
Tohdoh-san?

69
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,170
Tohdoh-san!

70
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,960
Inokuma wins with an Ippon!

71
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,170
Tohdoh fell while doing a somersault, and now she can't get up!

72
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,820
Well, that certainly wasn't an Ippon Zeoi, Saito-san.

73
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,600
It was an Ouchi Gari! Exactly like Ito Fujiko's trademark move!

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,910
Tohdoh-saâ€”





75
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,060
Thank goodness, you're awake.

76
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,340
Inokuma Yawara.

77
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,360
What about the match?

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,470
Y-You lost!

79
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,690
Wha...?

80
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,970
What did you say?

81
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,490
Y-You have to be kidding me!

82
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,410
I studied her Ippon Zeoi thoroughly!

83
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,330
Hold it! That match didn't count!

84
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,290
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,040
The MWJC team is dancing wildly! They now advance to the semis!

86
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,510
Thank you, Inokuma-san! You showed me how to do a real Ouchi Gari!

87
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,800
Actually, I wasn't trying to.

88
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,340
She's really outstanding.

89
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,220
B-Banzai!



90
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,970
With this, we have our top four teams lined up.

91
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,050
Our next match is Tsukushi U. vs. Saikai University,

92
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,700
then a head-to-head match between MWJC and Honami Sayaka's Seishin Women's School.

93
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Finally, Inokuma Yawara.

94
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,650
The time has come, Miss Sayaka.



95
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,210
You won't make it to Yawara if you don't tighten up those strings.

96
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,350
Sign: Players' Waiting Room B

97
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,000
Now <i>this</i> is Darjeeling.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,910
It has a very nice aroma.
Now <i>this</i> is Darjeeling.

99
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,320
Sayaka-sama, aren't you going to join us for tea?

100
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm quite all right.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,460
Sign: Players' Waiting Room A

102
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,760
Mom, Dad, what are you doing here?

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,120
We're not doing anything except taking you home!

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,950
That's right, Fujiko!

105
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,340
Wh-What are you saying?

106
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,020
I'm Inokuma Yawara, the one Fujiko-san is always taking care of.

107
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,950
Oh, I'm sure that's not true at all.

108
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,760
I'll bet Fujiko's been getting <i>your</i> attention.

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,400
No, she really...

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,910
At home, we watched you during the World Cup.

111
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,740
Whenever Granny was around, she'd cheer so much her dentures would come loose, right, dear?

112
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,780
Honey, the gifts!

113
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,430
Oh, that's right.

114
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,080
It's nothing much, just some homemade tea. Here.

115
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,370
Oh, please...




116
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,330
Now this is really something.

117
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,290
We'll be taking it immediately.

118
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,070
Come on, let's go, Fujiko.

119
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,070
Mom!

120
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,550
Judo is too much for you!

121
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,050
Hold it!

122
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,640
Now this is good tea.

123
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,410
Just accept the fact she tricked you, let her see it through, then go.

124
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,610
You can always decide about making her quit judo afterwards.

125
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,680
No!



126
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,860
We must take her away from that strange man immediately!

127
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,700
W-Wait, Hanazono-kun isn't a "strange man."

128
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,870
Fujiko-san...

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,430
Fujiko, you...

130
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,370
Y-You... You...

131
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,880
H-Hanazono-kun...

132
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
He's personally...

133
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,340
What have you done to her "personally"?

134
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,610
You brute!

135
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,380
Dad! Hanazono-kun is nothing like that!

136
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,970
Fujiko, be quiet!

137
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,770
Th-This is all a mistake. I...

138
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,310
You piece of trash!

139
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,680
Please calm down, Father!

140
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,060
You have no right to call me "Father"!

141
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,150
Dad!

142
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,320
Everyone, calm down!

143
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm supposed to calm down?!

144
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,100
Dad! Hanazono-kun was just teaching me judo.

145
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,650
I don't want to hear about judo!

146
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,130
But we have the semi-finals next!

147
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,880
Um...

148
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Anyway, I'm gonna make this man pay!

149
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,590
Dad, stop it!

150
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,150
Kyonkyon!

151
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,640
Hold on, Kyonkyon!

152
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,030
Huh? Was she so scared she stopped breathing?

153
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,530
That's dumb.

154
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,190
You're making this frail girl do judo? How awful!

155
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,510
Mom!


156
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,120
Why don't you quit judo with Fujiko, okay?

157
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,600
It's for the best. You should take care of yourself.

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,850
Mom, Dad!

159
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,400
Oh yeah, where's Marilyn?

160
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,720
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her for a while.

161
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,370
And the semis are about to start.

162
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:17,330
Do you understand, Sayaka-san?
 You have to watch out for that tall girl.

163
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,510
Kazamatsuri-san, what did you see in Inokuma Yawara's performance today?

164
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,230
W-Well, you know she's in top form, as always.

165
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,190
Top form? Splendid.

166
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,980
I wouldn't be happy about defeating her if she wasn't.

167
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,780
Sayaka-san.

168
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,750
Next is the first match of the semi-finals,

169
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,790
between MWJC and Seishin Women's School.

170
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,750
I need to pretty myself up because I'll be on TV.



171
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,570
I can't find her anywhere!

172
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,440
No way! We're up now!

173
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,520
Where did you go, Marilyn?

174
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,260
Did she leave us?

175
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,070
She can't! If she did, we'll have to forfeit!

176
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,270
Geez, she's such a pain in the butt!
She can't! If she did, we'll have to forfeit!

177
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,710
Geez, she's such a pain in the butt!

178
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,910
Shoot, what'll we do?

179
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,610
Ah, screw it! I'll go look for her again!

180
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,710
Um...

181
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,930
Just listen to those loud cheers!

182
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,650
The rematch between Inokuma Yawara and Honami Sayaka has finally arrived!

183
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,040
Oh?

184
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,750
Kyon... kyon?

185
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,060
Honey!

186
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,750
Th-That tiny girl!

187
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,290
MWJC has actually changed their line-up!

188
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,720
Okay, according to the sheets, their lead player is...

189
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:41,830

Okay, according to the sheets, their lead player is...

190
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:41,930
Okay, according to the sheets, their lead player is...

191
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,930
Hikage... Hikage Kyoko.

192
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,710
And she weighs 36 kilos?

193
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,850
W-Will she be all right?

194
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,220
Kyonkyon, you're walking like a palace guard. Relax, relax!

195
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,020
O-Okay.

199
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,970
Thirty-six kilos?

200
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,570
Whoa, will she be all right?

201
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,500
Can she even do judo?

202
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,830
I bet a light breeze could knock her down.

203
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,890
They're making her compete. How horrible!

204
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,720
They're monsters! Monsters, I say!

205
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,020
And Fujiko is part of that judo team?!

206
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,340
Honey!

207
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,000
Kyonkyon?

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,430
Are you nuts? She can't do it!

209
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,720
Now here come the heiresses! Seishin Women's School is entering the ring!

210
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,440
Up till now, Honami Sayaka has been winning all the matches herself.

211
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,720
Honami aside, none of the others on that slapdash judo team really matter.

212
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,450
The other four are just there to add to the headcountâ€”

213
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,950
Hey!

214
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,080
Think before you speak! They're all daughters of our sponsors!

215
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,060
Bow!

216
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,000
We finally get to settle old scores.

217
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,510
Kazamatsuri-san.





218
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,590
What are you grinning for, Kazamatsuri-san?

219
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,860
S-Sayaka-san, you're facing that Ito girl and Yawara-san.

220
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,150
That means it's going to be a two-on-one battle.

221
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,140
It's one-on-one.

222
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,470
Sayaka-san!

223
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,790
I won't let anyone get in the way of my rematch with Inokuma Yawara.

224
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,840
Um...

225
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,480
U-Um...


226
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,200
I-I'll go in place of Marilyn-san!

227
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,470
More than anything else, I want to be useful to the team.

228
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,970
U-Um...

229
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,060
I know I'm saying this only after I offered to fill in.

230
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,480
If I lose, I'm sorry.

231
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,980
Kyonkyon...

232
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:10,640
But... after seeing you guys give it your all, I couldn't bear to stay on the sidelines.

233
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,660
So that's why I...

234
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,450
It's all right, Kyonkyon!

235
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,470
We'll pull through!

236
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,500
Kyonkyon!



237
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,040
Come on, get up. Let's practice before the match.

238
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,380
Inokuma-san.

239
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,870
One, two, three.

240
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,340
No, you need to pull me in more.

241
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,470
One...

242
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,110
Say it louder!

243
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,580
One, two...

244
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,970
Faster! One, two, three!

245
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,930
One, two, three!

246
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,190
First players, forward!

247
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,110
There, perfect.

248
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,520
Don't forget that trick. I know you'll win.

249
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,490
Okay.

250
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,190
Now then...

251
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,610
Bow!

252
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,320
Hey, she gonna be all right?

253
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,040
Don't hurt yourself, little girl!

254
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,740
I can win against her, despite the fact I've been nothing but a burden to Sayaka-san.

255
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,550
Actually, don't you think Kyonkyon's looking healthier?

256
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,590
She hasn't been staying in because of colds.

257
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,840
She can raise her voice as well.

258
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
Hang in there, Kyonkyon!

259
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,640
There's nothing to be scared of!

260
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,900
Gotoda-san, you can win against her!

261
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,190
Let's go!

262
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,510
You can do it, Kyonkyon.

263
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,490
Hajime!


264
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,140
There's a bizarre lack of intensity!

265
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,450
Are they even doing judo?

266
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,220
Gotoda-san! Just play the way I taught you!

267
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,680
You can do it against an opponent like that.

268
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,510
There's the Osoto Gari that
 Kazamatsuri-san taught me.

269
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,730
And all the other things he taught me... in the bedroom.

270
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,890
One, two, three...

271
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,830
One, two, three...

272
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,810
One, two, three... One, two, three...

273
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,440
Sorry, I guess I was late!

274
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,860
Hey, where'd you run off to?

275
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,570
Oh no, what about my turn?

276
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,360
It began ages ago!

277
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,840
No way! I spent all that time primping myself.

278
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,400
Geez, what'll you do if Kyonkyon gets hurt?

279
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,080
What the heck? So I'm the one who should get hurt?

280
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,830
Here goes the Osoto Gari.

281
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,270
She's fending it off!

282
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,510
Wow, Kyonkyon!

283
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,780
Gotoda-san, do that again!

284
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,760
You can do that Osoto Gari!

285
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,140
Calm down. Calm down.

286
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,750
Just do what Inokuma-san taught you.

287
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,150
One...

288
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:46,860
Two!

289
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,400
Three!

290
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,320
Ippon! Done!

291
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,340
You did it!

292
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,250
Looking good, little girl!

293
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,340
You did great!

294
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:18,630
What a shocker! What a stunning Deashi Barai!

295
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,810
Um. Did I... win?

296
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:24,850
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!
Um. Did I... win?

297
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,810
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

298
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,570
Aw, there you go again!

299
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,730
She actually did it!

300
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,480
Would you look at that.
 The soft commands the strong.

301
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,750
What about my turn?

302
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,130
Honey, that little girl is really doing her best!

303
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,590
Yes...

304
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,000
That's another matter entirely!

305
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,470
Fujiko is cheering on that violence loudly!

306
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,370
Anyway, I'm putting an end to her judo!

307
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,620
Well, yeah, so you say...

308
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,200
It's a draw!

309
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,950
Since neither player made a winning move, it's been declared a draw!

310
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,140
I've had my fill of this pointless opening act.

311
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,430
Inokuma Yawara, hurry up and face me.

312
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,430
Just leave it to us, Kyonkyon. We won't waste your efforts.

313
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,440
Inokuma Yawara!


314
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
Masaru, you big jerk!

315
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,530
Tetsuya, you big jerk!

316
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,590
Minamida defeats two!

317
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,650
Hikage Kyoko's gutsy performance must have triggered something inside her!

318
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,840
She took care of Vice Captain Konoike in the blink of an eye!

319
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,010
Yay!

320
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,390
And here she is, finally!

321
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,080
Seishin Women's School Captainâ€” no, I mean Queen, Honami Sayaka!

322
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,930
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!
Seishin Women's School Captainâ€” no, I mean Queen, Honami Sayaka!

323
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,420
Just listen to those loud cheers!
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

324
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,510
Honami Sayaka has led the newly formed Seishin Women's School team
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

325
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,180
Honami Sayaka has led the newly formed Seishin Women's School team

326
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,350
all the way to the semis just by dint of her own talents!

327
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,310
She's glaring at us!

328
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,990
Hey, time out!

329
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,820
It's like you're looking to fight Yawara-chan without even thinking about beating me.

330
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,050
I didn't train for three damn months for nothing, you know!

331
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,580
Hey, who are you looking at?! I'm the one you're facing!

332
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,080
You're in the way.

333
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,280
Wh-What the...

334
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,340
Hey, get back! You haven't bowed yet!

335
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,930
Bow!

336
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,250
Hajime!



337
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,930
You little!

338
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,960
Ippon! Done!

339
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,360
She's too strong!

340
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,040
Honami Sayaka quickly scores an Uchi Mata Ippon!

341
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,530
Inokuma-san! She's just too powerful!

342
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,030
A-And I'm next!

343
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,290
So what do you think of Honami, Saito-san?


344
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,150
She's definitely gotten stronger.

345
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,790
She gets her tenacity from her desire to defeat Inokuma.

346
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,480
Just great!

347
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,510
D-Don't tell me that milady has lost?

348
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,050
No, I meant...

349
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,290
Tastes great.

350
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,640
Another Uchi Mata!

351
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,610
You're in the way.

352
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,570
It's... It's my turn!

353
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,500
Hey, hey, honey! Fujiko's up now!

354
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,220
And she's taking on that powerful girl!

355
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,320
I knew I should've taken her home last time!

356
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,760
Keep fighting, Fujiko-san! I'm here for you!

357
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
You don't need to be there for her!

358
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Sayaka-san...

359
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,800
Are you clear?

360
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,270
You should really watch out for Ito Fujiko,

361
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,660
especially her Ouchi Gari.


362
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,780
Just one more before I face Inokuma Yawara.

363
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,820
Listen to me, Sayaka-san!

364
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,450
Soon we'll settle everything!

365
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,270
Sayaka-san!

366
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,400
Wh-What should I do, Inokuma-san? She scares me!

367
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,600
She scares me way more than Todo-san!

368
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,170
Inokuma-san, did you do something to her?

369
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,280
Her look says it's personal!

370
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,420
I-I didn't do anything.

371
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,390
MWJC Vice Captain, come forward!

372
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,090
Good luck, Fujiko-san!

373
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,730
Fight her!

374
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,810
S-Sorry if I lose in an instant!

375
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,730
F-Fujiko!

376
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,730
Keep fighting, Fujiko-san!

377
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,820
Just one more.

378
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,360
Sayaka-san...

379
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,830
News scroll: This time next week, we'll be airing "Extreme Religion Time! Meditation Mandrill vs. Meditation Monkey"

380
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,160
Bow!

381
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,800
The Barcelona Olympics in 425 Days

382
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,270
Kyonkyon's Deashi Barai was so awesome!

383
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,560
Hey, you saw it too, right, Grandpa?

384
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,150
Why are you getting excited?

385
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,460
The match between Beanpole and Miss Sayaka is about to begin!

386
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,900
Fujiko-san, good luck!

387
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,260
Miss, you may have thought Yawara was your only worthy opponent,

388
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,830
but are you even gonna reach her?

389
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,120
Yawara!

390
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,790
Get Out of My Way!

391
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,790
You'll get my Tsurikomi Goshi if you don't watch!

392
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,980
<b>Get Out of My Way!
You'll get my Tsurikomi Goshi if you don't watch!</b>

393
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,750
<b>Get Out of My Way!</b>

394
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,810
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

395
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:47,150
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru

396
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,660
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.
hitonami no kousaten senaka osarenagara

397
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:03,920
We climb an endless hill, just you and me.
sakamichi wo doko made mo anata to aruita

398
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:13,340
I want to say "I love you" to the one I truly want,
naze hoshii mono wo "daisuki" to

399
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,520
But why can I not? I really don't know.
koe ni dashite ienai no?

400
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,270
You're standing here by my side.
ima anata ga iru

401
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:36,490
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.
tada sore dake de yasuragu kimochi

402
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,670
"Please don't let go of the hand you're holding,"
"tsunaideru sono yubi wo hanasanaide..."

403
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:51,050
I say as I look for your smile.
