I've loved him.

I've always been waiting.

I know it's what I want the most.

Hey, Kamuda!

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,040
What the...

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,670
Oh, it's you, Matsuda-san.

28
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,170
You seem pleased. What's the good news?

29
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,800
"Inokuma Yawara to appear at the Ajisai Cup Intermural Women's Tournament!"

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,930
Will that work?

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,060
Huh?

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,640
It's gonna be tomorrow's front page headline.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,850
So Yawara-san has returned to judo?

34
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,560
Yep!

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,730
That's great to hear.

36
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,110
You've been worrying about her a lot.

37
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,200
Inokuma... Yawara.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,160
Excuse me, may we have another match?

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,580
Yawara-san certainly did challenge Tsukushi U to another match.

40
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,170
Yawara-san, you've really returned to judo, haven't you?

41
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,670
And with the chief in a good mood as well,
 things are going your way, huh?

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,800
The chief?


43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,600
He's always inviting me for drinks, though you know I can't deal with him.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,190
But a while ago, he was complaining about stomach problems from stress.

45
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,860
You mean he got diarrhea from overeating.

46
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,860
No one looks like that when they're stressed.

47
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,070
Geez, you could at least wash your hands!

48
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,740
Whoops, and you just did your hair too.

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,620
You see, this is why you can't get a girl.

50
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,240
Hell, the chief himself never washes his hands, even after a dump!

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,620
Gross!

52
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,920
Damn you, Matsuda!




53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,630
Not again...

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,770
Fujiko, Love, and Judo

55
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,440
I have to say, you were spectacular.

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,520
That's enough, Hanazono-san!

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,440
No, let me say it again, Fujiko-san!

58
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,200
Your deadly Swan Lake technique.

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,660
To think that you perfected that masterful Ouchi Gari in such a short time...

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,700
It was... simply spectacular.

61
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,000
Look, Hanazono-san...


62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,710
Hello?

63
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,960
Why are you two having all the fun?

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,550
Yes, I'll admit that Fujiko-san's Swan Lake move was spectacular,

65
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,470
but I've got one of them too, you know.

66
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,470
That's right. Paddy-field had her...

67
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,730
Takeshi, you jerk!

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,270
A.K.A. "Send Your Exes to Hell."


69
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,980
Thirteen was quite the unlucky number for them!

70
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,940
A-And there was Yoshinagawa-san's deadly Konaki-jiji!

71
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,030
Diet!

72
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,410
Since I lost so much weight during the match, it should be all right to eat this.



73
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,000
However, everyone knows that I was the biggest standout of the match.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,660
Only because you're that much of a slut.

75
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,420
Feeling jealous already, Paddy-field?

76
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,040
What are you getting at?

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,750
Um...

78
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,510
Um, I know I lost today,


79
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,510
but I feel I can do anything if I have the will, just like Inokuma-san told me.

80
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,270
So, um, it will be my pleasure to work with you.

81
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,440
Oh please, the pleasure is all mine, Kyonkyon.

82
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,020
Fujiko-san.


83
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,110
I didn't know how it would turn out at first,

84
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,030
but now, our team will be participating in a real tournament.

85
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:11,200
And it's all thanks to me, the eminent coach, right, Beanpole?

86
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,500
However, the training's going to become even more strenuous.



87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,500
That's because we'll be facing a gaggle of top-tier teams like Tsukushi U.

88
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,470
You're all gonna have to tighten up those fundoshi strings and step up.

89
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,220
Or rather, the waistbands on our panties.

90
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,680
Well, I guess those modern drawers aren't any different from a fundoshi anyway.





91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,980
You're so informed, old man.

92
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Grandpa, honestly.

93
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:42,940
Everyone! As long as I, Hanazono Kaoru, work together with Master Jigoro,

94
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,650
MJWC's judo team will remain an undying institution.

95
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,240
I'll be fine on my own!

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,700
Hanazono-san is right!

97
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,290
Let's raise our glasses again to MJWC's new departure,

98
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,630
and to Inokuma Yawara-san's return to judo! Cheers!

99
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,840
Cheers!

100
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,220
Now then, Yawara, we need to go home and practice!

101
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,510
Grandpa, I haven't eaten anything yet!

102
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,220
What are you saying? My stomach's full already!


103
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,230
Sir, shouldn't you let Inokuma-san rest today?

104
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,230
Yeah, don't be so hard on her, gramps!

105
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,480
I also ask you to let her rest, Master Jigoro!

106
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,240
You're just messing around because you scrapped a little in your first match.

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Then after this, you plan to have a wild, drunken party at a filthy discotheque, right?

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,710
A drunken party?



109
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,750
I see what you're up to!

110
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm afraid I can't do that.

111
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
If you've got time for all that, then train!

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,750
Grandpa!

113
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,630
Inokuma-san!

114
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,420
Inokuma!

115
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,220
Hanazono!

116
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,680
Yes, sir!

117
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,180
You take care of everything, including the bill!

118
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,470
Th-The bill?

119
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,190
We're going this way.

120
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,900
See you guys at the gym tomorrow!

121
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,690
Take care!

122
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,780
Oh, my body's all hurt and swollen!

123
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,240
But you didn't do a damn thing!

124
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,040
That was great. I had a lot of fun.

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,170
Me too!

126
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,140
I-I'm looking forward to the Ajisai Cup.

127
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,890
Inokuma is going to be there, and she's going to be the champ.

128
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,650
I guarantee that!

129
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,320
Hanazono-san.

130
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,230
Would you care to sit down?

131
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,400
S-Sure!

132
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,450
Did I do the right thing?

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,910
I wonder if I did something horrible to Inokuma-san?

134
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,380
I wonder if she really does have an issue doing judo with us?

135
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,710
No, she doesn't!

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,550
I haven't seen...

137
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,350
that expression on Inokuma's face in a long time.

138
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,890
That twinkle in her eyes showed that she never really wanted to quit judo.

139
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,690
It's because you and the others struggled and did your best out there.

140
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,490
No matter what happens,
 I won't let her give up judo.

141
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,700
No, she's not someone who would give up judo.

142
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,830
That's what I believe.



143
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,370
You're right.

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,630
You must know a whole lot about Inokuma-san.

145
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,340
Yes. She's a fine judoka and a fine woman.

146
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,140
Yes, you're right.

147
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,890
But I only see Inokuma as someone I admire!

148
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,110
I swear I never had any impure thoughts about her!

149
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,030
Um, I...

150
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,290
Oh, never mind.

151
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,210
I said something to Inokuma-san one time.

152
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:35,010
I told her that judo burns from the bottom of her heart.

153
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,010
But after that match, I also realized...

154
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,260
that I must feel the same way too!

155
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm really glad I met Inokuma-san and all the team members.

156
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,030
I want to keep playing judo with all of them.

157
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,530
Fujiko-san!



158
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Please let me, Hanazono Kaoru, humbly support you!

159
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,290
We at Ebitendo Sports College also have our matches, so I can't keep coaching you,

160
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,960
but I'll definitely attend your upcoming tournament!

161
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,460
Thank you, Hanazono-san!

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,460
I'm really glad I'm doing judo!

163
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,970
Otherwise, I wouldn't have met someone like you!

164
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,050
H-Hanazono-san!

165
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,890
Yes, Fujiko-san?

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,430
Shut the hell up!

167
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,060
For God's sake, cut that out! Sheesh!

168
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,940
Oh, right.

169
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,570
We're sorry.
We're sorry.

170
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,200
Th-Thanks.

171
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,950
Yeah.

172
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,130
Look, you can leave me here.

173
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,630
Thanks for carrying my bag for me.

174
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,630
U-Um, Fujiko-san?

175
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,140
Yes?

176
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,680
D-Do you...

177
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,890
Do you feel cold?

178
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,810
But my apartment's right there!

179
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,890
I can't let you catch a cold!

180
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,600
But it's right in front of us!

181
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,580
G-Good night!

Hanazono...

186
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,620
I hate to say it, but I can't beat you!

187
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,580
You should be the captain at our next match!

188
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,500
Right, guys?

189
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,080
Yeah!

190
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,340
Please accept, Hanazono.


191
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,300
Leave everything to me, Senpai.

192
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,340
Congratulations, Hanazono-kun!

193
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,640
Matsuda-san!

194
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,510
Can I get an exclusive interview?

195
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,520
Oh, really? Aw, shucks.

196
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,600
Hanazono-san?

197
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,650
Fujiko-san!

198
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,070
What brings you here?

199
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
Don't worry about that.

200
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,780
What matters is that you're the captain! That's wonderful!

201
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,790
Thank you, Fujiko-san!

202
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,330
It's wonderful, really wonderful.

203
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,550
It... It looks like she...

204
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,550
w-wants me to kiss her!

205
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,840
F-Fujiko-san!

206
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,020
I, Hanazono Kaoru, will kiss you.

207
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,110
Ow!


208
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,290
Are you <i>that</i> hot for my leg?

209
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,380
Wash these too!

210
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,050
Me?

211
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,050
Fujiko-san!

212
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,140
Fujiko-san, geez!

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,140
They opened the gym. We're supposed to get the mats.

214
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,150
Why were you grinning?

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,610
Um, it's nothing.

216
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,740
So what are you gonna wear at the group date?

217
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,910
Oh, I found these totally cute clothes in Shibuya.


218
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,780
The new freshmen act so much like college girls

219
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,540
that you can't tell them apart from the second years!

220
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,000
They're always talking about group dates and dance parties during class.

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,380
There just aren't a lot of college girls into judo nowadays.

222
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,510
Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.

223
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,090
Inokuma-san?

224
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,510
Huh?

225
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,060
Are you in love right now?

226
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,560
Huh?



227
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,520
Forget what I just said!

228
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,530
Oh yeah, what did you guys do last night?

229
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,030
We made up for your absence by eating and going nuts!

230
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,080
Lucky! I had to practice with my grandpa.

231
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,290
Hey, do you know what Hanazono-kun did?

232
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,670
After a second huge helping of hamburger steak and rice,

233
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,800
he ate spaghetti and a chocolate parfait!

234
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,760
And he said that wasn't enough, didn't he?

235
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,050
Yes. Right on the money.

236
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,430
He was like that back in high school.

237
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,140
He'd drink twenty bottles of milk after practice without breaking a sweat!

238
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,150
Oh yeah, there was that all-you-can-eat pizza thing.

239
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,950
That's right. You two have been together since high school, so you know a lot about him.

240
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,660
I want to know more about him.

241
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Oh, never mind.

242
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,500
G-Good night!

243
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,500
Fujiko-san!

244
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,260
Hey, Fujiko-san!

245
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,550
What's the matter?

246
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,300
Sorry.

247
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,770
You've been acting weird all morning.

248
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,350
Say, don't you think the others are late?

249
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,940
Yeah, those girls are late.

251
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,740
Don't you dare relax!

252
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,460
There are only two months till the Ajisai Cup Intermural Women's Tournament!

253
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,250
Ogaki! You're the first one up!

254
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,540
You'd better take care of those four newbies from MWJC!

255
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,590
All of you are national champs!

256
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,800
Even an Inokuma can't defeat five top players!

257
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:43,810
You'll hand Inokuma her first loss!

258
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,060
I hope.




259
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,320
What happened to them?

260
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,820
They suffered through a lot yesterday.

261
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Their aches and pains must've kept them in bed.

262
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,790
You're right. They should be coming soon.

263
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,040
I hope.

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,340
What's this? You need to put up more of a fight!

265
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,460
This doesn't amount to any sort of training!

266
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,470
Do you know why a person like me would condescend to working up a sweat?

267
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,470
It's so I can defeat that pest, Inokuma Yawara.

268
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,470
Now, who's next?



269
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,850
Yes, ma'am!

270
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,230
She's desperate.

271
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,860
Yawara-san means even more to her now.

272
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,270
Another reason is that

273
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,780
Yawara-san's father, Mr. Inokuma Kojiro, is still leaning toward being her coach.

274
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,200
B-Big news!

275
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,990
What is it, Tokunaga-san?

276
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,120
H-Here, read this.

277
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,750


278
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,420
Yawara-san?


279
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,210
It's like seeing a long sought-after oasis!

280
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,920
Don't look at the picture. Read the headline!

281
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,680
The Ajisai Cup? She's going to appear in the Intermural Women's Tournament?

282
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,430
Inokuma is aiming for the national championship at the tournament?

283
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,900
So she's avoiding a face-off with me in order to show off at that tournament?

284
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Darn! She's always thinking of new ways to show me up!

285
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,410
Tokunaga, please enter me into that tournament immediately.

286
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,710
But, milady...

287
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,950
Hold on, Sayaka-san!
But, milady...

288
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,410
Your judo club at Seishin Women's School doesn't have any members!

289
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,920
People will join if I tell them to.

290
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,670
Do you think a ritzy girls school like Seishin has any good judo players?





291
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,070
Even if the other members are useless,

292
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,930
I'll simply keep winning in that elimination tournament.

293
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,930
Then I'll finally have my match against Inokuma Yawara.

294
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,690
I can hardly wait.

295
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,190
This is nuts.

296
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,650
If only Inokuma Kojiro was coaching her now...

297
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,240
Box: Chicken Nuggets

298
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,410
Here, girl! Here, girl!
Box: Chicken Nuggets

299
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,240
Here! Here!
Box: Chicken Nuggets

300
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,780
Here! Here!

301
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,340
Nobody's coming.

302
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,300
Don't worry! We were all really into it yesterday, right?

303
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,060
I guess it's because I lost yesterday.

304
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,850
It's not your fault!


305
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,810
But...

306
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,820
a normal girl wouldn't want to play judo.

307
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,780
No, you're wrong!

308
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,820
Judo is a very glamorous sport!

309
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,820
Didn't you see how disappointed we were after we lost that match?

310
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,750
Why don't we three start practicing?

311
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,970
Paddy-field!




312
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,760
When I said I wanted to see him, he said, "Sure."

313
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,930
But then that Katsuo...

314
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,480
He shot me down! That makes him the fourteenth!

315
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,940
I was so pissed I threw him straight to the ground!

316
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,450
Was that what happened?

317
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,120
We'll make you stronger, so you can throw more people around!

318
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,120
Yoshinagawa-san!

319
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,000
Look at me!

320
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,050
I lost three kilos at the match!

321
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,760
I must look positively emaciated!

322
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,630
You went through a lot yesterday!

323
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,680
I would've lost five kilos if I hadn't eaten afterwards.

324
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,140
All right, I'm gonna keep practicing judo and lose more weight!

325
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,640
Hi!



326
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,690
Everyone's here!

327
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,690
Oh, my God! Have you seen the papers?

328
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,700
When I got on the train, all the old men were staring at me,

329
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,950
but they weren't perving over me like they usually do.

330
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,200
It was like they were ogling a star!

331
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,170
It had me wondering, but it turns out I'm a celebrity.

332
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,800
Take a look.

333
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,390
What can I say? A fine showing like mine <i>would</i> make the papers!

334
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,770
Now there's no way I'm quitting judo.

335
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,810
What do you mean, "a fine showing"?

336
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,940
My fine showing. Mine.

337
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
You saw my picture in the paper, didn't you?

338
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,020
What are you, some kind of ghost?

339
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,360
This doesn't even count!

340
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,700
You're always jealous of me, Paddy-field!

341
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,990
What are you getting at?

342
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,240
Inokuma-san.

343
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,080
Fujiko-san.

344
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,080
See, everybody came.

345
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,500
Judo is a really great sport.



346
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,340
Mm-hmm.

347
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,050
Hey!

348
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,550
It's way past practice time. Why are you standing around gabbing?!

349
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,260
When it comes to a great judoka like me,

350
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,310
there are no shortcuts to excellence, only practice, practice, practice!

351
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,730
Ah, man...

352
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,400
Fine. Let's get on with it.

353
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,270
Wow, I'm a celebrity.

354
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:29,530
All right, Yawara, Beanpole, quit lazing about and get started!

355
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,450
Yes.

356
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,280
Yes, sir!
Yes.

357
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,540
Let's give it our all for the Ajisai Cup!

358
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,870
Judo is youth!

359
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,750
Judo is laundry.

360
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,850
The Barcelona Olympics in 460 Days

361
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,430
Yawara! Where's your fire?!

362
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,270
Even that Beanpole is training through blood, sweat, and tears!

363
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,270
Is that so?

364
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,230
But I have to admit, Fujiko-san is really into it.

365
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,360
According to Matsuda, powerful players you've never heard of

366
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,700
are coming from all over the country for a chance to beat you in the tournament.

367
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,830
Is that true?

368
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,740
Yawara!

369
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,790
Everybody Wants to Beat Yawara!

370
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,580
<b>Everybody Wants to Beat Yawara!
Everybody Wants to Beat Yawara!</b>

371
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,560
You'll get my Tomoe Nage if you don't watch!
<b>Everybody Wants to Beat Yawara!</b>

372
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,750
<b>Everybody Wants to Beat Yawara!</b>

373
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,680
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

374
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:46,980
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru

375
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:54,530
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.
hitonami no kousaten senaka osarenagara

376
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:03,750
We climb an endless hill, just you and me.
sakamichi wo doko made mo anata to aruita

377
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,180
I want to say "I love you" to the one I truly want,
naze hoshii mono wo "daisuki" to

378
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:20,430
But why can I not? I really don't know.
koe ni dashite ienai no?

379
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,150
You're standing here by my side.
ima anata ga iru

380
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:36,370
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.
tada sore dake de yasuragu kimochi

381
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:43,500
"Please don't let go of the hand you're holding,"
"tsunaideru sono yubi wo hanasanaide..."

382
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,880
I say as I look for your smile.
egao wo sagashite
