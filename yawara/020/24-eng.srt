Maybe I should.. try it.

I can't possibly break a promise with Jody, who came all the way from Canada just to fight me.

You sure?

16
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,470
So, you're not going to study for the
entrance exams and enter Saikai 
College as a scholarship athlete?

17
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,690
I'll study for the exams, too.

18
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,730
I'll study and do the tournaments for Jody.

19
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,940
I think I should try to do everything I want to do.

No buts or schmuts!

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,110
Explain to me why your performance in 
the past few tournaments sucked!

27

I won four straight tournaments.

28

Memo
Your first tournament was so-so,
but in the second tournament, you 
actually fell asleep during a match.

32
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,750
Your first tournament was so-so,
but in the second tournament, you 
actually fell asleep during a match.

33
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,670
And in the third and fourth tournaments, the match times grew longer and longer.

34
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,700
In the last tournament's final round, it almost dragged on to a post-round decision...

35
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,590
...but you did a wimpy ippon zeoi and 
barely won with an ippon victory.

36
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,650
But, at least I won them, right?

37
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,860
At least?

38
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,670
At least you won?

39
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,710
That's the problem!


40
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:38,370
When I won 5 straight National Championships in a row, my match times were less than a blink.



41
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,480
And people in the audience were so paralyzed with fear that they're still like that to this day.

42
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,130
I know.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,760
You're great, Grandpa.

44
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,310
But I'm not as great as you!

45
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,450
But I'm not as great as you!
Shut up!

46
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,390
Shut up!

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,940
My textbooks!

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,880
You went through my room again, didn't you?

49
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,460
Geez!

50
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,680
Give them back!

51
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,750
No.

52
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,280
It's useless to waste your time studying without sleeping all night long.

53
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,510
Useless?


54
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,120
What's useless about my exam studies?


55
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,630
Your already set to enroll into Saikai College.

56
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,620
I'm not going there!


57
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,100
Look, don't you ever do so poorly 
in any more tournaments.

58
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,700
I'll keep these textbooks.

59
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,630
Give them back to me!

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,290
Not fair!

61
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,810
Geez, I have to use up my month's
allowance for these.

62
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,460
And, I'm the one trying to budget
the family expenses, too.

63
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,520
Geez!

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,320
Welcome.

65
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,660
Me?

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,060
Yes, I've been worried about you.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,560
But, you weren't home when I dropped by.

68
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,990
I'm so glad I bumped into you at that bookstore.

69
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,380
Why were you worried about me?

70
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,570
Yawara-san, in the past few matches, 
you've been lacking the usual finesse.

71
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,720
In fact, it's getting worse.

72
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,420
What's going on?

73
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,400
Yes?

74
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,580
Please bring a cake.

75
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,770
Give me a Charlotte Boire.

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,660
Oh, that's all?

77
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,080
Just studying for exams?

78
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,100
It's no laughing matter.

79
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,510
Well, please eat.

81
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,710
I will, thank you.

82
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,880
I'm staring, aren't I?

83
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,900
You're probably uncomfortable
with me watching you.

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,860
Not really..

85
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,850
I thought that perhaps you didn't feel well, but..

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,660
..I see, you're trying to get into Mitsuba

That's a great school.

No, I know a few good professors there.

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,660
They're all great people.

91
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,030
But, I don't think I can study at home anymore.

stubborn mind on decisions.

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,430
I'll be your tutor.

95
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,640
I'll tutor you at my condo.

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,140
B.. but, I can't..

Incredible!

102
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,090
She made it to finals, just like that!

103
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,920
Coach Yuutenji, I didn't know 
she was this great!

104
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,410
President, then we have no problems 
with her scholarship appointment?

105
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,370
Not even a problem!

Isn't Yawara-san on a roll today?

110
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:45,970
Yeah.

111
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,010
I've heard that she hasn't been
doing too well these days...

112
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,520
...but she is absolutely fabulous today!

113
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,820
Apparently, she seems to have gotten out
of the slump and doing rather well.

114
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,500
This is great! Even the president is over-joyed!

115

Of course he is.

Please enroll Yawara-san into our college.

Leave it to me, President.

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,900
What are you doing?

122
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,810
Get him the ichigo daifuku, pronto. 
[ichigo daifuku -- strawberry rice cakes]

She must have recovered 
from that temporary slump.

But, I'm sure she hasn't given up her studies.

Why is she doing so well then?

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,270
Thanks for waiting, Yawara-san.

132
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,060
Yes.

He's taking her to his condo!

139
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
You're going right into a 
dangerous trap, Yawara-san!

140
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,700
Yes. It isn't "have been."

141
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,510
Since it's a past subjunctive verb,
it's "had been".

142
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,390
Okay.

143
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,760
Then, what is this one?

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,700
Umm, would I use "have been"?

145
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,360
Yes.

146
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,420
You're doing great, Yawara-san.

147
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,600
Something wrong?

148
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,920
No, nothing.

149
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,940
Are you tired? Maybe we should take a break?

150
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,610
No, I'm okay.


151
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,490
But, Kazamatsuri-san, you're so gifted.

152
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,230
You're good at judo and you're so smart.

153
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,490
Well, I am gifted.. no, not that gifted.

154
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,320
Rather, I'm amazed at you, Yawara-san, trying to do judo and exam studying at the same time.

155
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,380
I'm not that great..

156
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,900
Have more confidence in yourself.

157
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,770
You can accomplish anything you set 
your mind to. Really. I assure you.

M.. Matsuda-san, I can't breathe!

162
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,490
M.. Matsuda-san, I can't breathe!

163
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,970
Damn, that Kazamatsuri!

164
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,150
Don't tell me...

165
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,430
Studs are so lucky.

166
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,640
You idiot!

167
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,150
Don't think so nasty!

168
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,860
You were thinking like that, too, Matsuda-san.

169
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,370
Th.. there she is!

170
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,300
Wait up, Matsuda-san!

171
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,150
Thank you very much for tutoring me 
and giving me a ride home.

172
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:52,960
No problem.

173
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,190
I'll see you tomorrow then.

174
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,330
Yes.

175
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,630
Goodnight.

176
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,400
Eii, that Yawara.

177
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,480
What is she doing all this time.. huh?

178
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,590
I'm home.

179
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,030
You stupid fool! What time do you think --

180
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,930
You stupid fool! What time do you think --
I'm sorry I'm back this late.

181
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,610
I'm sorry I'm back this late.

182
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,240
You're eating instant noodles again?

183
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,460
I'll make you a really delicious meal now, okay?

184
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,780
Maybe I should make pork soup?

185
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,420
And maybe some age-dashi tofu, 
sawara teriyaki and...

186
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,030
Kimpira gobo, jya!

187
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,810
That was close.

188
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,700
Were you trying to crash into me?

189
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,180
You wouldn't be able to pay for the 
damages with your measly salary.

190
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,670
What did you do with Yawara-san?

191
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,260
Why was Yawara-san at your condo?

192
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,680
How pathetic. Are you jealous?

193
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,250
N.. no way!

194
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,600
As a newspaper reporter, I'm just 
concerned about her future!

195
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,590
That's what you say, but you have 
feelings for her, don't you?

196
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
Why don't you just admit it?

197
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,310
Just shut up!

198
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,790
You don't have a right to say that, 
since you and Hon'ami Sayaka are...

199
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,180
You're mistaken.

200
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,760
There's nothing going on between 
me and Sayaka-san.

201
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,290
Even if there was, it's none 
of your business anyway.

202
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,520
Excuse me.

203
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,240
Oh, really?

204
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,000
So I can tell Miss Sayaka about 
what happened tonight?

205
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,760
Wha -- w.. w.. wait..

206
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,480
Kazamatsuri-san.

207
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,730
Sayaka-san.

208
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,660
Do you have some time tomorrow night?

209
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,680
I found a wonderful Greek restaurant, so...

210
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,110
I'm sorry, but..

211
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,900
Aww...

212
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,410
Aww...
An old high school friend is dropping
by my place tomorrow.

213
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,430
An old high school friend is dropping
by my place tomorrow.

214
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,940
I.. it's a guy!

215
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,350
A guy friend, of course.

216
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,230
He's a pretty hideous guy, too.

217
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,820
Please, don't trouble me.

218
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,790
Sayaka-san is really possessive
in the first place.

219
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,820
Hmph.

220
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,950
I didn't do anything to Yawara-san.

221
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,950
I was just tutoring her.

222
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,460
Tutoring?

223
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,570
Yeah.

224
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,250
I was just trying to help her 
with her exam studies.

225
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,540
Oh, is that it? No wonder.

226
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,950
Of course. That's the only reason 
she'd go to your place anyway --

227
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,730
Wait! Either way, she's in danger!

228
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,190
Why do have such a happy face, Yawara?

229
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,420
No reason.

230
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,370
I know.

231
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,950
You were thinking about 
Kazamatsuri-san, weren't you?

232
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
No, I wasn't.

233
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,480
No, I wasn't.
You're so lucky, especially at this 
depressing time of exam studying....

234
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,870
You're so lucky, especially at this 
depressing time of exam studying....

235
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,150
No, no.

236
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,610
Don't hide it from us.

237
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,960
I'm not.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,840
Look at that relaxed smile.

239
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm so jealous!

240
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,460
Tell us the truth.

241
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,090
Tell us the truth.
Oww, oww.

242
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,130
Tell us the truth.

243
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,460
Kyoko, you look serious.

244
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,870
Hey!

245
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,330
Matsuda-san?

246
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,160
No, Matsuda-san.

247
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,280
It's a past conjunctive verb, so it's "had been."

248
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,860
R.. really? So it is!

249
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,590
You spelled it wrong, too.

250
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,630
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:40,770
I'm sorry.
And you call yourself a tutor? Liar.

252
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,810
And you call yourself a tutor? Liar.

253
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,130
Well, I guess high schools are
much tougher these days.

254
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,590
H.. hey, we should study geography.

255
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,060
That was one of my stronger subjects.

256
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,190
There aren't any geography questions
on college entrance exams.

257
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,070
O.. oh, that's right.

258
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,610
Read this part then.

259
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,020
As mat per fure in...

260
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,600
Your pronunciation is bad, too.

261
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,690
Oh, look at the time.

262
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,720
I'm going home.

263
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,450
Going home? But we just started.

264
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,910
Just started? You call this tutoring?


265
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm trying for Mitsuba College, and 
keeping a promise with Jody.

266
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,380
Don't drag me down like this.

267
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,930
H.. hey. I'll take you home.

268
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,840
No thank you.

269
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,160
Don't hold back.

270
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,230
I can bike you home really quickly.

271
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,880
I refuse to ride with a biker that 
dumps his bike into a river.

272
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,050
I'm never going to have you 
tutor me, ever! Goodbye!

273
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,650
H.. hey!

274
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,270
You suck, Matsuda Kousaku. Straighten up!

275
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,350
I will not get depressed over this!
[imitating the gesture of when 
the Masked Rider morphs]

276
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,690
Darn!

277
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,620
I apologize for being mean
just now. Excuse me.

278
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,040
Hey, what's "regret"?

279
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,690
How should I know?

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,410
Why don't you ask Kazamatsuri-san?

281
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,450
Why you --

282
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,680
You!

283
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,750
Ch.. Chief.

284
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,480
Matsuda, I thought you were unusually 
diligent, but what were you doing?

285
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,760
Oh, I am sorry.

286
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,470
You're gonna help out with the 
proofreading. All night!

287
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,450
Oh my God.

288
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,650
Don't "oh my god" me, you idiot!

289
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,740
Now get to work!

290
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:27,780
"But, it is often difficult to distinguish a person's true feeling," Tom Buchanan said to me.

291
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,120
That's perfect. You're excellent, Yawara-san.

292
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,120
No, you teach very well, Kazamatsuri-san.

293
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,900
No, you're very smart.

294
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,690
You won't have any problems 
getting into Mitsuba College.


295
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,080
I don't know.

296
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,960
But, Kazamatsuri-san, why are 
you so good with English?

297
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,630
Once, I was very fascinated by the works 
of a certain American poet.

298
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,280
I wanted to read the poems in the original language, so I really studied English.

299
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,180
Poems?

300
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,750
"We loved with a love that was more than love."

301
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,090
She was just a child. And so was I.

302
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,740
In this coastal kingdom, we loved 
each other regardless.

303
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,640
We loved each other more than love could.

304
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,030
Just a few lines from Edgar 
Allen Poe's "Anabel Lee".


305
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,870
Like this poem, I'm probably looking... 
for that single, eternal woman to love.

306
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:26,110
Or something like that. Was that 
a little pretentious?

307
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,870
Not really..

308
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,640
Yes?

309
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,640
Shin-chan. It's me!

310
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,360
Holy! M.. Mariko!

311
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,650
Last time was so good!

312
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,020
I've been thinking about you ever since then.

313
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,720
I.. I'm grateful for all your help!

314
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,570
Can I?

315
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,460
Oh sure.

316
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,130
Can I come over now?

317
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,690
Oh really?

318
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,590
NO!

319
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,070
I.. I'm bedridden with a really 
bad headache right now.

320
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,280
Maybe next time?

321
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,210
Umm, I'll..

322
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,200
Yes?

323
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,580
Make some tea.

324
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,510
Tea, huh?

325
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,810
Oh no!

326
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,060
The cup with the lipstick stain of White Lily College girl, Megumi, is still in the kitchen.

327
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,880
Hello? Shin-chan? Shin-chan?

328
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,990
Umm, Kazamatsuri-san's cup is...

329
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,500
..oh, is that it?

330
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,710
Hey, that's okay.

331
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,650
You must be tired from doing
judo and exam studying.


332
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,010
I'm actually very energized. I'm not tired at all.

333
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,830
No, no. Just sit there.

334
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,050
You're very nice, Kazamatsuri-san.


335
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,830
Well, you can't waste any time.

336
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,270
Just do these problems for now.

337
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,660
Yes?

338
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,050
Yukari!

339
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,420
You're there, right, Shinnosuke-san?

340
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,530
Let me in.

341
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:06,670
Let me in.
N.. no, not today. I have a cold.

342
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,290
N.. no, not today. I have a cold.

343
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,200
Oh my.

344
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,590
Then I'll make you all nice and warm!

345
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,630
N.. no, I don't want to pass this on to you.

346
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,230
I'll give you a call, okay?

347
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,580
Aww, I suppose.

348
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,500
Well, here you go.

349
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,420
I just took it off.

350
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,670
Think about me when you see that, okay?

351
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,420
Well, take care.

352
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,540
Are you all right?

353
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,390
I'm okay. Don't worry.

354
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,250
Just go back and study, okay? Okay?

355
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,120
Yes.

356
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,640
Hello?

357
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,470
Shin-chan, this is Mariko.

358
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,520
I thought I heard a girl's voice
in the background.

359
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,610
It's my little sister. My little sister.

360
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,950
Weren't you an only child, Shin-chan?

361
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,080
My dad had an illegitimate child. He's so bad!

362
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,570
Kazamatsuri-san, I'll go make some tea.

363
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,410
It's all right. Really.

364
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,690
You should do those problems..

365
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,500
I already did them.

366
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,360
And, I want to help you out, too, Kazamatsuri-san.


367
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,130
I appreciate the thought.

368
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,190
Come on, let's get back to studying.

369
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,740
You're an excellent student, Yawara-san.

370
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,480
Kazamatsuri-san!

371
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,700
Let's take your friend to eat out with us..

372
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,880
Hello? Shin-chan?

373
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,310
What's going on?

374
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,470
Hello? Shin-chan?

375
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,820
Shin-chan?

376
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,960
817 Days to the Barcelona Olympics


377
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,480
Why? Why is Sayaka-san..?

378
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,000
Are Sayaka-san and Kazamatsuri-san actually..?

379
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,220
Are Sayaka-san and Kazamatsuri-san actually..?
That Yawara.

380
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,910
That Yawara.

381
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,370
Thinking about that Kaza-MIDORI again, huh?

382
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,320
Come on, Yawara!

383
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,170
Hurry up, sit down and watch the TV!

384
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,920
Jodei's match is about to start!

385
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,970
What? Jody!

386
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,110
What? Jody!
Cheer her on!

387
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,450
Cheer her on!

388
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,120
Look at Jodei fight and settle down for once.

389
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,580
Next time, on "Yawara!" --

390
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,650
Love, Exam Studies, and Yawara's Feelings.

391
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,730
I'll do a sankaku jime on 
those who don't watch.
