1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,550
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,350
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,500
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,800
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,300
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,270
This is the first time I've ever had fun, too.

10
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,870
So, next time..

11
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,750
Next time?

12
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,460
When your arm is healed,
let's fight again, okay?

13
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,990
At a competition somewhere.

14
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,170
R.. really? Yawara?

15
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,080
Yes. I promise.

16
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:07,270
See You Again, Yawara

17
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,170
I should go.

18
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,050
What's wrong, Yawara?

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,400
You don't seem too happy.

20
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,610
It'll be lonely without you, Jody.

21
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,600
No, Yawara, we'll be able to meet 
again at a tournament next time.

22
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,700
Yeah, the whole world will be able 
to see the two of you fight.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,650
Yes.

24
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,010
And, we'll do our best then, too.

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,370
Promise, Yawara?

26
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,300
Jody, you'll do a match against the
Soviet team when you get back.

27
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,050
Is your injured arm all right?

28
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,440
No problem.

29
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,070
Jigoro-sensei's treatment is very good.

30
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,140
It'll heal completely in time.

31
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,850
Grandpa should've come to see you off, too.

32
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,690
He said he'd come by later, but...

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,910
I'm sorry, Jody.

34
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,370
Don't apologize.

35
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,840
I learned so much from Jigoro-sensei already.

36
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,020
He's the world's best sensei.

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,960
Yawara, I'm very envious of you.

38
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,750
Oh really?

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,500
Oh really?
We will now begin boarding for
flight 732 to Toronto at gate...

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,890
We will now begin boarding for
flight 732 to Toronto at gate...

41
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,380
We will now begin boarding for
flight 732 to Toronto at gate...
Hey, it's time.

42
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,580
We will now begin boarding for
flight 732 to Toronto at gate...

43
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,040
Well, Yawara and Matsuda, take care.

44
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,490
You too, Jody.

45
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,290
Good luck on your upcoming match.

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,310
Yawara, you need to keep your boyfriend 
under your thumb, okay?

47
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,210
Boyfriend?

48
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,100
Oh please!

49
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,860
A guy like him is not my boyfriend!

50
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:53,870
A guy like him is not my boyfriend!
What kind of guy am I, huh?

51
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,660
What kind of guy am I, huh?

52
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,240
Don't blush too much now.

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,180
There's a big difference in the outcomes of matches if you have or don't have a boyfriend.

54
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,830
Y.. you don't understand...

55
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,390
Matsuda, take care of Yawara.

56
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,130
Well, until we fight again, Yawara.

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,950
Jody..

58
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,110
Bye!

59
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,520
Jody.

60
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,690
Jodei!

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
You will win, Jya

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,650
You will win, Jya
You better win the Match 
against the Soviet team.

63
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,580
You better win the Match 
against the Soviet team.

64
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,240
Jigoro-sensei!

65
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,410
Let me go!

66
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,270
I'm just seeing someone off!

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,780
Non-passengers aren't supposed to get this far.

68
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,800
How'd you get in?

69
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,820
So you did come for me, sensei.

70
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,710
Jodei, Keep winning and winning 
the world level matches.

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,560
You do that, and you'll one day fight Yawara --

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,900
You do that, and you'll one day fight Yawara --
Enough, Gramps!

73
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,510
Enough, Gramps!

74
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,670
Enough, Gramps!
Jodei!

75
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,320
Jodei!

76
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,870
Jigoro-sensei.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
I will.. keep winning!

78
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,750
She left.

79
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,040
Yeah.

80
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,220
I hope she wins the match.

81
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,620
I'm sure she will.

82
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,400
Wow, it's so pretty.

83
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,930
Oh yeah, an airport at night 
is an ideal dating spot.

84
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,720
Then, it would be nice to eat somewhere
in the bay area and then..

85
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,550
Well, I need to go home and study.

86
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,760
Let's go eat something, at least.

87
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,820
Don't assume anything, 
just because Jody said so.

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,840
I.. it's just eating. What's there to assume?

89
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,380
What a brat. Gosh --

90
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,740
What a brat. Gosh --
Gosh, the customs inspection always
wastes our time. I hate it.

91
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,600
Gosh, the customs inspection always
wastes our time. I hate it.

92
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,940
Kazamatsuri-san!

93
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,980
Yawara-san!

94
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,390
Hon'ami Sayaka!

95
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,430
Well, well, what a coincidence.

96
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,490
This restaurant is owned by my company.

97
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,840
Please have all you want.

98
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,820
But, I had no idea that you two were a couple. Isn't it a perfect match, Kazamatsuri-san?

99
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,120
We are not going out.

100
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,880
We were just sending off Jody Rockwell.

101
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,050
I know.

102
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,970
Yawara-san won't possibly date a fishy newspaper reporter like him.



103
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,660
I am not fishy! You're the fishy one!

104
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,990
Here is the caviar and ikra dish.


105
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,180
It must be great to have an energetic
boyfriend, Yawara-san.

106
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,250
I told you he's not.

107
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,150
But, to think that Jigoro-sensei took in
that Jody Rockwell as his student...

108
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,580
Jigoro-san teaches only really strong students.

109
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,190
Unlike a certain someone 
who got rejected by him.

110
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,780
Oh, I'm very relieved to think that I didn't
get that weirdo as my sensei.

111
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,220
Uhh, have you decided what to order, sir?

112
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,980
How am I supposed to read this bad, worm-scribbled writing?

113
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,980
Uhh, it isn't worm scribbling. It's in French.

114
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,830
Just give me the best tasting food then.

115
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,360
Hah?

116
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,720
You guys serve good food, right?

117
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,250
When I asked the taxi driver where to 
get good food, he brought me here.


118
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,330
So, would you like the chef's choice, then?

119
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,250
Sure, give me the extra large helping 
of the shufu's choice.
[shufu -- house wife]

120
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,140
Yes.

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,740
Yeah, even I was taken aback by that.

122
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,610
Now that's quite a gathering.

123
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,990
And, what was the outcome of the
fight against Jody Rockwell?

124
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
It was incredible!

125
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,720
Yawara-san was leading the whole way.

126
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,670
She handled Jody's giant body with ease and attacked continuously like a storm, then...


127
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,720
But, she was really strong.

128
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,240
The match ended in a draw.

129
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,630
Oh, that's it?

130
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,290
So it turns out that you couldn't 
get an ippon victory from her?

131
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,390
Pathetic.

132
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,860
No she's not! Because of Jody's injury, 
she canceled the match.

133
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,760
That's just an excuse.

134
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,570
But, during the same time period, I've become stronger than Yawara-san, right?

135
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,610
W.. well, yes.

136
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,730
Oh, you're so sure of yourself.

137
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,700
Absolutely.

138
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:57,860
For the past two months, we went on an 
almost bloody, around-the-world training
tour to fight world class athletes.

139
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,790
That Sayaka on a training tour? How brave.



140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,840
But, this sure is a weird miso soup.

141
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,390
You officially trained at the Pornalef dojo?

142
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,420
I took on his comprehensive training curriculum with ease.


143
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,780
He seldom praised people, but when 
he saw how wonderful I was, he said..

144
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,680
Tres Bien, Jya! Tres Bien, Jya!

145
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,770
According to him, Sayaka-san is the most talented athlete he's developed so far.

146
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,870
Why does he say 'Jya' a lot?

147
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,400
Eh...

148
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,460
Oh, Pornalef-sensei is an avid follower
of Jigoro-sensei's judo style.


149
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,650
Eh?

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,880
My Grandpa is that famous?

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,320
It's just a horrible mistake.

152
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,690
Eii, what the heck are they talking about?

153
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,350
Seems like they're talking about me, but..

154
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,760
Here is the caviar and ikra dish. Huh?

155
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,120
U.. umm, sir?

156
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,660
You went against Belgium's Stelkes
and Korea's Kim Yonsku?

157
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,980
Yes. She flipped Stelkes in a flash.

158
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:19,460
But, against Korea's secret weapon, Kim Yonsku, the fierce match ended in a draw, leaving bitter frustration for both of them.



159
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:29,240
Let me point out that if I hadn't been tired 
from the plane rides, I would have taken
her down in less than 10 seconds.

160
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,840
She was rather lucky.

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,260
I have become really strong.

162
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,480
Many times more than the previous
match in the Martial Arts Hall.

163
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,480
Yawara-san, you no longer come
close to being my rival.

164
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,100
G.. good for you.

165
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,930
Whatever. You may have become stronger, but Yawara-san's strength is way more than that.

166
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,900
Oh, shall we find out now?

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,370
Right, Yawara-san?

168
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,070
Not on your life.

169
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,170
Oh, so you're scared of me?

170
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,870
Don't sweat it.

171
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,190
Grandpa!
Jigoro-sensei!
Jigoro-san!


172
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,950
I heard it all. Don't get ahead of yourselves.

173
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,340
Settle the match in an official tournament.

174
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,600
What's this?

175
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,100
Yawara's tournament schedule.

176
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,420
I've entered her in all of them.

177
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,400
What!?

178
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,970
From small ones to large ones. 
10 tournaments in 3 months!

179
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,640
I can't believe it!

180
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,780
I'm not doing any tournaments.

181
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,380
Didn't you promise?

182
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,080
Eh?

183
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,050
You promised to do a match with Jodei, right?

184
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,750
You've only been in Just one 
official tournament so far.

185
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,180
The tournaments that Jodei does 
are world class leveled ones.

186
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,130
You think a rookie with no substantial 
record like you can participate in 
those world class tournaments?

187
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,920
If you want to keep the promise 
with Jodei, do the tournaments!

188
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,360
Do them and do some more, compile 
a winning record, then get in a world
class tournament to fight Jodei!

189
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,820
B.. but, I have to study for the entrance exams..

190
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,230
Oh, okay.

191
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,330
So you're the type of kid that 
breaks promises just like that.

192
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,510
Okay, okay.

193
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,620
I'm fine with it, but if Jodei hears about it, there's no saying how sad she'll be.

194
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,790
Probably sad, and dejected...

195
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,880
..oh, I can just feel her pain!

196
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,330
Yawara-san!



197
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,370
If you want to fight Yawara, just do one 
of the tournaments on her schedule.

198
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,120
There's a lot to choose from.

199
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,400
Yawara-san!

200
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,980
Wait, Yawara-san!

201
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,130
What are you going to do?

202
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,330
As Jigoro-san said, you don't have
enough official records to be able 
to fight Jody in a tournament.

203
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,990
If you don't do anything, then it'll take a long time before you can fulfill your promise.

204
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,360
You're going to try to enter the Mitsuba 2-year Women's College, housekeeping major, right?

205
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,330
If you follow that tournament schedule, 
you'll surely fail the exam.

206
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,400
Maybe you should take back your promise?

207
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,300
Maybe I should.. try it.

208
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,980
I can't possibly break a promise with Jody, who came all the way from Canada just to fight me.

209
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,290
You sure?




210
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,740
So, you're not going to study for the 
entrance exams and enter Saikai 
College as a scholarship athlete?

211
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,950
I'll study for the exams, too.

212
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,660
I'll study and do the tournaments for Jody.

213
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,900
I think I should try to do everything I want to do.

214
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,410
Everything you want to do?


215
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,780
You've always been avoiding judo, 
but you want to fight Jody?

216
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm not sure, but when I fought Jody, 
it was the first time..

217
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,500
..I felt a sort of excitement from judo, and, well..

218
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,270
..so, I want to fight Jody one more time.

219
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,380
Just Jody.

220
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,440
She's fired up.

221
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:32,980
It's still a small flame, but Jody Rockwell definitely started a fire within Yawara-san.

222
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,100
Ippon! 
[Ippon -- victory]

223
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,350
Champion! Inokuma Yawara, first degree black belt, is the Ruby Women's Judo Cup Champion.

224
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,220
As with the Oshiuri Cup tournament, 
she won with all ippon victories.

225
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,730
The invincible Inokuma!

226
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,470
Jigoro's secret notebook

227
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,070
Jigoro's secret notebook
This wasn't much of a tournament, 
but one win so far.

228
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,090
This wasn't much of a tournament, 
but one win so far.

229
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,110
Next is the Magatama Cup, five days from now.

230
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,450
If Yawara wins all 10 tournaments within 3 months, her reputation will skyrocket.

231
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,330
This plan is infallibly successful.


232
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,150
But, why did Yawara agree 
to this setup so easily?

233
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,880
If she doesn't do these 10 tournaments, 
she can't be in a world tournament.

234
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,040
And her promise with Jodei would be broken...

235
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,800
..what a great setup!

236
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,230
How can she participate in
such a minor tournament?

237
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,440
Even if I wanted to fight her, I can't possibly lower myself to be in this kind of tournament.

238
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,660
My reputation would be ruined.


239
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,560
Let's go home, Kazamatsuri-san.

240
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Champion, Inokuma Yawara athlete.

241
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Champion, Inokuma Yawara athlete.
Yawara-san.

242
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,980
Champion, Inokuma Yawara athlete.

243
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,080
Isn't it amazing?

244
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,640
Compared to the match against Rockwell, 
she won this cup without even trying.

245
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,310
Just as I thought.

246
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,540
About what?

247
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,980
Yawara-san is doing too much.

248
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,270
She probably pulled an all-nighter yesterday, studying for exams.

249
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,110
Eh?


250
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,200
She got first place after doing an all-nighter?

251
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,970
Her execution wasn't as sharp as usual.

252
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,630
She doesn't understand how
important sleep is for athletes.

253
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,270
You're going to break down if you 
keep this up, Yawara-san.

254
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,350
33 times.

255
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,590
You yawned 33 times while you're with us.

256
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,620
No boys will approach you.

257
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,240
I know you have to study, but staying up 
all night will make you ugly.

258
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,030
Hey, tomorrow's Sunday. Maybe we 
should go out to do something.

259
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,580
Like eat lunch at a French restaurant.

260
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,460
You've got to come for a change, Yawara.

261
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,690
Tomorrow is the Magatama Cup.

262
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm sorry, tomorrow I have..

263
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,000
A date, right?

264
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,980
You going on a date with 
Kazamatsuri-san, right?

265
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,930
N.. no.

266
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,600
Inokuma.

267
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,740
Hanazono-kun.

268
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,970
Inokuma, I heard that you won the 
Ruby Cup with all ippon victories.

269
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,960
Congratulations!

270
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,910
Thanks.

271
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,100
Yawara, you still doing judo?

272
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,320
Well, sort of.

273
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,190
Tomorrow is the Magatama Cup, right? 
Good luck.

274
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,830
Oh, so it's not a date. I see.

275
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,680
You're finally devoting yourself to judo, huh?

276
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:41,550
Inokuma, my heart is very full. You taught me that dreams come true through effort.

277
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,780
Umm, Hanazono-kun..

278
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,790
I will also pursue judo like you.

279
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,470
And.. and..


280
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,580
..if I get into Saikai College with you,
I want to ask you...

281
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,100
Oh, forget it. Don't worry about it.

282
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,310
Well, good luck.

283
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,140
Musashiyama. Fight-oh, fight-oh.

284
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,170
There, Yawara-chan, throw her now!

285
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,410
Honey, rewind it back so we can watch it again.

286
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,020
Okay, okay.

287
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,620
It gets better the more we watch it.

288
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,530
I still can't believe it.

289
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,700
Oh yeah.

290
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,650
Oh, Yawara-chan. It's so great to see the girl that we saw growing up fight so bravely on TV.

291
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,030
You're so bad, Jigoro-san. Hiding her 
from the public for such a long time.

292
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,550
But, this match is nothing.

293
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,160
The true objective is the Olympic Gold Medal.

294
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,680
Gold Medal?!

295
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,790
A gold Medal, huh? That's big.

296
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:53,880
A gold Medal, huh? That's big.
But if it's Yawara-chan, maybe.. just maybe..

297
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,740
But if it's Yawara-chan, maybe.. just maybe..

298
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,040
Yes.

299
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,730
If it's Yawara-chan, maybe.. just maybe..

300
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,700
Okay, then to celebrate Yawara-chan's chance to win the gold medal, let's have a party.


301
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah, I'll make all the sushi we need. 
Let's go all-out.

302
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,300
We should drink the famous Meisei Hell sake, and get the super deluxe sushi platter.

303
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,040
I'm working hard, Jody.

304
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,500
Are you training hard, too?

305
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,650
Kazamatsuri-san.

306
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,450
As you said, am I shining most 
brilliantly when I do judo?

307
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,330
Am I, Kazamatsuri-san?


308
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,560
Geez, how late is she going stay up?

309
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,700
Hurry up and go to sleep already. Don't you have a tournament tomorrow?

310
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,220
That was a big cat.

311
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,490
..Yawara..

312
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,180
..the National Achievement Award...

313
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,240
We will now begin the final round 
of the under 48kg class match.

314
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,060
I drank a bit too much last night.


315
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,220
Bow!

316
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,490
Begin!

317
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,730
Yawara!

318
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,860
Ippon! 
[Ippon -- Victory]

319
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,260
That was close.

320
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Wow!

321
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,990
Yawara-chan's amazing!

322
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,560
Well, that's two tournaments down.

323
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,540
But, that was sad, Yawara!

324
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,770
Magatama Women's Judo Cup Champion, Inokuma Yawara, first degree black belt.

325
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,830
As usual, she won with all ippon victories.



326
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,280
How long will her winning streak be?

327
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:37,760
Invincible Inokuma!

328
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,490
Invincible Inokuma!
Yawara-san.

329
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,550
Invincible Inokuma!

330
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,850
Gosh, Shin-chan.

331
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,220
You're glued to the TV and you're
ignoring me. I hate you!

332
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,470
That's not true.

333
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,960
I'm only interested in you.

334
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,110
Really?

335
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,300
Yeah, of course.

336
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,780
I'm so happy!

337
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,020
What's wrong, Yawara-san?

338
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,900
That wasn't your usual judo style.

339
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,380
Is something going on, Yawara-san?

340
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,800
Yawara-san.

341
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,420
What was that match all about?

342
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,390
What do you mean?

343
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,110
You spaced out a bit, didn't you?

344
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,080
No, I didn't.

345
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,380
You can't go full strength on lack of sleep.


346
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,240
What's scarier is an injury. At that rate, 
you might get seriously injured.

347
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,560
Don't worry about me.

348
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,550
You should worry about yourself staying
out all night, Matsuda-san.

349
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,040
You have bags under your eyes.

350
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,260
Well, a lot of girls do ask me out, you know.

351
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,400
Get some sleep already!

352
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,760
Say hi to your girlfriend!

353
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,550
Geez.

354
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,110
Well, back to studying.

355
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:24,100
824 Days to the Barcelona Olympics


356
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,650
Yawara! What's with that last match?

357
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,220
A half-assed effort like that won't get 
you any closer to fighting Jodei.

358
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,260
A half-assed effort like that won't get 
you any closer to fighting Jodei.
But, Grandpa..

359
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,150
But, Grandpa..

360
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,270
But, Grandpa..
But, schmut! How dare you 
sleep during a match!

361
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,050
But, schmut! How dare you 
sleep during a match!

362
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,540
You were probably studying 
for exams, weren't you?

363
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,180
Well..

364
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,450
Well..
Well, schmell! I forbid you to study!

365
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,530
Well, schmell! I forbid you to study!

366
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,110
Hey..

367
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,340
Hey..
Hey, schmey!

368
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,480
Hey, schmey!

369
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,130
Wait..

370
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,970
Wait, schwait, Kuwait!
