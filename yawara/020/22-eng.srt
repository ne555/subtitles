Akirame kirenai. Yume no kakera sutenaide!

9
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,430
Yawara Inokuma, I came all the way
from Canada to see you.

10
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,610
56, 57...

11
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,400
I'll fail. If I keep this up, 
I'll fail the entrance exam.

12
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,190
Why'd you chase her away?

13
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,330
She studied Japanese really hard, 
so that she could fight you.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,990
She must've thought that you'd fight her
if she was able to say it right.

15
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,510
S.. so she didn't sleep, studied all night, and went to early morning practices like me?

16
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,710
Jody!

17
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,900
What's wrong, Yawara?

18
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,800
I'm so sorry, Jody.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,400
I said such mean things to you.

20
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,690
I'm so sorry.

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,980
Let's do a match, Jody!

22
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,880
She took the bait.

23
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,250
Let's Fight, Yawara!

24
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,570
This is bad, Matsuda-san.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,710
We're like burglars.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,420
If we keep doing this, we'll get
arrested for trespassing.

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,850
Stop bickering and get your butt up there.

28
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,130
You idiot! Using my face as a stepladder..!

29
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,400
Gimme a hand here. Now, pull hard.

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,540
That Jody Rockwell is at 
the Inokuma household.

31
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,680
The 72kg heavyweight world-class defender, Jody Rockwell, and Inokuma Yawara...

32
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,500
... are under one roof, so there 
has to be something going on.

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,340
You're such a pervert.

34
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,000
What's going on in there then?

35
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,200
You're such a... such a...

36
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,830
If my hunch is right, something's 
going on for sure.

37
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,020
We don't even get paid overtime for this...

38
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,570
Oh.. oh gosh!

39
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,750
Matsuda-san, Yawara-san and 
Rockwell are f.. finally --

40
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,780
You're too loud. Come on, 
get the camera ready.

41
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,980
Sneaking around again?

42
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,270
You hyenas!

43
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,430
M.. Matsuda-san.

44
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,050
H.. hey there.

45
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,160
Stop standing there and come here!

46
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,180
Stop standing there and come here!
S.. sorry! We won't sneak 
around anymore! Forgive us!

47
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,690
S.. sorry! We won't sneak 
around anymore! Forgive us!

48
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,670
Sit there.

49
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,980
G.. Grandpa?

50
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,920
That line of the tatami will be 
the boundary. Understand?

51
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,610
I see. The line referee.

52
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,490
You're there.

53
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,140
Sit up straight now.

54
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

55
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,970
Oh?

56
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,360
That's a nice watch for a measly salary.

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,790
Th.. thank you.

58
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,400
The time limit is four minutes.

59
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,670
Keep your eyes peeled for that.

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,340
I.. I will.

61
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,660
Okay, we can start the match now.

62
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:47,940
Bow!

63
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,390
Umm, Matsuda-san.

64
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,330
Please don't put it in the paper.

65
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,360
O.. of course I'll splash it on the
front page as an exclusive scoop!

66
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,420
Not! I won't ever do that.

67
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,040
Promise? I don't want to be
troubled or bothered by it.

68
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,810
Wait up! What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,380
When did I ever give you trouble?

70
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,200
All the time.

71
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,180
How could you think like that? I always try my hardest to think and do what's best for you -

72
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,460
W.. well, you know...

73
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,230
Anyway, please don't cover this story.

74
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,220
You don't need to tell me twice.



75
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,290
You aren't getting away with this.

76
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,880
It's all settled. You can fight
all you want, Yawara.

77
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,790
And so... Bow!

78
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,630
Begin!

79
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,680
Darn!

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,580
I can't even cover this story, but if Yawara-san happens to win this match...

81
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,360
...it will be quite a feat!

82
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,500
Yawara, I'm very happy to come to Japan.

83
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,840
I can finally test your true strength.


84
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,370
It's the same as Jigoro-sensei. 
There are no gaps to step into.

85
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,520
If I step in randomly, I'll be in trouble.

86
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,940
But, I came here just for this fight. 
Not for a staring match.

87
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,090
I don't know what will happen, but I'm coming!

88
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,980
J.. jyogai. 
[yogai -- Out of bounds]

89
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,100
That was close.

90
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,610
She was about to score an 
ippon victory from me.

91
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,550
Yawara. This girl is.. very, very strong.

92
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:48,630
Jody. She's... strong.

93
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,190
Her look's changed.

94
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,530
I've never seen Yawara-san
with that look in her eyes.

95
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,610
Flipping out, huh, Yawara.

96
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,820
The world has strong people like her.

97
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,520
You're still just a small fish in a small pond.

98
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,700
Begin!

99
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,520
Tokunaga.

100
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,630
Y.. yes?

101
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,360
Are we not at the final destination of my around-the-world training tour, Seoul, yet?

102
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,400
We're almost there, Miss.

103
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,590
You keep saying that.

104
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,760
Go tell the pilot to fly faster.

105
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,340
B.. but...

106
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,570
"The Sayaka" plane is already 
going as fast as it can, Miss.

107
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,920
I'm so bored.


108
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,890
Kazamatsuri-san.

109
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,220
What were you thinking about for so long?

110
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,630
The same thing as you, Sayaka-san.

111
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,590
Even as we speak, Inokuma Yawara 
is getting stronger by the minute.

112
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,250
At least, that's what I feel.

113
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,090
We'll start training now.

114
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,030
Make preparations, Tokunaga.

115
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,560
Preparations? But how?

116
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,190
Clear away the junk here and 
make this space into a dojo.

117
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,650
B.. but..

118
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,640
Right now.

119
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,250
Yes.

120
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,560
Get moving, Tokunaga.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,850
Miss...

122
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,180
Yuko! 
[Yuko -- partial 5 points]

123
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,460
Pay attention, timekeeper. It's out of bounds.

124
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,990
Right.


125
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,230
Yawara-san is forcefully attacked.

126
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,980
Is it that hard to go against 
a world level athlete?

127
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,690
Begin!

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
Oh no!

129
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,820
Oh man!

130
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,550
If that giant completes the tate shihoh gatame, it'll be impossible to break free!
[tate shihoh gatame -- vertical 4-corner hold]



131
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,270
She's pinned! There's no way out!

132
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,830
Quit whining, timekeeper.

133
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,030
It's an osae komi. Time it for 30 seconds.
[osae komi -- pindown]

134
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,500
Y.. yeah.

135
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,380
But at this rate, Yawara-san will lose.

136
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,990
If she does lose this bad, then she deserves it.

137
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,180
She should lose big at least once and 
realize the harsh reality of fights.

138
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,700
B.. but, wait..

139
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,940
Keep your distance, assistant referee.

140
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,310
What's the time?

141
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,120
10 seconds past.

142
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,650
Why aren't you concerned?

143
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,970
Yawara-san's about to lose for the first time.

144
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,110
Fine.

145
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,290
That's why I let her fight Jodei in the first place.

146
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,000
Time?

147
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,280
15 seconds past.


148
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,630
How about it, Kim Yonsku athlete.

149
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,150
Will you accept the fight?

150
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,250
Hon'ami Sayaka.

151
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,230
Now I remember.

152
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,930
Inokuma Yawara defeated your
sorry little rich girl butt, right?

153
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,380
Translator, what did she say?

154
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,820
Gee, I shouldn't translate that for you.

155
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,830
You came all the way to Seoul to get
your butt kicked by me, right?

156
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,510
I shouldn't translate that for you, either.

157
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,930
I'd be more than happy to take you on!

158
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,490
This girl barks way too much and irritates me.

159
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,320
She must be really scared of losing to me.

160
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,630
Not really, but it shouldn't 
be translated anyway.

161
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,770
Begin!

162
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,700
Yawara doesn't have enough 
guts to break the hold.

163
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,470
It's punishment for not practicing
seriously enough these days.

164
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,690
She's been taking it too easily after winning that petty Martial Arts Hall Championship.

165
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,840
What's the time?

166
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,850
20 seconds past.

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,280
What! It's already 20 seconds!

168
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,900
She b.. broke free.

169
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,580
Whoa! She did it!

170
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,990
And you thought she'd lose!

171
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,140
This is interesting.


172
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,750
Now she's finally serious.

173
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,370
Serious?

174
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,820
So she wasn't serious until now?

175
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,190
Of course not.

176
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,170
The match against Tohdoh Yuki and at the Martial Arts Hall was all play for her.

177
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,280
Play?

178
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,830
Yuko! 
[Yuko -- partial 5 points]

179
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,990
I'm thrilled!

180
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,800
This is the first time I fought 
a strong person like you!

181
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,210
Let's have more fun!


182
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,200
She was able to try an ude-garami 
from that off- balance position!
[ude-garami -- entangled armlock]

183
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,060
She's really amazing!

184
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,670
I was about to get joint-locked by her.

185
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,340
She's finally met her match.

186
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,310
Yawara's encountered a strong opponent for the first time, so she's actually enjoying it.

187
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,850
Waza-ari! 
[Waza-ari -- semi 7 points]

188
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,870
How strong!


189
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,880
Yawara-san was that strong?

190
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,510
Kinda late to notice that.

191
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:54,370
Well, in all her matches so far, she threw her opponents as soon as they touched her, so..

192
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,300
..it's the first time I've seen such a 
fired-up Yawara-san in a match.

193
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,100
That's..!

194
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,780
Of all the grappling style martial arts, Korean wrestling has the closest in-fighting style.

195
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,640
Unlike Japanese wrestling (sumo), in which the opponent is just pushed out of bounds...

196
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,090
...Korean wrestling is a power throw game.





197
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,800
Kim's judo style incorporates Korean wrestling.

198
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,380
She's hard to beat, even for Sayaka-san.

199
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,810
Yuko! 
[Yuko -- partial 5 points]

200
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,060
She's struggling.

201
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:51,680
Of all her matches in her around-the-world fighting tour, this is her biggest struggle.

202
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,980
She's so exponentially strong!

203
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,930
Eii! You're so loud.


204
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,570
This is still nothing.

205
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,360
Still nothing?

206
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,130
Look, she still can't get an ippon victory even after whipping out all those moves.

207
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,880
That big idiot.

208
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,120
B.. but, her opponent is a world champ.


209
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,900
Why can't you be nice for once and 
praise her for doing so well?

210
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,650
Too soft. You're so soft.

211
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,050
That's why you can't get better than being a third-rate reporter at a third-rate newspaper.

212
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,970
That's none of your business.


213
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,310
How can I praise her if she hasn't accomplished her objectives?

214
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:43,480
When she becomes a world champ, with an Olympic gold medal and the National Achievement Award, then -

215
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,090
Then what?

216
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,220
I'll finally praise her.

217
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,550
Inokuma Yawara wasn't strong. 
You're too weak.

218
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,620
Translator, what did she say?

219
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,800
I shouldn't translate that for you, either.



220
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,910
Sayaka-san, that's not what you
should be thinking about.

221
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,820
She's had it!

222
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,140
Yuko! 
[Yuko -- partial 5 points]

223
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,830
Excellent!

224
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,000
She retaliated against Kim's 
speedy combo moves.

225
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,840
Sayaka-san's become so much stronger.

226
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,550
I've got you now!

227
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,410
Are you okay, Jody?

228
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,170
I'm okay.

229
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,690
It's not good to worry about the 
opponent during a match, Yawara.

230
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,170
Here I come!

231
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,270
Let's stop, Jody.

232
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,330
Your arm is seriously injured.

233
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,400
Take care of your arm.

234
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,400
Don't ruin your arm over a practice match.

235
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,040
Look, i.. it's okay! Yawara, let's fight!

236
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,080
No.

237
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,450
You can't fight at full-strength anymore, Jody.

238
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,040
End of match!

239
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,860
End of match!

240
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,150
A draw!

241
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,070
I came all the way... from Canada!

242
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,340
To fight you, Yawara!

243
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,990
Because of Jodei's injury, this match is nulled.

244
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,610
A draw!


245
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,450
I've never had so much fun 
doing judo until now!

246
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,490
Please, fight me, Yawara!

247
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,960
Yawara, please!

248
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,910
Jody..

249
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,830
This is the first time I've ever had fun, too.

250
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,300
So, next time..

251
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,180
Next time?

252
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,140
When your arm is healed, 
let's fight again, okay?

253
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,750
At a competition somewhere.

254
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,680
R.. really? Yawara?

255
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,650
Yes. I promise.

256
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,250
Again, at a competition, somewhere!

257
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,380
She promised!

258
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,530
You hear that?

259
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,690
Oh yeah!

260
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,320
For real?

261
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,070
Yes.

262
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,390
I really hate you.

263
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,740
I'll kick your butt in an official
competition next time.

264
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,970
Translator, what did she say?

265
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,550
I shouldn't translate that for you, either.

266
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,000
I really hate this person.

267
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,150
I'll beat her the next time around.

268
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,240
I really shouldn't translate that for you, either.

269
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,080
Miss!

270
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,920
Miss!

271
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,050
Sayaka-san!

272
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,630
Sayaka-san!

273
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,740
Is it really okay for us to be treated for dinner?


274
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,300
Yawara, you're a strong judo athlete
and a very good cook.

275
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,300
Would you like seconds, Matsuda-san?

276
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,110
They're probably gonna ask us not to do a story on tonight's match by treating us to dinner.

277
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,300
So basically, we're being bribed.

278
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,430
Stop being so immature, Matsuda-san.

279
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,850
So, Matsuda-san, you're finished?

280
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,500
H.. hey, wait up!

281
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,580
I never said I was done.


282
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,200
Then, stop complaining and enjoy the meal.

283
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,730
You shouldn't fight with your boyfriend like that.

284
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,350
B.. boyfriend?!

285
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,870
This kind of guy isn't my boyfriend!

286
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,230
Don't talk about me like that!

287
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,400
Come on, shake hands and make up.

288
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,410
Matsuda-san, you're blushing. How cute!

289
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,300
Oww!

290
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,220
A third-rate sports reporter like you won't 
be allowed to hold hands with Yawara.

291
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,260
A third-rate sports reporter like you won't 
be allowed to hold hands with Yawara.
Not even in ten.. no a hundred 
thousand years from now either.

292
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,780
Not even in ten.. no a hundred 
thousand years from now either.

293
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,430
Get up, Matsuda-san.

294
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,110
Grandpa.

295
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,800
Jigoro-sensei. You're great! 
Wonderful! Fantastic!

296
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,050
I'm fundara-stick, jya!

297
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,090
What the heck is that?

831 Days Until Barcelona Olympics



299
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,450
As soon as I thought I made a new friend,
Jody, she went back to Canada.

300
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,960
Jodei has a lot world level matches coming up.

301
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,390
You need to practice to prepare
yourself for the world.

302
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,620
But Jody has a wonderful boyfriend. 
I'm envious.

303
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,090
What the heck are you thinking about?

304
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,200
Come on, do some matches.

305
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,530
You need to build up your record 
for Jodei's sake, too.

306
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
When will I ever make a boyfriend?

307
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,800
Next time, on "Yawara" --

308
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,840
"See You Again, Yawara"

309
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,570
I'll do a kata-guruma throw on 
those who don't watch.
