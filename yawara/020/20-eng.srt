9
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,520
Is it really okay for us to ditch work?

10
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,350
If the Chief finds out, he'll raise hell.


11
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,530
Matsuda-san?

12
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,410
You haven't been too happy these days.

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,490
So, I guess you're still shocked about Yawara-san's feelings toward Kazamatsuri.

14
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,530
So, I guess you're still shocked about Yawara-san's feelings toward Kazamatsuri.
Shut up!

15
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,960
Shut up!

16
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,620
Quit mumbling.

17
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,150
I'm only interested in Inokuma 
Yawara as a judo athlete.

18
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,830
Let's go, Kamoda.

19
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,710
Wait a minute!

20
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,790
Matsuda-san!

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
G.. geez.

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,550
W.. wait.

23
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,070
W.. wait.
What are you doing?

24
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,970
What are you doing?

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,410
I.. I'm sorry.

26
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,150
Yawara-san.

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,670
Episode 20
The Big Guest For Yawara

28
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,720
P.. please stop!

29
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,460
It's completely healed.

30
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,430
I.. i.. it is!

31
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,270
It doesn't hurt at all!

32
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,930
You should have come to me earlier
for such a simple fracture.

33
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,420
Thank you very much.

34
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,270
I never knew that you were
a bone-setting doctor.

35
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,750
My treatment results are quick, and even if the methods are rough, fractures are fixed in no time.

36
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,200
Now all you need to do is rub this balm on.

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,080
What is this balm?

38
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,090
My special blend.

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,800
It has boiled leech.

40
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,990
Le..?

41
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,590
It improves the circulation of the area wrapped in the cast that has had restricted blood flow.

42
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,950
I also have boiled black-widow spider 
syrup, burnt gecko ointment, and 
blue-green snake extract, too.

43
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,020
N.. no thank you!

44
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:55,570
Anyway, ever since Yawara-san won the national title, it must be really restless around here.

45
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,280
Yes, the college scouts have been 
sending us lots of invitations.



46
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,130
Every college is bending over
backwards to get her.

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,260
All because once they get Yawara-san...

48
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,650
... it's more than guaranteed that
they'd win all the matches.

49
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,520
Just by showing a hint of what she can do,
it has caused this much commotion.

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,720
If she displays more of her strength, 
the whole world will flip.

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,030
But Yawara-san will go to the nation's best, Saikai College, right?

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,800
Oh!

53
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,420
I'm going to try to get in there, too.


54
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,070
If things go well, I could go to the 
same school with her again.

55
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,810
Their coach, Mr. Yuutenji, who I thought had just a big face, has a lot of passion, too.

56
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,590
Is that so?

57
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,860
Then Yawara-san will get into Saikai College, and conquer the nationals.



58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,420
And go to the Olympics, and get the
gold medal, of course. Then..

59
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,500
..she'll receive the National 
Achievement Award!

60
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,440
What's wrong, Hanazono-kun?

61
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,280
Inokuma, you keep getting 
further away from me.

62
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,550
S.. Sensei! I.. I.. I..

63
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,320
What's wrong?

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,440
I.. think Yawara-san...

65
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,950
..to be able to see Yawara-san develop
into a superstar so closely..

66
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,560
..I am so happy!

67
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,290
Hanazono-kun, wait!

68
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,380
Don't tell me that you...

69
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,750
..were trying to go home without 
paying for the treatment, huh?

70
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,510
What?

71
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,100
I see. Mitsuba Women's 2-year College, Housekeeping Major.

72
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,240
Yes, it's my first choice.

73
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,420
Mitsuba's entrance exams are pretty difficult.

74
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,300
And there aren't any athletic scholarship 
admittances. And there aren't 
any judo clubs, either.

75
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,230
Yes, I know. But, it's been my first choice before all of that, so, I'll do my best.

76
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,500
So, you're going to quit judo?

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,630
So, you're going to quit judo?
N.. no way.

78
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,850
N.. no way.

79
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,160
Then what about your victory 
at the Martial Arts Hall?

80
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,130
What were those tears of victory for..?

81
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,950
Well, I guess the reason for her doing that match was for Kazamatsuri anyway.

82
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,660
The guys in the judo club taught me something.

83
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,160
If you try your best, you can achieve anything.



84
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,530
That's why I'm going to do my 
best to study for the exams.

85
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,840
You're serious..?

86
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,170
Yawara-san! It's true that Hon'ami Sayaka 
was totally defeated by you.

87
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,300
But, she hasn't given up yet!

88
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,560
She went to train in Europe with Coach Kazamatsuri to become stronger.

89
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,040
To beat you next time!

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,860
With Kazamatsuri-san?

91
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,880
Whatever Sayaka-san does
won't affect me anymore.

92
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,530
Seems like Yawara-san seriously
made her decision.

93
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,010
Tres bon! Splendid!

94
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,240
Mademoiselle Sayaka, you are tres bien!

95
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,030
KABAmatsuri-san, your guidance
is excellent, too.
[KABA -- hippo]

96
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,770
I have nothing else to teach her.

97
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,780
I'm KAZAmatsuri.

98
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,590
But Pornalef-san, there is someone 
who threw me very easily.

99
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,590
Yes, I saw it in the paper.

100
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,810
Yawara Inokuma, the ippon zeoi gal, yes? 
[ippon zeoi -- one arm shoulder throw]

101
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,520
But, I cannot believe that she threw Sayaka-san in 2 seconds, jya.

102
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,720
I can't believe it either.

103
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,870
But it's a fact.

104
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,320
That's why we came to you, a man 
who developed numerous world 
class athletes, Pornalef-sensei.

105
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,650
Sayaka-san is already talented enough
to win a world competition, jya.

106
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,350
I'd like to meet Yawara Inokuma, jya.

107
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,730
Pornalef-sensei, your Japanese is very good...

108
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,180
..but would you please refrain from saying 'jya'?

109
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,410
It reminds me of someone I despise 
and it gives me the chills.

110
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,690
Oh yes, I studied really hard to learn Japanese.

111
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,090
It's because I wanted to read this book, jya.

112
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,680
Th.. that's..!

113
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,100
Oh, I have it, too.

114
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,550
Oh, KABAmatsuri, you've read this book, too?
[KABA -- hippo]

115
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,020
No wonder your methods of coaching Sayaka-san are so excellent.

116
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,150
I'm KAZAmatsuri.

117
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,310
I learned the real meaning of judo from this book, and became even stronger.

118
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,070
This book is the bible for judo.

119
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,560
That's exactly right.

120
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:04,100
And, Inokuma Yawara is the granddaughter 
of this book's author, Inokuma Jigoro.

121
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,310
Wh.. what?

122
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,970
Is that true, KABAmatsuri? 
[KABA -- hippo]

123
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,310
Yes, and he personally trained her, too.

124
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,280
And, I'm KAZAmatsuri.

125
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,770
I see. Now it's understandable why Sayaka-san was thrown by her, jya.

126
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,770
Inokuma Yawara and Inokuma Jigoro are the worst sore spots for my eyes, jya-

127
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:25,850
Inokuma Yawara and Inokuma Jigoro are the worst sore spots for my eyes, jya-
It's not only you, Sayaka-san.

128
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,730
It's not only you, Sayaka-san.

129
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,170
Yawara-san would be sore spots on the eyes 
of 4 other athletes around the world, jya.

130
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,250
Four?

131
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,610
Yes.


132
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:40,510
I recognize four strong female judo athletes around the world, other than you, jya.

133
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:49,270
They'll surely compete viciously with the
goal of defeating Yawara Inokuma, jya.

134
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,340
Once more!

135
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,420
Kim seems very fired up for the Olympics.

136
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,300
Yes.

137
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,200
But she has another reason to be excited.

138
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,030
Another reason?



139
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,040
Yes, Japan's Inokuma Yawara.

140
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,380
Is this Inokuma strong?

141
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,240
She just made her debut in an official match...

142
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,100
...so it's hard to measure her strength, 
but upon seeing a video of her in action, 
Kim was sweating profusely, jya.

143
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,990
That level-headed Kim, sweating?

144
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,540
So, Teleshikova.

145
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,480
This is the Yawara Inokuma
that you asked to see.

146
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,460
Thank you very much. I shall
return to my training.

147
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,770
What's wrong, Teleshikova?

148
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,220
That little girl can't possibly 
be a worthy opponent?

149
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,940
I've never been so excited in my life.

150
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,260
I really feel very happy to do judo, 
from the bottom of my heart.

151
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,570
It's amazing that you do judo and
you're a top model, Ms. Belkens.

152
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,370
Modeling is my business. Judo is 
just one of my hobbies.

153
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,230
I can win because I have the luxury to do so.

154
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:29,110
Oh, Ms. Belkens, did you hear about
the news of a rising star in Japan?

155
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,180
Yawara Inokuma.

156
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,090
Yes, she excites me, for a change.

157
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,480
An exciting life... that's the key to my beauty.


158
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,540
The women's judo world is brimming 
with excitement, jya.

159
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,190
Korea's Kim.

160
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,630
Soviet's Teleshikova.

161
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,840
Belgium's queen, Belkens.

162
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,170
And, one more, Canada's giant..!

163
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,030
Are the rumors about the relationship true?

164
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,110
How is your every day life with him?

165
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,070
The viewers want to know about this!

166
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,180
He's just her friend, and she's not 
in that kind of relationship...

167
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,150
But, sources in LA confirm that they've
been meeting in secrecy.

168
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,670
Well, that's...

169
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,960
Well, that's...
Please give a straight answer. The truth.

170
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,540
Please give a straight answer. The truth.

171
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,170
Ouch..

172
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,640
Matsuda-san, I got a spot for you..

173
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,500
Matsuda-san?

174
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,340
Yawara-san, is this what you really want?

175
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,750
To quit judo, and become a
normal college student?

176
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,110
Is that going to satisfy you?

177
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,220
Ah, Matsuda-san, what are 
you doing, ditching work?

178
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,010
Boring.

179
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,260
It might be boring, but it's still 
a job. It can't be helped.

180
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,160
Who cares about who she sticks 
with or what she does.

181
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:17,240
I'm a sports writer! Just because the celebrities department is short on 
people... I don't have time for that.

182
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,420
I'm going home! You do the rest.

183
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,780
N.. no way!

184
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,380
That's..!

185
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,430
Jody Rockwell.

186
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,010
Matsuda-san.

187
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,510
Why in the world?

188
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,440
Matsuda-san!

189
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,370
I'm going to pass the exam!

190
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,090
Oh, it's me.

191
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,750
It's me! ME!

192
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah, about that affair.. I'm going to 
visit you tomorrow, okay?

193
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,870
Hey, are you all right?

194
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,210
So, she canceled all her matches in Canada?

195
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,950
I see. No, thank you.

196
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,910
Jody Rockwell.

197
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,150
Why did she come to Japan?

198
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,950
Matsuda!

199
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,900
What is this wimpy article?

200
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,790
How many years have you been writing?

201
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,190
You've been daydreaming too much these days!

202
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,050
We don't have the luxury to
feed lazy employees!

203
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,220
Got that?

204
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,800
If you do, then you better fix your 
attitude and rewrite this piece!

205
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,990
N.. no, it can't be!

206
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,240
Let's go, Kamoda!

207
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,890
Hey, Matsuda!

208
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,180
S.. sorry, we're leaving.

209
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,780
W.. wait up!

210
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,510
You guys snuck out of school again?

211
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,000
Well, morning practices make us so hungry.

212
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,710
You guys have become more macho.

213
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,830
Here you go.


214
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,390
You're giving us extra helpings again?

215
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:26,630
Oh yeah. Since you guys raised your first victory, you need to become even stronger. 
I'm rooting for you all.

216
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,190
O.. oba-chan!

217
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:34,360
Whatever. You guys lost by default 
in the second round anyway.

218
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,500
Sudoh!

219
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,600
Oba-chan, I want a ramen, too.

220
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,990
Sudoh, it's your fault we lost by default.

221
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,770
How dare you get injured 
from a senseless fight!

222
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,990
Yeah.

223
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,500
Hanazono-san fought with his fracture 
and got us to win the first round.

224
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,520
If you weren't injured, we might've 
won the second round, too.

225
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,510
Second round?

226
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,980
Why are you guys so small-minded?

227
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,810
If I fought, we'd be champs! Champs!

228
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,670
Listen up, upperclassmen dudes.

229
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,990
Yawara-chan endorses my strength. I'm not satisfied with winning just the first round.

230
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,360
We were told that we were great 
by Yawara-san, too.

231
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,950
Her motherly instincts were just tickled.

232
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,180
If you're a man, impress Yawara-san 
with your accomplishments!

233
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,900
Hey, watch it --

234
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,690
Whoa!

235
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,790
Wh.. what would you like?

236
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,590
Go-nin mae! 
[Go-nin mae -- Five helpings]

237
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,410
Go-nin mae?! 
[Go-nin mae -- Five helpings]

238
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,190
Yes! Go-nin mae! 
[Go-nin mae -- Five helpings]

239
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,850
W.. w.. what is this woman?

240
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,880
How is our judo club?

241
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,840
Well, it's okay.

242
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,660
Thank you very much.

243
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,530
That guy in the front is pretty good, 
but has weak hips.

244
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,200
That short one in the far right corner has 
sharp skills but is weak in competitions.

245
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,020
Astonishing! With just a short observation, 
not only did he pick out my start players...

246
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,930
...but he also pinpointed their weaknesses!

247
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,930
Very terrifying, Inokuma Jigoro-sensei!

248
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,840
And, Inokuma Yawara, who was personally trained by him... I want her no matter what!

249
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,420
Sensei, your strength at such
an age is amazing.

250
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,870
What do you make of our judo club facilities?


251
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,840
No matter what toys you get, it won't 
make you stronger in judo.

252
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,190
But, you seem to be enjoying them.

253
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,110
Any place would be good training for Yawara.

254
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,350
I think I should let you have Yawara for a while.


255
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,560
Th.. thank you very much!

256
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,920
I will make her the nation's best, 
even if it costs me my life!

257
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,210
No, I will make Yawara-san the world's best!

258
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,060
Yuutenji-san.

259
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,320
Do you have any tea snacks?

260
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,000
Y.. yes. I have a mountain of ichigo daifuku. 
[ichigo daifuku -- strawberry ricecakes]

261
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,010
I'm not going to Saikai College.

262
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,860
But you can go there without 
taking any exams, right?

263
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,710
I'm jealous. I'd want to go in your place.

264
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,430
I want to go to Mitsuba Women's 2-year College.

265
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,840
It's difficult to get in there.

266
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,530
Why there?

267
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,190
I'm going to study really hard.

268
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,050
And mark the start of my lovely college life!

269
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,050
I'm going to give it my all!

270
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm going to give it my all!
Yawara-san!

271
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,590
Yawara-san!

272
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,260
Yawara-san! Something's up!

273
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,960
What's wrong, Kohno-kun?

274
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,550
As I said, something's up!

275
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,610
A l.. large woman is.. this f.. foreigner..!

276
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,080
Well, she eats five, big helpings of ramen and..!

277
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,270
What are you guys talking about?

278
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,810
Calm down and start from the top.

279
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,120
W.. well, this foreigner woman that eats 
five helpings of ramen is waiting
in the dojo in her judo uniform.

280
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,410
She's saying your name, Yawara-san, 
but since it's in English, we have 
no idea what she's saying.

281
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,020
U.. umm..

282
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,420
"Wh.. where do you come from?"

283
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,320
Eh, what did she say?

284
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,740
Seems like she said she's from Canada.

285
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,800
Oh!

286
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,780
She understood!

287
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,010
Way to go!

288
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,020
She's still here.

289
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,660
There, Yawara-san. Her.

290
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,860
Who is she?

291
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,920
Don't know.

292
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,760
What should we say next?

293
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,600
What should we say next?
I don't know. Something 
about Canada, maybe?

294
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,570
I don't know. Something 
about Canada, maybe?

295
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,750
Yawara.

296
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,380
Y.. yes?

297
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,920
U.. umm. Hello?

298
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,920
Wh.. what did she say?

299
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,510
Uh... Tatakaimashou... 'Let's fight.'

300
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,960
Let's fight?!

301
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,990
Eh? No way!

302
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,480
Matsuda-san.

303
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,770
I don't know what, but I have this feeling 
that something's going to happen.

304
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,800
My hunch was right!

305
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,960
As one of the key, world-class athletes, 
she must've gotten restless...

306
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,250
...from reading my articles and the mass
media's coverage of Yawara-san.

307
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,790
Who is she?

308
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,080
Her name is Jody Rockwell.

309
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,300
She's the world's over-72 kg defender.

310
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,960
And she recently won the World Women's 
Judo Competition in Sydney, Australia.

311
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,060

312
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,780
Yawara Inokuma. I came all this way
from Canada to see you.

313
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,820
Come on, let's fight.

314
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,290
U.. umm..

315
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,170
So, Matsuda-san, this means..

316
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,830
Yeah. She came all the way to 
Japan to fight Yawara-san.

317
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,880
Splendid! Splendid! Tres bien!

318
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,230
Sayaka-san is fired up. 
Fired up more than ever!

319
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,300
No matter how many there are in the world...

320
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,290
... I shall be the one to defeat Inokuma Yawara!

321
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,490
Tanomou, Inokuma Yawara! 
[Tanomou -- I challenge you!]

322
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,980
U.. umm..

323
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,990
What should I do?

324
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,680
866 Days to the Barcelona Olympics

325
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,990
Oh my gosh, Grandpa!

326
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,610
This weird foreigner came and..

327
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,810
D.. delicious!

328
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,340
This horse mackerel is pretty tasty.

329
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,110
Where did you get this, Yawara?

330
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,550
Where did you get this, Yawara?
Forget that!

331
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,550
Forget that!

332
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,190
Look, she even came to our house!

333
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,570
Oh, hey Jodei or whatever, why don't you 
eat some of what Yawara cooked?

334
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,690
Please, Grandpa!

335
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,680
