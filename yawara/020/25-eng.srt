1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,600
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,900
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,400
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,450
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,850
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,400
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,350
I appreciate the thought, okay?

10
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,770
Kazamatsuri-san!

11
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,630
Let's take your friend to eat out with us..

12
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:02,520
Love, Exam Studies, and Yawara's Feelings

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,460
What's happening?

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
O.. Oh!

15
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,970
Well, Yawara-san is at Kazamatsuri-san's 
place again.

16
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,690
Darnit, that Kazamatsuri!

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,570
Just because he's a little good at English..!

18
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,230
Matsuda-san, is this really sports coverage?

19
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,360
Seems more to me like the thing 
you hate -- a celebrity stakeout.

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,540
Seems more to me like the thing 
you hate -- a celebrity stakeout.
Kamoda.

21
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,260
Kamoda.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,750
Good job. It's my turn now.

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,320
Geez, when it's about Yawara-san, your job and personal feelings get so mixed up.

24
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,890
The safety of the superstar of 
the century is in question!


25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,210
This is an outright news coverage!

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,080
What the heck are you thinking, anyway?

27
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,940
Good evening, Sayaka-san.

28
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,550
Well, what a coincidence!

29
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,970
It's going to be an interesting night!

30
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,540
Oh yes! We should all go out to dinner!

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,290
I recently found a great restaurant.

32
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,720
How about it, Sayaka-san?

33
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,060
You're such a DOROBO-NEKO.
[Dorobo-neko -- cat thief]

34
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,760
You want someone else's thing that badly?

35
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,730
How immoral!

36
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,720
I was just...

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,320
Yes, she couldn't study at her house, so I offered to tutor her in my room, that's all.


38
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,080
What an obvious lie.

39
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,820
So you want Kazamatsuri-san, 
no matter what?

40
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,540
That's not what I wanted to do.

41
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,230
Now listen carefully.

42
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,900
Kazamatsuri-san will graduate soon and become part of the Hon'ami Group.

43
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,420
In an executive position, too.

44
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,330
Do you know why?


45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,060
It's because he'll take over the 
Hon'ami Group someday.

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,740
Taking over Hon'ami Group... 
you know why that is, right?

47
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,180
It's because Kazamatsuri-san is my fiance!

48
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,630
Fiance?

49
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,770
Well, actually...

50
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,090
So, no matter what you do with Kazamatsuri-san, it's of no use.

51
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,600
Kazamatsuri-san.

52
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,450
Thank you for tutoring me.

53
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,780
U.. umm..

54
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,280
Yawara-san.

55
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,050
Goodnight.

56
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,320
Brrr, it's so cold!

57
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,250
Y.. Yawara-san?

58
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,410
Yawara-san, what's wrong?


59
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,470
Wh.. what's wrong, Yawara-san?

60
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,720
Yawara-san?

61
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,000
Yawara-san!

62
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,040
Kazamatsuri, why you...!

63
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,160
What did you do to Yawara-san!?

64
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,460
Oh, the third-rate newspaper reporter.

65
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,140
Hon'ami Sayaka! You were here, too?

66
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,720
Your girlfriend is quite a girl.

67
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,510
Quite a girl?

68
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,290
Wh.. what the heck is that?

69
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,130
Kazamatsuri-san, I won't tell
Daddy about today.

70
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,210
But, don't ever get lured by her again. 
Please keep your guard up.

71
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,860
Well then, goodbye.

72
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,200
Kazamatsuri!

73
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,160
What did you do to Yawara-san?

74
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,720
She was crying!

75
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,550
I don't need to discuss private matters 
with newspaper reporters.

76
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,830
Y.. You better not have done anything heinous!

77
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,170
How rude! I'm not that kind of guy!

78
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,930
Besides, with Sayaka-san here, 
I couldn't have possibly done that!

79
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,980
You sure?

80
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,980
I'm sure!

81
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,440
You really sure?

82
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,890
Really sure!

83
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,200
You really really sure?

84
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,130
Enough!

85
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,030
Anyway, this has nothing to do with you. 
Go home! Goodbye!

86
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,070
W.. wait up!

87
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,320
Darnit...!

88
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,600
Kazamatsuri-san..

89
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,540
Kazamatsuri-san..

90
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,420
Kazamatsuri-san, you were 
Sayaka-san's fiance?

91
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,050
Seishin-kan Women's Judo Cup

92
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,550
Ippon! 
[Ippon -- Victory!]

93
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,690
Ippon!

94
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Ippon!

95
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,690
Champion! Inokuma Yawara, 1st Degree, won this tournament with all ippon victories!

96
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,980
Well, at least she won, but..

97
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,190
..I don't recall teaching her such reckless judo!



98
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,660
Inokuma-san, you're incredible!

99
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,120
Since your debut, you've won 
7 tournaments so far!

100
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,470
You're on a roll!

101
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,950
Are you going to run straight
to the Barcelona Olympics?

102
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,110
I don't really care about the Olympics..

103
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,780
You're now invincible in Japan.

104
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,270
Is the world the next level --

105
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:32,780
Is the world the next level --
I won't let you do that.

106
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,930
I won't let you do that.

107
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,380
Ho.. Hon'ami Sayaka!

108
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,860
Sayaka-san.

109
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,080
I've let Inokuma-san run loose a bit too long.

110
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,780
So I entered the next tournament.

111
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,040
Enjoy this moment, it won't last much longer.

112
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Will it be her revenge for the 
Martial Arts Hall Defeat!?

113
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,900
Will it be her revenge for the 
Martial Arts Hall Defeat!?
Hon'ami Sayaka's 
Bold Challenge 
to the 
Undefeated
Inokuma Yawara

114
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,100
That Miss sure is something!

115
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,860
"After the around-the-world training
tour, Inokuma Yawara isn't 
intimidating enough," it says.

116
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,970
Talk about confidence! But, 
that upfront confidence!

117
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,500
I really like that about that Miss.

118
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,490
Yawara! You can learn a lot from her attitude!

119
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,050
Grandpa, hurry up and eat.

120
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,490
I need to go take a practice exam.

121
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh, what is this?

122
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,610
She said that she'd take revenge 
and defeat you in under a minute!

123
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,530
If you're not going to eat,
then I'm clearing the table.

124
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,850
Hold it!

125
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,040
Yawara! You aren't thinking clearly these days.


126
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,920
You're so into the newspaper that you 
haven't touched your breakfast yet!

127
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,260
Nope. I'm not just talking about now.

128
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,620
Even in yesterday's matches, you were 
doing some reckless throws.

129
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,860
No, I was doing okay in those matches.

130
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,010
You're having boy problems, aren't you?

131
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,780
Gulp!

132
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,610
Gotcha, didn't I? It shows clearly on your face.

133
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,600
No, it doesn't, Grandpa. 
What are you talking about?

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,000
No, it doesn't, Grandpa. 
What are you talking about?
Are you troubled by that KazaMIDORI?

135
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,110
Are you troubled by that KazaMIDORI?

136
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,140
Are you troubled by that KazaMIDORI?
KazaMI--? It's Kazamatsuri-san!

137
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,970
KazaMI--? It's Kazamatsuri-san!

138
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,020
Kazamatsuri, KazaMIDORI, same difference!

139
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,590
Stop! Quit worrying about that kind of guy!

140
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:43,530
He turns to you, then turns to Miss Sayaka, and maybe many other girls, too.

141
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,780
That's a perfect KazaMIDORI for you! 
[KazaMIDORI -- weather vane]

142
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,390
Kazamatsuri-san has nothing to do with this!


143
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,130
Forget him.

144
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,150
Just think about your upcoming 
match against Hon'ami Sayaka.

145
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,960
Don't underestimate that Miss' tenacity.

146
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,870
Geez!

147
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
Decide if you're gonna eat or read!

148
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,910
I'm leaving soon.

149
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,550
You talk just like your dead grandma, 
my beloved Kaneko.

150
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,080
Geez..

151
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,120
Jody!

152
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,980
Wh.. why are you so loud?

153
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,860
Grandpa, look!

154
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,400
Jody's match against the Soviet team
is going to be televised today!

155
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Jody's match against the Soviet team
is going to be televised today!
Canada vs. Soviet, Montreal Invitational (live)

156
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,540
Jody's match against the Soviet team
is going to be televised today!

157
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,120
So it is!

158
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,650
I can't wait to see this!

159
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,510
No!

160
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,130
This is the first time I've had
so much fun doing judo!

161
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,910
Please, fight me, Yawara!

162
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,540
Yawara, please!

163
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,840
Jody..

164
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,480
Yawara!

165
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,080
This is the first time I've ever had fun, too.

166
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,090
When your arm is healed, 
let's fight again, okay?

167
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,670
At a competition somewhere.

168
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,140
Really?

169
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,120
Yes.

170
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,850
Jody..

171
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,100
My head is pounding.

172
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,150
Every time I take a practice exam, 
I lose even more confidence.

173
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,630
How'd you do, Yawara?

174
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,650
Horrible.

175
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,470
Well, let's go play around for a change!

176
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,970
Let's go eat a huge cake!

177
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,590
I need to go straight home.

178
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,080
A date, right?

179
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,310
You're having a date with Kazamatsuri-san, right Yawara?

180
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,420
Kazamatsuri-san?

181
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,210
Kazamatsuri-san is my fiance.

182
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,590
No, that's not it.

183
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,940
Oh, it's alright.


184
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,030
During the desolate exam-study season,
you need to have that kind of oasis.

185
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,060
I want a heart-fluttering oasis like that, too.


186
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,950
That's not what I'm doing! I need 
to watch something on TV --

187
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,290
That's not what I'm doing! I need 
to watch something on TV --
Hey!

188
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:31,400
Hey!

189
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,430
Matsuda-san.

190
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,170
I was waiting for you.

191
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,620
You know about today's TV coverage of 
the Canada vs. Soviet match, right?

192
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,420
I wanted to get a comment from you.

193
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,280
Me?

194
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:49,990
Yeah. I didn't feature this yet, 
but in tomorrow's headline...

195
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,740
It's gonna read, "Jody Rockwell And 
Inokuma Yawara Are Destined Rivals!"

196
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,560
What?

197
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,350
Yawara, you're going to date HIM today?

198
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,600
You gave up on Kazamatsuri-san 
and went for THAT guy?

199
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,450
THAT guy?

200
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,700
What do you mean by "THAT guy"? Huh?

201
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:07,770
What do you mean by "THAT guy"? Huh?
I am not going out with THIS kind of guy.

202
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,860
I am not going out with THIS kind of guy.

203
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,630
THIS kind of guy?

204
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,150
I see, Yawara.

205
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,860
You got dumped by Kazamatsuri-san and recklessly went out with him, right?

206
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,630
You need to take better care of yourself.


207
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,470
They're not pulling any punches, are they?

208
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,710
Yawara-san!

209
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,160
Kazamatsuri-san.

210
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,790
Yawara-san, I apologize for the other day.

211
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,860
I wanted to make it up to you today.

212
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,930
Make it up?

213
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,950
Don't tell me you really did 
something to her the other day!

214
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,580
You again?

215
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,370
I told you that this was a private matter.

216
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,040
Let's go, Yawara-san.

217
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,290
W.. wait now!

218
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,400
Excuse us.

219
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,870
Wait!

220
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,610
Darnit!

221
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,920
Y.. Yawara-san!

222
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,880
Yawara-san, where do you think 
you're going with Kazamatsuri?

223
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,360
Aren't you going to watch today's match?

224
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,300
It's Jody's match. You gotta watch it!

225
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,420
Jody's match! The girl that got you 
fired up for the first time!

226
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,880
Don't you understand?

227
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,810
You better watch it!

228
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,570
Darnit!

229
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,890
Y.. Yawara-san, watch Jody's match!

230
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,930
You better watch it!

231
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,230
I'd love to meet her in private, too.

232
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Are you mad about the other day?

233
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,610
Not really..

234
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,350
The executive position in the Hon'ami Group, as Sayaka-san said, is true.

235
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,960
But, it has nothing to do with 
my relationship with her.

236
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,860
Yawara-san, your presence in my 
heart gets bigger all the time..

237
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,600
..ever since I first met you.


238
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,040
So, I didn't want you to misunderstand anything, like that incident the other day.

239
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,630
Kazamatsuri-san.

240
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,210
I don't want to mislead you.

241
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,780
Do you understand?

242
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes.

243
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,370
Thank you.

244
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,360
Well then, I should take you 
to a nice restaurant.

245
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,400
It hasn't been covered in a magazine yet, 
but the chocolate cake is delicious.

246
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,950
It's Jody's match! You gotta watch it!

247
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,320
After that, how about a movie?

248
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,150
You need to have a little fun now and then.

249
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,800
I.. need to watch Jody's match.

250
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,480
Huh?

251
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,860
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,180
Oh. It's okay.

253
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,720
Then, I'll give you a ride home.

254
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,180
But, I won't make it home in time like this...

255
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,730
Then, I'll see you later.

256
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,850
I'm sorry for having to turn you down.

257
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,050
Please don't worry about it.

258
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,820
But promise to meet with me next time, okay?

259
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,780
Yes.

260
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,700
Goodbye.

261
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,530
Take care.

262
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,840
I'm home!

263
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,910
Grandpa, Jody's match. The match!

264
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,550
It's about to start.

265
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,690
Anyway, Yawara. Where have you been?

266
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,460
You're smiling from ear to ear.

267
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,940
N.. no, I'm not.

268
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,000
You were probably fooling around 
with a guy, weren't you?

269
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,560
All during Jody's important world championship too, you fool!

270
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,430
I did not --


271
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,550
This is the Canada vs. Soviet Invitational Match, held in Montreal, Canada.

272
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,780
Last year's 72kg and over class, 
world champion defender, 
Jody Rockwell, from Canada.

273
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,150
Jody!

274
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,680
And, appearing out of nowhere, 
the Soviet Women's Judo's secret 
weapon, Anna Teleshikova.

275
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,920
Begin!

276
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,170
Go for it, Jody!

277
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,950
Rockwell went for a tai-otoshi! 
[tai-otoshi -- body drop]

278
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,300
She got it!

279
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,050
Th.. this..!

280
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,670
What happened?

281
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,210
After losing her balance from an attempted tai-otoshi, Rockwell hasn't gotten up yet. [tai-otoshi -- body drop]

282
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,740
The referees have stopped the 
time to examine the situation.

283
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,040
Did an accident occur?

284
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,630
It's no accident!

285
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,690
Didn't anyone see that Tele-whatever do that?

286
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,420
What?

287
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,130
Let's see the replay.


288
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,130
Rockwell goes for the tai-otoshi. 
[tai-otoshi -- body drop]

289
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,150
Right here, she loses her balance and..

290
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,950
Oh!

291
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,870
Rockwell's left knee is bent the opposite way!

292
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,180
Jody!

293
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,020
What is that announcer looking at?

294
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,910
She didn't lose her balance!

295
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,330
That Tele-whatever kicked
Jodei's supporting foot!

296
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,700
Oh wow, Rockwell is standing up. Is she okay?

297
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,380
What? Jodei's left knee tendon should 
have been completely snapped off.


298
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,990
A normal person would be
convulsing right now.

299
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,710
Oh no, they should stop the match!

300
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,290
No, Jody! Don't fight with that leg!

301
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,570
The match continues.

302
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,060
Begin!

303
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,370
Whoa!

304
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,580
Teleshikova went straight for the 
injured knee for an oo-soto gari! 
[oo-soto gari -- large outer reap]

305
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,410
Stop it! Stop it already!

306
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,990
You're too soft, Yawara!

307
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,300
This is what a real fight involves!

308
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,650
Ippon! 
[Ippon -- Victory!]

309
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,740
Jody!

310
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,000
How disturbing!

311
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,720
Jody Rockwell has been defeated!

312
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:41,030
Soviet's Anna Teleshikova beat the world-champ defender, Rockwell, 
with an oo-soto gari ippon victory! 
[oo-soto gari -- large outer reap]

313
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,980
Don't tell me she calculated 
every move for this win!

314
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,620
What a sight.

315
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,660
Rockwell is totally immobile.

316
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,430
She's being taken away in a stretcher.

317
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,050
Jody! Jody!

318
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,950
