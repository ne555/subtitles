1
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,670
kuchibiruni melody itsushika kizamu yuugure.

2
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,020
Machi o mioroseba kimi no sugata mieru.

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:38,420
Akirame kirenai. Yume no kakera sutenaide!

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,670
Mooichido sono mune atatame naoshiteyo.

5
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,220
Koosaten no hito no nagare. 
Ima, dare, doko, nani shiteru?

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:02,320
Suna no naka no daiyamondo
Sagasu mitaina tokimeki!

7
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,670
kiseki wa itsudemo kimi no heart shidai.

8
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,120
Hitomi no negai wa itsuka kanawu hazuyoo.

9
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,830
My rather tasteless and gloomy high school life.

10
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,800
But from within that darkness, 
you seem to shine so brilliantly.

11
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,550
You keep getting farther away from me.

12
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,880
If I could only watch from afar..

13
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,130
..forever and ever.

14
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:16,040
The Madonna of my Youth, Yawara

15
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,590
Yawara goofed again.

16
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,890
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,470
It's so strange that she's supposed
to be a genius judo girl.

18
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,800
But, it's farewell to judo.

19
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,430
Yawara's going to be a glamorous
college girl soon.

20
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,620
Farewell to bad-looking uniforms!

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,490
We're going to find a great guy, too!

22
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,040
I.. Inokuma..

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,330
Hanazono-kun.

24
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:41,860
Yes?

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,940
I.. Inokuma!

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,540
H.. hi! Fancy meeting you here!

27
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,790
Umm, the ball.

28
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,910
Oh.

29
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,830
Yawara-chan, you got some time?

30
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,230
Sudoh-kun.

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,650
If you don't go out with me today,
I won't give the ball back.

32
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:02,910
If you don't go out with me today,
I won't give the ball back.
Sudoh!

33
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,680
Sudoh!

34
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,400
I can't.

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,490
I'm busy studying for exams.

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,420
Sudoh-kun, you should be busy, too, training for the upcoming fall rookie tournament.

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,490
Kohno-kun and the others are working 
hard to get past the second round, right?


38
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,850
If only you'd coach us, Yawara-chan,
I'd train seriously.

39
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,110
Especially with heavy ne-waza training. [ne-waza -- groundwork]

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,050
Sudoh!

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,780
How can you say such an absolutely disgusting and extremely shameless thing to her!

42
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,170
I can't forgive you!

43
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,170
I give up!


44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,930
You need to take care of yourself, Hanazono-kun.

45
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,470
It's an important time for you, too.

46
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,320
Huh?

47
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,880
Th.. thank you, Inokuma!

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,660
I'm deeply touched by your kind words!


49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,810
Be deeply touched by yourself.

50
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,600
I need to go see Yawara-chan.

51
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,170
Hey, be deeply touched, too!

52
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,620
Hey, be deeply touched, too!
I.. am!

53
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,000
I.. am!

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,020
I.. am!
Hanazono

55
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,950
Hanazono

56
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,450
Certain victory

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,700
Math

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,150
Aim for Saikai College!

59
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,650
No, no! I have to concentrate!

60
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,670
Inokuma Yawara-sama

61
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,680
Inokuma Yawara-sama
Inokuma, I vowed to only see you from afar...

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:34,900
Inokuma Yawara-sama

63
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,650
...but just like this small drawer, my heart is overflowing with so much feelings for you.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, Inokuma residence.

65
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,550
Sudoh-kun?


66
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,980
I figured you were disappointed by someone interfering in our affairs, Yawara-chan.

67
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,640
So, how about a date on Sunday tomorrow,
at 10AM? Just the two of us?

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,920
I said I can't.

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,000
I said I can't.
Yawara!

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
Yawara!

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,830
Grandpa.

72
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,690
It's from that flirt, KazaMIDORI, isn't it?
I won't allow it!

73
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,900
You have plans for tomorrow already. 
I'll reject him for you!

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,010
This has nothing to do with you, Grandpa.

75
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,890
You're going to Saikai College 
with me tomorrow!

76
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,030
I am not!

77
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,150
I am not!
Yes, you are!

78
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,990
Yes, you are!

79
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,810
Geez!

80
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,380
Okay, I'll go on a date with you tomorrow.

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,560
Yawara!

82
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,900
R.. really?

83
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,840
I'll see you in front of the Hachiko
dog statue at 10AM.

84
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,060
Yawara-chan actually likes me!

85
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,470
I'm so happy!

86
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,090
Oh shoot...

87
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,560
Huh? Wasn't that Sudoh?

88
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,830
Sudoh?

89
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,540
Yawara! I won't allow this!

90
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,890
You're ten years too young to date!

91
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
It's none of your business, Grandpa.


92
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,260
Oh, another phone call.

93
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,130
Hanazono-kun, what's going on?

94
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,430
Hanazono

95
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,500
Hanazono
W.. well, err, how are you?

96
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:08,600
Hanazono

97
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,540
Huh? We just saw each other
at school today. Why?

98
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,940
W.. well, you know...

99
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,400
Inokuma Yawara-sama

100
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,020
..Inokuma, are you available tomorrow?

101
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,420
Tomorrow?

102
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,740
Tomorrow is..

103
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,380
If you have to do something, then that's fine.

104
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,000
Well then...

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,710
Oh, Hanazono-kun, did you want to 
go out somewhere for a change?

106
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,590
What?

107
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,970
Let's go on a date tomorrow.

108
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,740
D.. d.. da.. date!

109
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,440
Yawara!

110
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,030
Don't tell me that you're going
to date that gorilla man!

111
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,250
Grandpa, your blood pressure will rise.

112
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,260
What a screwed up sense of taste in men!

113
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,460
Well, Hanazono-kun, meet you at the
Hachiko dog statue at 10AM, okay?

114
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,760
Y.. yes..

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,860
I'm.. I'm such a fortunate man!

116
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,450
That Yawara. She's getting
brattier by the minute.

117
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,490
I'll make sure she doesn't go on a date today.

118
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,810
Father, breakfast is ready.

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,220
I can't eat now!

120
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,750
Oh really?

121
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,180
The yellowtail teriyaki and dried 
daikon radish came out great...

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,150
Y.. yellowtail teriyaki and dried daikon radish?

123
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,170
Yawara hasn't woken up yet, either.

124
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,260
W.. well, I suppose I should eat.

125
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,990
After all, you can't fight on an empty stomach.


126
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,710
Hanazono-kun.

127
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,880
I.. Inokuma.

128
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,660
Did you have to wait long?

129
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,900
N.. no, I just came, too.

130
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,780
Shall we go, then?

131
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,580
Oh wait.

132
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,170
We have to wait for one more person.

133
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,690
Yawara-chan!

134
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,780
S.. Sudoh!

135
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,670
Huh? Hanazono-san?

136
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,380
Wh.. what are you doing here?

137
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,110
I should ask you the same!

138
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,420
Come on, you guys, let's all have a fun date.

139
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,810
Gosh darnit, I thought I was going
to be with Yawara-chan all night...

140
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,620
...and have morning coffee with her, alone.

141
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:48,200
An absolutely disgusting and 
extremely shameless guy like you 
shouldn't be near Inokuma!

142
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,750
All you're trying to do is get between 
me and Yawara-chan!

143
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,550
How dare you speak to an
upperclassman like that!

144
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,390
Hey, are you guys coming or what?

145
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,680
Yes, coming! Coming!

146
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,240
Wh.. why do I have to sit with you?

147
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,420
Shut up! It's better that way.

148
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,770
Yawara-chan!

149
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,090
And you call yourself a Musashiyama 
Judo Athlete, huh?

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,860
That set and..

151
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,630
Yes, it'll take a moment..

152
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,000
I.. it's my chance.

153
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,490
Now's my chance to express my feelings.

154
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,210
Inokuma --

155
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,770
Inokuma --
Hanazono-kun..

156
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,010
Hanazono-kun..

157
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,260
Are you doing okay with your exam studies?

158
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,720
Y.. yes.

159
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:00,080
Well, I can't be recruited into a college
like you that easily, so I have
to work really hard to get in.

160
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,700
I need to work hard, too.

161
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,940
What am I doing? I.. it's now or never!

162
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm going to learn a lot in the 2-year college, Housekeeping major.

163
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,430
2-year college, Housekeeping major?


164
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,950
I've been trained to do judo
ever since I could remember.

165
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,480
But, there's a lot of things I want to do as a girl.

166
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,150
And, I don't like judo anymore, because it 
gets people hurt and splits up families.

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,020
I want to be a normal girl. Just a normal girl.

168
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,290
Th.. then what about judo?

169
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,510
What?!

170
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,620
No, you can't quit judo!

171
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,090
Hanazono-kun.

172
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,670
Who cares? If that's what Yawara-chan wants.

173
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,810
Right, Yawara-chan?

174
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,930
Sudoh! Are you satisfied with that?

175
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,430
You're supposed to be some 
sort of judo athlete, too!

176
00:10:59,490 --> 00:10:59,960
Heh!

177
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,610
It's not cool to be such an 
intense athlete anymore.

178
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,090
Whatever Yawara-chan does, I'm on her side.

179
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,560
Inokuma has an innate genius ability!

180
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,330
An ability that can't be attained 
through hard work alone!

181
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,950
Inokuma can't quit judo!

182
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,390
Let Yawara-chan do what she wants to.

183
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,330
It's none of your business anyway.

184
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,450
Maybe so, but when..

185
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,750
..when Inokuma shines brilliantly in judo, I.. I..

186
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,050
Hanazono-kun!

187
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
I.. love you like that!

188
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,370
What's he so excited over?

189
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,920
Oh well, that leaves me alone
with Yawara-chan!

190
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,300
Hanazono-kun..

191
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,550
Inokuma..

192
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,910
I'm.. I'm extremely saddened!

193
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,070
Thank you, Sudoh-kun. I had a nice time today.

194
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,010
Going home already? The night's still young.

195
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,760
Why can't we hang out until morning?

196
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,170
I need to study for exams.

197
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,670
You need to go train for
the rookie tournament, too.

198
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,650
Oh, and don't get into any fights and cause trouble for the team like the last time, okay?

199
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, I guess you put me in my place.

200
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,690
Promise me.

201
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,970
See you later.

202
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,890
Bye-bye, Yawara-chan!

203
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,580
Sudoh-chan, we found you!

204
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,910
You seem to be in a good mood, Sudoh.

205
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,630
A.. am I?

206
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,590
I knew there was a reason why a flirt 
like you would join a judo team, but..

207
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,600
..so you were after Yawara, huh?

208
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,820
So you stopped hanging out with us
delinquents and started doing judo 
for a youthful glory, huh?

209
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,710
I'm jealous.

210
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,640
W.. well, I guess.

211
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,250
Enough of your crap!

212
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,020
We aren't gonna let you be a goody 
two-shoes and have fun that easily!

213
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,510
Have fun? I'm getting real close to that...

214
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,870
Bull shit!

215
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,790
If you want to get out of the group, then you'll have to deal with the consequences!

216
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,390
We'll see you at that park at 4PM tomorrow.

217
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,050
Don't even try to run away, otherwise we'll go visit your pathetic little judo club in person.

218
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,420
Okay then. I'll be there.

219
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,070
See you, Sudoh. Don't forget it.

220
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,120
Sudoh.



221
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,480
Come on now!

222
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,390
Hanazono-sempai is rather excited, 
even though he's not going to be
in the rookie tournament.

223
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,370
I wonder why?

224
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,170
Inokuma, I can't believe that 
you're giving up judo.

225
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,600
You need to keep doing judo.

226
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,920
Hey, having fun yet, everyone?

227
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,820
Sudoh!

228
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,440
How dare you come so late, you slacker!

229
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,410
Here you go, Hanazono-san.

230
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,000
Club Retirement Letter

231
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,370
Th.. this is..!

232
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,040
It's a retirement letter!

233
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,330
Are you serious, Sudoh?

234
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,950
Of course I am.

235
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,870
I can't be in such a sad club for long, 
since I might rot here.

236
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,750
Feels so good to quit!

237
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,520
What's going on?

238
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,130
He just joined to get close to Yawara-san!

239
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,220
U.. umm...

240
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,220
And so.. goodbye.

241
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,200
Wait up!

242
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,710
I'm disappointed because you 
had an absolutely disgusting,

243
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,920
and extremely shameless reason
to join and for quitting the club.

244
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,670
Was all the blood, guts, and tears that we shed together in the last eight months just an act?

245
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:42,820
Was judo just a side hobby for you?

246
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,450
Hanazono-san.. and everyone. Farewell.

247
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,820
Darnit! Sudoh...!

248
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,700
Judo Club

249
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,420
Oh, Sudoh-kun?

250
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,870
Sudoh-kun?

251
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,770
Sudoh bowed to the judo club room?

252
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,810
Are you sure, Yawara-san?


253
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,120
That's weird, because he just slapped a retirement letter and left us in the cold.

254
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,580
Sudoh-kun quit the club?


255
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,610
Yes. And with just four of us now, 
we can't enter the rookie tournament.

256
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,420
Umm..

257
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,510
Enough of Sudoh! Forget about him already.

258
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,540
That's not it! I was forced
into silence by Sudoh-kun!

259
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,730
What?

260
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,050
Well...

261
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,960
He's going to take care of his 
old friends, once and for all?

262
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,920
Is he serious?

263
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,120
Of course he is!

264
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,560
He said not to tell anyone, but...
I've never seen him look so serious!

265
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,010
He gave the retirement letter so that his fight won't cause any trouble for the judo club...

266
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,090
...especially before the tournament!

267
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,150
He's really serious about it!

268
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,100
Sudoh-kun is keeping my promise...

269
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,900
We need to go stop him!


270
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,800
Yeah, we do!

271
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,970
Hanazono-sempai!

272
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,010
Sudoh.. you're so..!

273
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,580
Sudoh!

274
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,730
Come on, fight us, Sudoh.

275
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,680
Don't tell me you became 
spineless for Yawara-chan.

276
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,540
Oh yeah, I saw Yawara-chan on TV. 
She's pretty hot!

277
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,570
Especially when her chest gets 
exposed from the ruffled judo outfit!

278
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,370
How dare you say such absolutely disgusting and extremely shameless things...

279
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,640
...just because I haven't stopped you!

280
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,050
Whoa. He's so madly in love with her.

281
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,670
This has nothing to do with Yawara-chan!

282
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,470
I'll pay you guys back with interest!

283
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,620
Heh, just because you can do a little judo, doesn't give you the right to act like a big shot!

284
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,880
It would be a waste to use
judo on cruds like you!

285
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,520
I can beat you guys without it!

286
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,420
Sudoh! Sudoh!

287
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,880
Ha.. Hanazono-sempai.

288
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,580
Wait.. wait up!

289
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,970
It's my responsibility to take
care of my kouhai's matters!

290
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,240
I am Hanazono Kaoru, the Musashiyama
judo team captain!


291
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,980
Please, let him go! I beg you!

292
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,840
Are you stupid? I thought I gave 
you my retirement letter!

293
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,490
We're no longer sempai or kouhai!

294
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,640
I don't remember receiving 
any retirement letters!

295
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,600
Wh.. why'd you do that?

296
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,150
Now you're still an official 
Musashiyama judo team member.

297
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,850
You'll have to be in the upcoming
rookie tournament.

298
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,190
Why'd you have to do that...

299
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,180
What are you doing? You need 
to beg for forgiveness, too!

300
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,050
We wouldn't need cops or the military if 
things were settled with begging, right?

301
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,200
Please, understand our plight.

302
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,660
Hanazono-kun! Sudoh-kun!

303
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,250
Sudoh!

304
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,520
Inokuma!

305
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,660
Yawara-chan!

306
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,330
Don't come, Inokuma. You shouldn't!

307
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,140
Hanazono-kun?

308
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,730
You need to take care of yourself, since 
you're going to get the gold medal...

309
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,250
...at the Barcelona Olympics and 
the National Achievement Award.

310
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,330
You shouldn't get mixed up
with these delinquents!

311
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,390
Sorry for being a delinquent!

312
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,670
We're trying to bear through this thing so Sudoh can continue doing judo!

313
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,820
You're just forcing my head down..!

314
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,520
So, Inokuma, please bear with us, too!

315
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,490
But, I don't really want to do judo anymore...



316
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,360
It's so boring to mess with these mushy fellas.

317
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,780
We should go have some fun 
with Yawara-chan instead.

318
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,550
Don't you guys dare lay a 
finger on Yawara-chan --

319
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,080
Run away, Inokuma!

320
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,410
Ya.. Yawara-san!

321
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,230
I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.

322
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,350
Whoa, take it easy on us, Yawara-chan.

323
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,520
You're so hot when you get mad, too!

324
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
Inokuma!

325
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,260
Yawara!

326
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,300
Grandpa!

327
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,890
Stop wasting your time here!

328
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,300
Since you ditched me yesterday, 
you're doing pre-supper training!

329
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,040
Hey gramps, you're in the way! Shove off!

330
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,520
What!! How dare you do that, 
you insensitive fools!

331
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,720
Young folks these days don't 
value food like we used to.

332
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,290
It was the post-war period...

333
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:18,460
In the rubble of the obliterated Tokyo,
Kaneko and I shared a meager 
bowl of suiton to stave off hunger.

334
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,410
But, what about the present Japan?

335
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,790
What's so great about GOURMET? And FRENCH food? And BEEF-STRONG CONGO! [trying to say beef stroganoff]

336
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,810
We.. we're very sorry!

337
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,170
I'll never forget the taste of that bowl of suiton.

338
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,770
Oh my gosh, Grandpa, why do you have those?



339
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,280
Well, I strongly refused the offer, but Tome-san from the fruit shop told me to take it home!

340
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,950
Th.. this is some hot stuff!

341
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,490
Very stimulating!

342
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,840
Hey, these are mine!

343
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,820
Are you guys okay, Hanazono-kun? Sudoh-kun?


344
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,170
Inokuma, thank you for holding 
yourself back like that.

345
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,660
So you haven't given up judo yet!

346
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm really happy, Inokuma!

347
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,850
Aren't you grateful, Sudoh?

348
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,150
I'm not really --

349
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,230
I'm not really --
Shut up! Don't say anything!

350
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,230
Shut up! Don't say anything!

351
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I know exactly how you feel!

352
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,990
Sudoh, you're so..!

353
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,300
He.. hey, stop it! Please stop it!

354
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,730
Sudoh. Sudoh. Sudoh. Sudoh.

355
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,000
Everyone, Sudoh has returned to our team.

356
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,440
Let's get back to our training
for the rookie tournament!

357
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,460
Let's get back to our training
for the rookie tournament!
Yes!

358
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,970
Yes!

359
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,660
Let's run towards the sunset!

360
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,410
Yes!

361
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,680
Yeah, as if I'm going to hang around and 
do the mushy youthful glory thing.

362
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,400
You come, too!

363
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,250
H.. hey, I don't like doing this kind of thing!

364
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,870
Fight-oh! Fight-oh!

365
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,750
Since you guys are under-age,
I can't lend them to you.

366
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,840
But, I can share the plot with you.

367
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,910
P.. please do so!

368
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,070
Oh! Oh! Oh!

369
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,350
Geez, Grandpa.

370
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:22,820
789 Days to the Barcelona Olympics


371
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,500
With my guidance, I was able to lead 
the lost sheep onto the right path.

372
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,500
What guidance? You borrowed 
such sleazy video tapes.

373
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,530
They forced it onto me! 
It was Zen-san.. no Gen-san...

374
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,460
You're lying.

375
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:41,830
You're lying.
I'm not lying! Zen-san... no, Tome-san...

376
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,220
I'm not lying! Zen-san... no, Tome-san...

377
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,820
