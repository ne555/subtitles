1
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,721
Well, l'm sorry, but I don't want
to drmk with ymu either. But...

2
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:41,434


3
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,520
I have to be drunk to say what. I'm about to say.

4
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,481
Say what? What are you talking about?

5
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,067
It's about Yawaraaa-n.

6
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,442


7
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:55,573
But, Coach Yuutenji, you're very consistent
You've been visiting us every month now.

8
00:01:56,032 --> 00:02:02,872
Well, I've heard that other colleges are trying
to recruit Yawara-san, and that thought has
prevented me from sleeping at night.

9
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,249


10
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,251
Such a small heart for a huge man like you.

11
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,168


12
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:11,172
I, Inukuma Jigoro, stand by my word!
I'll put Yawara in Saikai College,

13
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,134
Yawara has been daunting for Joy, too.

14
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,137


15
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,722
We'l'l, Kazamatsuri-san...

00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,267
It's tough, but good luck with your exam studies.

17
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,729
If you try hard enough, anything will be possible.

18
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,146


19
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,563
Yes.

20
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,237

00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,697


22
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,950
All right, study, study! Fight, Yawara!

23
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,749
That's it,

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,710
Your smile fits you the best.

25
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,682
Mom, has the paperwork for the Mitsuxba Woman's
College entrance exam came yet?

00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,016


27
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,768
I don't think so.

28
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:04,934


29
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:09,022

00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,425


42
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,886

00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,970


44
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,056
How many times do I have to tell you, Grandpa.

45
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:43,390


46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,725

Where did you get such stubbornness from?

51
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,693


52
00:03:54,693 --> 00:04:01,783
If you want to go to that MI-I -HAA college, then
you'll have to kill me and go over my dead body!

53
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,454

Well. don't make such a big deal out of it.

69
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:46,995

enough to do the job.

00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:51,416
I'm just anticipating your ability
to make greater stories.

00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,352

00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,355
It's okay. If you must fondle them, go ahead.

120
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:37,856


121
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,733

126
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:47,907


127
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,410

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:50,535

Dear Yawarra, sorry to worry yau, but

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,519


165
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,983
Kannada-wan, Kamoda-san! Kamo-chan!

166
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:32,364
This is my first time too...
seeing them this close...

167
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:39,579
They're so aggressive, aren't they!? Guys need
to be manly, unlike a Laser I know, huh?

168
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:46,002
I've always wanted m be a sports photographer.

169
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:53,134
So that I could be friends with someone famous,
or be their lover, or even marry one of them!

170
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,094


171
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,553

00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,521


176
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:09,275
How is this fabric?

177
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:09,859

00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:15,865
This prfet-a-porte'r IE the Latest fabric designed
by a famous Milano designer.

...that the engagement is off.
Tell her straight! Straight!

181
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,582


182
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:35,135
When I saw the presentation of this fabric
in Milano, I thought, "Miss Sayaka would
be the best candidate for this."

183
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,473
Oh, but isn't the cost a little on
the cheap side? Right, Sayaka?

184
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,394
Mommy, I don't want that.

185
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,481
I want the type that Princess
Diana ware at the last party.

186
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,818
We have that! We have that!

187
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,487


188
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,574
Isn't this perfect for Miss Sayaka?

189
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:57,741


190
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh, that seems a little too main.

191
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,326


192
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,454
I've seen that everywhere.

193
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:07,042
Ineed to tell her straight. Straight!

194
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,588
Sayaka will be a callege student
at Seishin JyouGakukan.

195
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:19,763
So, as an adult, she'll need more classy and
stylish clothing, right Kazamatsuri-san?

196
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,475
.. ah... I agree!

197
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,605
Eut, we've purchased about  Z outfits
ahready. Are we buying more --

198
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:38,740
Kazamautsuri-san, with just Q outfits, won't
I run out of clnthiwng after u days?

199
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,495
O... ah, I see!

200
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,996


201
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,998
Oh gosh, Kazamatsuri--san!

202
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:47,123
Well, my mistake!
Oh gosh, Kazamatsuri-aan!

203
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,958
Well, my mistake!

204
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:56,883
Oh, Takarnatsuya-san. please tai'lor
m suits for Kammmmri-san, too.

205
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,177
Yes, with pleasure-l

206
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,514
Oh, you don't have to.

207
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:08,353
As my fialncei, we need you to wear
clothing that befits your status.

208
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,979
Oh, no you donT.

209
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,609
If I let them buy those for me, I'll
just fall deeper into their trap.

210
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,819


211
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,113
Oh, isnt this a nice one?

212
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,948


213
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,866
Hey, that's a great one!

214
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,705
This is wonderful, too.

215
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,750
lit is! Wen, thank you very much.

216
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,593
Nope. No good.

217
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,179
What?

218
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,223
Why?

219
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,141


220
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,893
The focus is sharp and the composition
is great, alright.

221
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,060


222
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,023
Aren't they!? I thought they were great too!

223
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,193
But, none of them were exciting-l

224
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:57,610


225
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,570
What's that?

226
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,196


227
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:07,203
Have you ever thought about all the hard training
these athletes dlid until the day of the game?

228
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,247
NopeA

229
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,669
Then I'll show you what a REAL
professional whom looks like!

230
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,170


231
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,338
Hey, Kamodai

232
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,214
Kamoda !

233
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,426


234
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,803
W... well, I'm sorry. I... I...

235
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,347


236
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:25,638


237
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,725
What the hell were you doing?

238
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,275
Geez! So what? What? wrong with my photos?

239
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,362


jj
240
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,823
Ifs simple. You may be a Mdi- haa.
going crazy over nothing.  .

241
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:49,746
...but those athletes trained through sweat
and mud to get to these games!

242
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:55,251
You haven't captured any of their tenacity
nor intensity in your photos!

243
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,881
Gee, you're so loud. Can
you tune it down a tittle?

244
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,341


245
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:06,930
Listen! Since you're working with me, we're
guing to have to follow lvnakuma
Yawaura every day!

246
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,225
I can easily photograph judo!

247
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:10,433


248
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,227
Easi ly?

249
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,314
D... do you have any idea about her?

250
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:16,898


251
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,527
Listen. Her judo isn't your ordinary judo.

252
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:20,735


253
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:25,824
Ever since she could remember, she:
been training and polishing her skill-s!

254
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,744
But, she shines brilliantly
m a single. brief moment!

255
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:39,004
When this rather normal, average g-iri makes
the move, everything comes together,
and her great brilliance shines through!

256
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:45,844
With a half-assed camera work like yours,
you can't capture that moment!

257
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,014
Ma... Matsuda-san, that's too harsh.

258
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,106


259
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,524
Hey, enough already!

260
00:14:59,524 --> 00:14:59,691


261
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,191
What the hell?

262
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:00,400
So damn noisy with her crying!
What the hell?

263
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,485
So damn noris-y with her crying!

264
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:09,034
L... let's go talk about this
over tea! Come, come!

265
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,121
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,667
I've never been scolded so harih-Iy.

267
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,001
Well, I went too far.
I've never been scolded so harih-Iy.

268
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,170
Well, I went too far.

269
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,965
I seem to get too serious when
it's about Yawara-san.

270
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,259
Is she that great?

271
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,552
on yeah:

272
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:32,640
It's not often that you see a giirl
shine so bri'lilaanvtly like that!

273
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:33,975
So yau like her?

274
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,314
You like Yawara-san?

275
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,566
Wh... what are you saying?

276
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:48,365
l... I'm just interested in her as
a news reporter. That's all!

277
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,463
Such a tear-jerking Ietter'

278
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,176
What's wrong, Grandpa?

279
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,971
The more I read it, the more Fm moved by it.

280
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,430


281
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,139
What is?

282
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,312
This is my letter from Jody!

283
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,564
Yawara, you have such a great rivaL

284
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,900
You snuck into my room again!

285
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:29,406
Grandpa, even you aren't allowed
to read my personal letters!

286
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:29,823


287
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:34,494
"Jody-san, never give up, for
l, Jigoro, am there for you."

288
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,078


289
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,122
Oops, I just had to write a poem about it.

290
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,248


291
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,541
Grandpa:

292
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,460
Listen up, Yawaral

293
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,212
What?

294
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,508
Reading that letter has moved me deeply.

295
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:57,892
Jody's intense feelings for judo and her strong
desire to fight you again pours
out from this letter.

296
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:58,018


297
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,022
We can't just sit here after getting this
letter. You need to do a tournament!

298
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,608
Well, I don't think so.

299
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,904
I only have M days until the awn-trance exam.

300
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,949
I already gigned you up for one.

301
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,451
What?

302
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:14,868


303
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:19,414
Wh... why are you atways so selfish?

304
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,500
Who's the selfish one here?

305
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:28,465
Yawara, Jody is trying so hard to recover,
so that she can fight you one day.

306
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,384
Afmr reading that letter, arenW:
you the least but moved?

307
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,681
l"m moved. And she; a great rivaL

308
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:41,936
But, with such a big injury, will
she ever be able to recover?

309
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,566
Oh, she will. Jody will surely recover in no time.

310
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:54,324
But until then, you need to build a record to
be able to enter world-class tournaments.

311
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:54,574



312
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:59,829
But, what are you doing? You've been spacing
out and skipping so many practices.

313
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,747


314
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,957
You're going to do this tournament!

315
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,084


316
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,170
I need to study far the exam.
I dom't have time for that.

317
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,712


318
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,423
I don't have the luxury to be in a tournament.

319
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,472
Okay then. I'll allow you to take the entrance
exam for that women's college.

320
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,186
Really?

321
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,189
A judo athlete stands by his words.

322
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,442
But, you need to be in the tournament for that!

323
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,988
Real-ly? If I do the tournament, then I can
go to Mitsuba Z-Year Women's College?

324
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,573
Enough already.

325
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,575
Thank you, Grandpa!

326
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:44,958
To tell yau the truth, I was unsasy about going
to Mitsuba College without your approval.

327
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,545
Now I can concentrate can
studying! This is so great!

328
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,505
Thank you, Grandpa!

329
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,849
I've agreed to Ian her take the exam, but I havenht
agreed to let her avttand the collage.

330
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:07,772
I took care of aall the paperwork for her
admittance into Saikaui College
as a schularshilp athlete.

331
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:15,321
Gosh, I gained more weight.

332
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,740
What, you too, Kaari?

333
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,074
So you mean...

334
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,453
Yeah, I gained a little, also.

335
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,163
Oh, really?

336
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,040
I know what you mean.

337
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:30,545
Studying so tats makes you want to reach
far midnight snacks and stuff.

338
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,548
Mantsundawsan .

339
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,508
Hi.

340
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,301
What are you here for?

341
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:36,885
You're so persistscm.
What are you here for?

342
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:37,802
You're so persistent.

343
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,188
I'm not interviewing you today.

344
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,691
I suppose it's sort of a periodic check-up.

345
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,652
I guess newspaper raponers
have lots of time tn spare.

346
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,241
How are your studies going?

347
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,451
Oikay.

348
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,330
And, I have Grandpa's approval to go
to Miisuba ZNear Women's Collage.

349
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,122
What?

350
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:12,337
We-ll, I ll be! Wasn't he so set on
getting you into Saiikaj College?

351
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,757
Now I can fully concentrate an exam studies.

352
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,969
I onry have two more weeks,
so I need to do my best!

353
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,972
Did you wait long?

354
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,271
I'm ao starry I m ma

355
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:37,612
Oh. aren't you lnokuma Yaw-era?
We seen you on TV before.

356
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:43,576
He's constantly taking about
you. even during our data.

357
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,121
Right, Kousaku?

358
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,372
Kousaku?

359
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,874
Date?

360
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,334


361
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,961
W... wait a minute!
