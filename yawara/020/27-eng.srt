1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,550
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,350
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,500
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,800
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,300
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,220
"He told me to hurry up."

10
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,240
Okay, this will be on the exam.

11
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,140
The structure of this sentence is S+V+O+O.

12
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,110
The second O is to. Okay then,
Katto, please read.

13
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:58,330
Thank you for attending my birthday party.

14
00:01:59,390 --> 00:01:59,920
This snail is delicious!

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,750
This snail is delicious!
Grandpa!

16
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:00,950
Grandpa!

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,660
We have great news, also.

18
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,870
Kazamatsuri-kun, please come here.

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,670
Kazamatsuri-san?

20
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,090
Our only daughter, Sayaka, and Kazamatsuri-kun...

21
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,270
..are now engaged!

22
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,770
I need to work hard.

23
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,890
Entrance exam studying is the
only thing going for me.

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,350
Only the exam studies.

25
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,970
Yawara and the Love Square

26
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,930
What? Special admittance to that college?

27
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,740
I'm sorry for hiding it from you guys!

28
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,440
But I didn't think I'd get it.


29
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,570
Th.. that's so unfair for only you to 
escape from this exam study hell.

30
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,730
Hey, say something to her, Yawara and Kazumi.

31
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,380
A.. actually, me too.

32
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,840
What?

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,050
For the longest time, I've been trying to decide between college and hair-dressing school.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,010
But, I made my decision.

35
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,840
No way.

36
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,440
Kazumi, you've never mentioned this before!


37
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,250
It was kinda hard to bring it up.

38
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,260
I.. I can't believe it!

39
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,890
Is that all our female friendship amounted to?

40
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,460
I thought we were supposed to go through
this entrance exam hell together.

41
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,820
I'm really sorry.

42
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,450
I'll buy you a chocolate parfait.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,340
And once I become a pro hair dresser, 
I'll set your hair for you!

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,650
Why should I? Not even.

45
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,190
Sorry.

46
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,020
But, I'm happy for both of you, 
Kyoko and Kazumi.

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,620
Congratulations.

48
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,910
Kyoko and Kazumi seemed so happy.

49
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,290
Feels like I'm the only one left behind.

50
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,320
It's so frustrating.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,550
Hi!

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,270
Hon'ami Sayaka's Shocking Engagement Announcement!! 
Her Judo Coach is her Fiance!

53
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,970
Hon'ami Sayaka's Shocking Engagement Announcement!! 
Her Judo Coach is her Fiance!
He's basically marrying into fortune.

54
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,750
Hon'ami Sayaka's Shocking Engagement Announcement!! 
Her Judo Coach is her Fiance!

55
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,860
Kazamatsuri's main objective for being 
her coach was to do that.

56
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,790
What a low-life..

57
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,980
What a low-life..
He's not that kind of person!

58
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,170
He's not that kind of person!

59
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,520
Then what kind is he?

60
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,350
He's been approaching you while
this has been going on.

61
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,790
I was the only one thinking that there 
was something going on between 
me and Kazamatsuri-san.

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,430
Regardless, Kazamatsuri-san 
isn't a bad person.

63
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,300
He was really nice to me.

64
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,710
Why are you SOOO nice about it?

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,990
Making girls think like that is his technique!

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,740
He's a playboy!

67
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,410
No he's not!


68
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,770
Besides, why are you concerned
about this anyway?

69
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm just trying to rescue you
from that evil creature..

70
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,780
What evil creature?

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,340
A.. anyway, forget him pronto.

72
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,690
That's the best thing for you to do.

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
I...

74
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,600
I...

75
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,310
..want to forget him, too.

76
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,630
O.. okay!

77
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,780
Let's go have some fun!

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,340
Tomorrow will be a new starting point.

79
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,010
You can work on finding a new love.

80
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,760
Right? Right? Right?

81
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,630
You've been sighing so much.

82
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,490
Unusual for a recently engaged man.

83
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,720
As I said, I was trapped into that!

84
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,180
Yeah, sure.

85
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,650
Her parents decided to make me 
marry her when she graduated 
from college without my consent.

86
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,870
I can't stand that I have to be tied 
down as her fiance until then.

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,660
I can't stand being the other woman.

88
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,860
As I said, I was trapped into that!

89
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,740
You really sure?

90
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,450
I'm really really sure.

91
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,290
You're the woman of my dreams.

92
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,420
So "Yawara-san" is the REAL woman you want?

93
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,070
Did I say that?

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,060
While you were sleeping.

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,500
Then there's Hiromi-san,
Mayumi-san, and Mieko-san...

96
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,140
Ah! No! I'll get that!

97
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,570
Yes, this is Kazamatsuri.

98
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,140
This is Sayaka.

99
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,860
I'm going to go shopping. 
Will you be able to go?

100
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,490
Err, well, actually, today, uhh...

101
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,580
Then we're on our way to pick you up.

102
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,420
Well then.

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,460
Sorry, but can you leave now?

104
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,180
What? I thought I could spend the night here!

105
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,990
That's okay. Hurry up and leave. Okay? Okay?

106
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,090
Gee, skating is so hard.

107
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,310
Hey, what's wrong, Yawara-san? 
Hurry up and come over here!

108
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,540
Hey, what's wrong, Yawara-san? 
Hurry up and come over here!
Hey, wait for me!

109
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:32,840
Hey, wait for me!

110
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,230
Hey, wait for me!
Come here!

111
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,680
Come here!

112
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,020
Watch out!

113
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,850
Yawara-san.

114
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Look!

115
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,650
These melon rice cakes are superb!

116
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,880
N.. no, no! I've had plenty already!

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,320
Such a small appetite for a huge man like you.

118
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,980
Well, when I was younger, I used to eat 8 helpings, but these days, I'm down to 5 helpings.

119
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,100
But, Coach Yuutenji, you're very consistent.

120
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,340
You've been visiting us every month now.


121
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,090
Well, I've heard that other colleges have 
been trying to recruit Yawara-san...

122
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,520
...so that thought has prevented 
me from sleeping at night.

123
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,090
Such a small heart for a huge man like you.

124
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,000
I, Inokuma Jigoro, stands by his promise!

125
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,170
I'm going to put Yawara in Saikai College.

126
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,170
Yawara has been dancing for joy, too.

127
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,580
Thank you very much --

128
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,970
Thank you very much --
I haven't been dancing for joy!

129
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,590
I haven't been dancing for joy!

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,760
Yawara-san.

131
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,900
You're late! Late, Yawara!

132
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,230
Where and what have you been doing?

133
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,960
Studying for exams with friends, of course.

134
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
S.. studying for exams?

135
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,340
But I thought Yawara-san was 
going to Saikai College?

136
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,980
I'm not going to Saikai Coll --

137
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,270
I'm not going to Saikai Coll --
Whoa!

138
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,780
Whoa!

139
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,710
Excuse us!

140
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,630
What type of ridiculous
nonsense are you saying?

141
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,330
You're the one saying ridiculous
nonsense, Grandpa!

142
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,960
I said it a million times that I am
NOT going to Saikai College!

143
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,000
Eii, don't give me that!

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,130
Eii, don't give me that!
I said I'm not going!

145
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,460
I said I'm not going!

146
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,940
Not in this life time!

147
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,330
Not in this life time!
Hey wait, you be-bopping delinquent child!

148
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,850
Hey wait, you be-bopping delinquent child!

149
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,630
Here you are. Thank you for waiting.

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,520
Oh, are you feeling ill, Yuutenji-san?

151
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,390
Your face is rather pale.

152
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,240
Another day wasted, being 
stuck with Sayaka-san.

153
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,110
If Sayaka-san keeps controlling
me like this.. oh no!

154
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,090
Master, seconds!

155
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,150
Here you go.

156
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,980
Come on, what is it? 
You wanted to talk, so do so.

157
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,780
Seconds!

158
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,780
Oh please.

159
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,710
I don't have time to waste
over drunks, so excuse me.

160
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,100
Hey, what are you doing?

161
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,580
Well, I'm sorry, I don't want 
to drink with you either. But..

162
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,470
..I have to be drunk to say 
what I'm about to say.

163
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,510
Say what? What are you talking about?

164
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,190
It's about Yawara-san.

165
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,540
Yawara-san?

166
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,410
Yawara-san has been depressed ever since the news about your engagement.

167
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,970
She can't study or even do judo like that.

168
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,130
I see. So Yawara-san is that down...


169
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,210
But, I suppose it's hard to see the guy she loves get engaged to someone else.

170
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,190
Don't say it yourself, you transparent, lady-killer, perverted flirt!

171
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,070
I.. I'm the victim, too!

172
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,450
I never expected to be trapped into Sayaka-san's engagement!




173
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,190
Oh, is that so?

174
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,440
If that's so, then go see Yawara-san!

175
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,160
What?

176
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,820
Go see Yawara-san and bring her spirit up a bit.

177
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:57,170
I.. I'd like to do that, too, but Sayaka-san has been keeping me under her thumb these days.


178
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,440
I'm stuck with her all day tomorrow, too.

179
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,300
I'll take care of that end.


180
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,440
What?

181
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,440
I'll keep Miss Sayaka occupied.

182
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,770
Ma.. Matsuda-kun, you're 
such a nice guy, after all!

183
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,240
L.. let's drink up then! Have fun!

184
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,240
Okay? Okay?

185
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,640
They're wilting... the flowers I received
from Kazamatsuri-san.

186
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,110
Thanks for waiting, Yawara-san.

187
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,220
Yes.

188
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm probably looking for that single,
eternal woman to love.

189
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,160
Or something like that. Was that
a little pretentious?

190
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,800
Not really..

191
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,700
Our only daughter, Sayaka,
and Kazamaturi-kun...

192
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,360
..are now engaged!

193
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,750
Yawara, phone call. From somone 
called Kazamatsuri-san.

194
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,070
Kazamatsuri-san?

195
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,860
It's been a while, huh, Yawara-san?

196
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:42,690
I was actually nervous when I called
you last night, since I didn't know
if you'd see me ever again.

197
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,640
Umm, congratulations.

198
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,980
Sayaka-san is so pretty, 
and more mature than I am.

199
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,060
She's your perfect match, Kazamatsuri-san.

200
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,070
Oh gosh, that was harsh, Yawara-san.

201
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,390
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk about.

202
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,300
My engagement to Sayaka-san is a trap.

203
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,290
Trap?

204
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:10,580
Yes.

205
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,400
Just like a bird in cage, I was trapped.


206
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,460
I'm so excited to have you
introduce us to your fiance!

207
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,570
I'm so excited to have you
introduce us to your fiance!
I saw him in the newspaper once, 
but he looks so handsome!

208
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,180
I saw him in the newspaper once, 
but he looks so handsome!

209
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,770
Well, he is quite a catch!

210
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,260
My, so he's quite a catch!

211
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,460
I'm so envious of you, Sayaka-san!

212
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,000
Speaking of.. you're late, Kazamatsuri-san...

213
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,580
It's true that I'm going to work in 
the Hon'ami Group upon graduation.

214
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,420
And as I said, it has nothing to do
with my dealing with Sayaka-san.

215
00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:01,670
But, other people perceived it differently, and fabricated this situation, layer upon layer..

216
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,430
..and entrapped me live, like a helpless bunny.

217
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,410
Everything was a lie! 
A totally made-up scheme!

218
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,680
What is Kazamatsuri-san doing?

219
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,490
Yawara-san, you're the only 
person I don't want to fool.

220
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,030
Do you understand my dilemma, Yawara-san?


221
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,250
Kazamatsuri-san.

222
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,940
Oh gosh, I forgot! Sayaka-san's beeper!

223
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,600
Oh.. well, shall we go now?

224
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,880
What is this peculiar premonition that I feel?

225
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,800
Kazamatsuri isn't going to come.

226
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,260
You're that third-rate newspaper reporter.

227
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,730
Why are you here?

228
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,410
I bumped into Kazamatsuri, and he 
asked me to tell you that he had
an emergency and can't come.

229
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,500
Emergency?

230
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,090
What is this emergency?

231
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,420
A professor called him over, 
about his graduation thesis.

232
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,400
Thesis?

233
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,740
I see. I suppose it can't be helped.

234
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,650
The professor could be a woman. 
You know how he is, so...

235
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,150
Wha--?

236
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,070
Kazamatsuri-san can't do such a thing!

237
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,940
Oh, is that Sayaka-san's boyfriend?

238
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,180
He looks so different from the pictures.

239
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
N.. no, not this junky garbage.

240
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,710
J.. junky garbage?

241
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,910
Of course not!

242
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,900
A guy looking like some raw garbage...

243
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,570
..can't possibly be Sayaka-san's boyfriend!

244
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,260
..can't possibly be Sayaka-san's boyfriend!
R.. raw garbage?

245
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,370
R.. raw garbage?

246
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,310
Wh.. what?

247
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,720
He's coming this way!

248
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,240
Oh no.

249
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,280
What should we do?

250
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,390
M.. Mother! Father!

251
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,310
I'm Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke!

252
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,280
My specialty is food-shoveling!

253
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Oh gosh, what is he?

254
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,700
He's a psycho! A psycho!

255
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,970
Mother!

256
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,980
My gosh, how vulgar.

257
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,850
But, Kazamatsuri-san is so mean.

258
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,730
He should've told me that he'd be at school.

259
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,090
Today is Sunday.


260
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,340
Thanks for the meal.

261
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,350
Well, see you later.

262
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,940
Huh, I ate too much.

263
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,430
Yawara-san must be with 
that Kazamatsuri now...

264
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,980
Dammit, what am I doing?

265
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,440
Wait just a second.

266
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,260
I'm human, so I can't say that I don't lie.

267
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,070
But, I want to be honest and truthful with you.

268
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,660
Yawara-san, ever since I met you, your presence in my heart has gotten even larger.

269
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,350
Even larger as the days add on...

270
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,530
Kazamatsuri-san, how can 
you say that out in public?


271
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,850
I don't care who hears me.

272
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,790
Even if the whole world hears me.

273
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,310
Umm, excuse me.

274
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,850
You two have been selected as the Oshiuri TV Afternoon Wide Show's "Couple of the Day"!

275
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,440
Congratulations!


276
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,070
Look, you're on TV as we speak!

277
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,390
If Sayaka-san sees us like this..!

278
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,230
Come on, tell me what you're hiding from me.

279
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,690
You're mistaken. I'm not hiding anything.

280
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:03,950
Huh?

281
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,840
Oh, wait!

282
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,700
Well, wasn't that a cute couple?

283
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,400
Today's couple, at Harajuku's 
Pedestrian Haven.

284
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,430
To..

285
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,670
Tokunaga!

286
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,180
Yes!

287
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,860
Tokunaga! Tokunaga! Tokunaga!

288
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,040
It hurts, Kazamatsuri-san!

289
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

290
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,960
They caught me off guard.

291
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,560
Shall we have a seat somewhere?

292
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,170
What are you doing, Tokunaga?

293
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,590
Go faster!

294
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,920
B.. but, Miss, we're in Pedestrian Haven!

295
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,620
Anyway, do you believe me, Yawara-san?

296
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,140
Find Kazamatsuri-san and Inokuma DOROBO-NEKO Yawara, no matter what! 
[dorobo neko -- cat thief]

297
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,310
I won't let you!

298
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm hurting, Yawara-san. My heart bleeds 
when I think that you're still doubting me.

299
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,550
Kazamatsuri-san.

300
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,430
Please. Forgive me.

301
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,130
Forgive you... for?

302
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,830
I believe in you, Kazamatsuri-san.

303
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,740
Ya.. Yawara-san!

304
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,600
T.. To.. Tokunaga!

305
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,820
Yawara-san!

306
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,780
I cannot forgive you!

307
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,690
Miss..!

308
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,340
I cannot forgive you!

309
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,370
I cannot forgive you!
Please..! Please!

310
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,700
Please..! Please!

311
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,610
I cannot forgive you, DOROBO-NEKO Yawara! 
[dorobo-neko -- cat thief]

312
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:35,750
I cannot forgive you, DOROBO-NEKO Yawara! 
[dorobo-neko -- cat thief]
No violence..!

313
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,530
No violence..!

314
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,920
Well, Kazamatsuri-san..

315
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,340
It's tough, but good luck 
with your exam studies.

316
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,830
If you try hard enough,
anything will be possible.

317
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,210
Yes.

318
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,600
Well, goodnight.

319
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,030
Goodnight.

320
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,300
Kazamatsuri-san.

321
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,040
All right, study, study! Fight, Yawara!

322
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,010
What a big cat!

323
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,520
There you go.

324
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,530
Your smile fits you the best.

326
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,660
Yawara! How dare you come back 
so late again, you delinquent girl!

327
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,850
Thank you very much, Kazamatsuri-san.

328
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,240
Hurry up and make dinner, Yawara.

329
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,040
I'm so glad. Kazamatsuri-san was the 
kind of person I thought he was.

330
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,610
Hey, Yawara, you're a
yet-to-be married girl, so...

331
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:42,930
Hey, Yawara, you're a
yet-to-be married girl, so...
Oh, the phone's ringing?

332
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,960
Oh, the phone's ringing?

333
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,480
Yawara! Come here and sit down!

334
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,790
Next time, on Yawara! --
