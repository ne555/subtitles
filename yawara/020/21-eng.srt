1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,150
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,600
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,850
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,400
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,450
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,800
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,300
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,820
Yawara Inokuma, I came all the way
from Canada to see you.

10
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,960
Eh? No way!

11
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,730
Tanomou, Inokuma Yawara! 
[Tanomou -- I challenge you!]

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,750
Yawara and the Blue-eyed House Guest

13
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,740
Well, you know, umm...

14
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,770
Yawara-san versus Rockwell. 
The match of the century!

15
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,630
You'd better get some good shots, Kamoda!

16
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,180
M.. Matsuda-san, you're shaking my camera.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,300
To tell you the truth, I can't 
speak English that well.

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,020
I'm studying a lot of it for my college entrance exam, so when I'm better at it, then we could -

19
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,760
TANOMOU!
[TANOMOU! -- I challenge you!]

20
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,010
She's saying "tanomou", just like a dojo raider.

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,320
All she knows are these weird 
Japanese phrases.

22
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,690
Wh.. what's going on?

23
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,530
Ha.. Hanazono-san.

24
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,090
W.. we're in trouble!

25
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,790
Wha.. who is that?

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,170
She came out of nowhere to challenge Yawara-san to a match.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,760
What?

28
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,250
Tanomou, Yawara. 
[Tanomou -- I challenge you.]

29
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,930
Wh.. what's wrong, Hanazono-san?

30
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,590
Don't tell me that she's... Jody Rockwell!

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,700
Oh, so she's your friend?

32
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,800
No!

33
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,110
I saw her on TV.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,670
In last year's women's judo world championship, she won the 72kg 
and over class.. a champ!

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,630
She won the judo world championship?

36
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,210
It's dangerous, even for Yawara-san!

37
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,600
Tanomou, Yawara Inokuma! 
[Tanomou -- I'm asking you]

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,950
Please don't ask me anything.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,080
I don't want to fight you.

40
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,930
S.. stop it, you!

41
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,430
Okay, Inokuma, run away now.

42
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
B.. but...

43
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,070
Just leave it to Hanazono-san, and take off.

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,710
But..

45
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,830
I.. Inokuma. I, Hanazono, vow to sacrifice myself to keep her from laying a finger on you --

46
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,960
She's coming!

47
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,930
Yawara-san, hurry!

48
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,160
Yawara-san, hurry!
Yawara-san!

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,100
Yawara-san!

50
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,180
I, Hanazono, won't give up so easily --

51
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,260
With the three of us, we ought
to be able to stop her.

52
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,410
How could those guys get in the way!

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,740
I guess this dream match went down the drain.

54
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,940
Isn't she asking for her address?

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,550
No, we can't give her Yawara-san's address!

56
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,970
Screw you! We aren't gonna tell you --

57
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,010
Sure.

58
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,990
It's Tokyo, in the Setagaya-ku section...

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,830
Gosh, that scared me.

60
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,330
Who is she, anyway?

61
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,700
I wonder if the judo team is okay.

62
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,030
She seemed really strong..

63
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
Yawara!

64
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,050
I've got some good news!

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,490
Eh! You decided what?

66
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,450
I decided to officially enroll you
into the Saikai College.

67
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,770
Without even asking me first?

68
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,060
I wanted to see you happy face 
by surprising you.

69
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,920
That college holds up to its reputation.

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,120
You can definitely sharpen you skills there.

71
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,380
Why do you...

72
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,870
..always, always, always...

73
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,260
..decide things for me on your own!

74
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,180
Oh, are you that happy, Yawara?

75
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm angry!

76
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,800
Yeah, there was a thing called 'jungle gym' 
that you'll probably like.

77
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,020
It's an athletic gym!

78
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,880
I suppose.

79
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,010
Forget it. I'm never going
to go to Saikai College.

80
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,400
Where do you think you're going, 
you selfish child?

81
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,250
I'm going to take the exam for 
Mitsuba 2-year Women's College.

82
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,150
Mitsuba? Haven't heard of it.

83
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,230
Does it have a judo club?

84
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,260
No.

85
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,540
It doesn't have a judo club, nor even a dojo.

86
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,250
And, no sweaty guys, either.

87
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,680
What are you going to do at a place like that?

88
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,010
I'm going to enjoy my college life to the fullest.

89
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,100
Studying, wearing pretty clothes, 
and falling in love.

90
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,180
Stop blathering such silliness again!

91
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,620
It may be silly to you, but...

92
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,920
.. it's really important to me. I'm never 
going to go to Saikai College!

93
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,650
I ate a mountain-full of strawberry rice 
cakes that Coach Yuutenji gave me.

94
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,650
I can't refuse the offer after that.

95
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,180
Oh please. Big deal.

96
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,260
Don't trade me for some strawberry rice cakes.

97
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,790
Tanomou. 
[Tanomou -- Please.]

98
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,200
Who's this?

99
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,070
She chased me all the way from school.

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,190
She wants to fight me.

101
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,340
Tanomou. 
[Tanomou -- Please.]

102
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,140
Huh, she is a cut or two above anyone 
that Yawara's had to fight so far.

103
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,840
This sounds fun. I'd like to see her strength.

104
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,610
Yawara, do her a favor.

105
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,870
No way.

106
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,890
You're so spineless.

107
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,260
Tanomou! 
[Tanomou! -- Please!]

108
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,080
Very well. Go change into your dogi. 
[dogi -- judo uniform]

109
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,110
Grandpa.

110
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,060
Hurry, Kamoda!

111
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,100
Hurry, Kamoda!
Gotcha!

112
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,090
Gotcha!

113
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,430
We made it on time!

114
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,020
But, isn't something strange?

115
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,470
Oh yeah.

116
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,020
Why is the Gramps wearing a dogi?

117
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,130
Okay, give me your best shot.

118
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,950
Before you fight Yawara, I want to
see just how strong you are.

119
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,380
Wh.. what the...?

120
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,760
Stop it, Grandpa.

121
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,720
Come on!

122
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,940
Th.. this is..!

123
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,240
Grandpa!

124
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,490
Ma.. mairimashita! 
[Mairimashita! -- I give up!]

125
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,390
What a gramps! He made that Rockwell cry, without even fighting her.

126
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Oh gosh, he made her cry.

127
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,100
Okawari! 
[Okawari -- Seconds]

128
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,290
Grandpa, are you really going 
to take her in as a student?

129
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,020
This is her sixth bowl. Our food 
budget will bust at this rate.

130
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,610
She's got something if she was able to 
feel my strength in that confrontation.

131
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,330
She'll be a great workout partner for you.

132
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,890
B.. but...

133
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,310
Okawari! 
[Okawari! -- Seconds!]

134
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,270
J.. Jody!

135
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,280
Hurry up, Yawara!

136
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,840
J.. Jody, I was studying for the 
exam until 4am this morning.

137
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,870
I haven't slept much.

138
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,520
Oh, lack of sleep isn't good.

139
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,810
"Kids who sleep, grow."

140
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,140
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.

141
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,280
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.
Oh no. If I keep this up, I'll fail the exam.

142
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,940
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.

143
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,750
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.
If I fail to pass Mitsuba College's exam...

144
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,850
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.

145
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,800
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.
..I might be forced into Saikai College!

146
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,540
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.

147
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,060
56. 57. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. 66. 67.
Jody, how long are you staying here?

148
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,950
Jody, how long are you staying here?

149
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,420
Yes, for a while.

150
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,930
I became Jigoro-sensei's student.

151
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,770
Sensei is very strong.

152
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,710
But, you're strong too, Yawara.

153
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,570
Until I fight you, I'm not going back to Canada.

154
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,500
Belgium

155
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,880
Absolutely beautiful.

156
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,530
You've become even more glamorous
since I last saw you.

157
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,870
You shine as brilliantly as a diamond.

158
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,300
And you stand proud and 
elegant like a crimson rose.

159
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,540
None of the women here can stand a chance against your gleaming beauty.

160
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,350
I suppose it's true.


161
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,180
Your father has helped me out a lot.

162
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,570
Please enjoy your stay in Belgium
as much as possible.

163
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,100
Ambassador, I didn't come
to this country for fun.

164
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,340
I came here to fight Belgium's 
queen of judo, Belkens.

165
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,300
But I hear that she's out of town.

166
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,300
She probably knew that I was coming,
and ran away.

167
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,610
Belkens is a judo athlete and
also a famous fashion model...

168
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,070
...so she travels around the world quite often.

169
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,550
No, she must have ran away.

170
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,600
Right, Kazamatsuri-san?

171
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:39,400
But, Sayaka-san, even if Belkens
isn't here, there's still Stelkes.

172
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,930
Stelkes?

173
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,400
Look, that woman dancing over there.

174
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,030
She follows Belkens in strength and skill.

175
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,540
She might be a rather difficult
opponent for you, Sayaka-san.

176
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,100
S.. Sayaka-san.

177
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,370
Excuse me.

178
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,360
S.. Sayaka-san!

179
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,600
You're not much of a match for me!

180
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,790
Well, let's dance, Kazamatsuri-san.

181
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,850
Y.. yes.

182
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,190
My reputation...

183
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
I'm going to fail.

184
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,880
If I keep this up, I'm going
to fail my entrance exam.

185
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,760
Just as I thought.

186
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,320
She sure is a world class defender.

187
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,160
The two weeks since Jodei came, Yawara has been working very hard during practice.

188
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,760
I'm definitely going to fail.

189
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,930
Okay, how about "Oonin no Ran"?

190
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,890
Umm, 1467.

191
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,670
Post-meal workout, Yawara.

192
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,980
I'm going to fail.

193
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,510
Frequently.

194
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,970
"Shiba shiba"?

195
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,760
How about "hounding"?

196
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,120
Tanomou, Yawara!

197
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,420
Following, stalking.

198
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,370
Bus is no good.


199
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,110
Walking exercise to the house.

200
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,640
Survive, Yawara.

201
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,740
Yawara-san seems to have a handful.

202
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,740
Yeah.

203
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,810
"Desperate." Beyond hope.

204
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,780
Sorry, but I won't workout with her anymore.

205
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,170
I'm not going to open this no matter 
how much she calls for me!

206
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,810
Tanomou!

207
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,740
Yawara, tanomou!

208
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,840
Yawara, let's train some more.

209
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,430
Fail. I'm going to fail.

210
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,440
Fail...

211
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,100
Fail...

212
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,690
Inokuma-san.

213
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,310
Fail...

214
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,230
Inokuma-san.

215
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,020
Yawara. Yawara.

216
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,220
In deep sleep, Inokuma-san?

217
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,470
Yes. No, what page do I read from?

218
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:39,050
Don't bother. You're probably already 
set to enroll in Saikai College with 
a judo scholarship, right?

219
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,020
Which means, that my class is
meaningless to you, right?

220
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,150
No. That's not true.

221
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,690
Whatever. Read page 86 of 
the textbook, Nakagawa-kun.

222
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,210
Yes.

223
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,060
Let's fight. Tanomou, Yawara.

224
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,910
Jodei.

225
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,940
You want to fight Yawara that badly?

226
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,320
Wh.. what?

227
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,650
Cigarettes are a no-no. 
You won't grow if you do.

228
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,660
What the hell?

229
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,240
None of your business, stupid.

230
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,620
Why you!

231
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,150
Women's 
change room

232
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,730
Inokuma-kun!

233
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,020
There's trouble. A weird foreigner is out behind the gym, calling your name.

234
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,080
Y.. you did all this?

235
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,200
Yes. When I told them that cigarettes 
are bad, they wanted to fight me.

236
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,220
S.. someone, bring the stretchers.

237
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,230
I can't believe this.

238
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,390
Don't worry, I didn't use all my force.

239
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,250
Go home.

240
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,500
Go back to Canada.

241
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,560
I don't want to fight you. I don't want to do judo.

242
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,710
I'm studying for the entrance exams right now, so don't cause any trouble!

243
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,420
Don't wake me up so early!

244
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,450
Why'd you chase her away?



245
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,410
I'm asking you why you chased a girl that 
came all the way from Canada away?

246
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,050
She was a nice person, huh, even though 
she ate 5 helpings worth of rice.

247
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,300
Okawari. 
[Okawari -- Seconds]

248
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,930
The dining room seems so 
empty all of a sudden.

249
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,350
That's not the point.

250
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,740
She studied Japanese really hard, 
so that she could fight you.

251
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,970
She must've thought that you'd fight her
if she was able to say it right.

252
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,000
Ohayou. 
[Ohayou -- Good morning]

253
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,490
Ohayou.

254
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,900
Konnichiwa. 
[Konnichiwa -- Good afternoon]

255
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,640
She was studying Japanese 
every night until daybreak.

256
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,050
She was studying Japanese 
every night until daybreak.
Konnichiwa.

257
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,360
She was studying Japanese 
every night until daybreak.

258
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,600
S.. so she didn't sleep, studied all night, and went to early morning practices like me?

259
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,470
And yet, she was able to speak Japanese 
so well in such a short time?

260
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,480
I studied English really hard, too, 
but I can't speak it that well.

261
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,650
Her strong desire to have a match with 
you gave her the edge over you.


262
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,340
Your petty desire to study for the entrance
exam is nothing compared to her desire.

263
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
Jody!

264
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,840
I forgot something.

265
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,310
Jody!

266
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,390
What's wrong, Yawara?

267
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,890
I'm so sorry, Jody.

268
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,610
I said such mean things to you.

269
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,660
I'm so sorry.

270
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,210
Let's do a match, Jody!

271
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,420
Jody!

272
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,780
She took the bait.

273
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,030
Bow!

274
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:23,980
859 Days to the Barcelona Olympics

275
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,020
Finally the match, Yawara! 
Against a world class athlete!


276
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,300
It seems like things out turning out
just like you planned, Grandpa.

277
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,600
If you beat Jodei, there's no doubt 
that you're the world's best.

278
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,540
Actually, I don't have the time to do this.

279
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,450
I'm falling behind in my studies, too.

280
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:42,610
I'm falling behind in my studies, too.
Don't just stand there, Yawara. We're about
to start. Hurry up and go change.

281
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,900
Don't just stand there, Yawara. We're about
to start. Hurry up and go change.
