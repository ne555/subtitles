00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,890
Ippon! 
[Ippon -- Victory!]

10
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,830
How disturbing!

11
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,850
Jody Rockwell has been defeated!

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,870
Soviet's Anna Teleshikova beat the world-champ defender, Jody Rockwell, with 
a splendid oo-soto gari ippon victory!
[oo-soto gari -- large outer reap]

13
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,540
Don't tell me she calculated 
every move for this win!

14
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,230
What a sight.

15
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,670
Rockwell is totally immobile.

16
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,150
She's being taken away in a stretcher.

17
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:09,450
A Shocking Invitation For Yawara!

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,570
It'll take her 6 months to recover.

19
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,700
But even if she's healed, how long will it 
take until she can do judo again...?

20
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,640
After all, her ligament behind 
her left knee was torn off.

21
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,380
I guess your plan of fighting 
Jody in a tournament will be
on the back burner for a while.

22
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,140
So what are you going to do, Yawara-san?

23
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,630
You still have 3 tournaments left.

24
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,690
I see.

25
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,520
But don't tell me you've given up judo.

26
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,440
But Jody won't be...

27
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,990
Don't worry. She'll come back for sure!


28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,680
Did you forget, Yawara-san? How excited 
you were when you fought her?

29
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,680
And that you wanted to fight Jody again?

30
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,580
That's why you need to keep doing judo.

31
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,330
Right?

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,780
I need to go back to my exam studies.

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,610
Excuse me.

34
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,470
Teleshikova's post-match interview, 
describing the details of the match.

35
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,300
Teleshikova..

36
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,480
It has nothing to do with me.

37
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,690
Yawara-san!

38
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,080
W.. wait!

39
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,770
Please read it.

40
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,160
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,110
Teleshikova-san, your feelings on 
defeating the tough Rockwell?

42
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,520
I had enough data on Rockwell.

43
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,620
With a strategy utilizing this data, 
there was no doubt that I would win.

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,930
You're quite confident.

45
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,440
Now that you've defeated Rockwell, is there anyone that would be a threat to you?

46
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,850
Well..

47
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,410
There is one person that 
I have been thinking about.

48
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,520
It's hard to tell her strength, without 
having enough data on her.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
Yawara Inokuma.

50
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,050
I want to fight Japan's Yawara Inokuma.

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,200
Unless I defeat her, I don't feel 
that I'm the world's best.


52
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,900
Come on, Yawara!

53
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,090
Ippon!

54
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,880
Hon'ami Sayaka has made it to the finals!

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,180
She's become stronger!

56
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,230
Hon'ami Sayaka has become two
to three times more powerful!

57
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,440
She's made a great comeback since 
her defeat to Inokuma Yawara!

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,820
Ippon!

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,700
Hon'ami-san, a comment please!

60
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,760
What do you think about Inokuma's 
withdrawal from this tournament?

61
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,580
Err, that's..!

62
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,530
Yawara-san, are you watching?

63
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,960
You are no longer my rival or anything!

64
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,490
Are you so scared of losing to me? Chicken!

65
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,280
Yawara!

66
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,820
What is she doing, that stupid child!

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,500
Yawara-san didn't come, after all.

68
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,450
Yawara-san.

69
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,590
Yawara!

70
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,210
Where are you, Yawara!?

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
Come out, Yawara!

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,390
How dare you ditch the tournament!

73
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,420
Did you forget about your promise to Jodei?

74
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,390
You can't fool me when you said that your 
back hurts or you have a headache!

75
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,160
You were all fine and dandy this morning!

76
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,740
Open.. up! Yawara!

77
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,290
Father, you're so lively, as usual.

78
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:26,530
I brought your favorites, Mutsuwan scallops and the famous Osore-zan sake.

79
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,340
Ta.. Tamao-san.

80
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,360
Oh! Mom!

81
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,190
I'm back.

82
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,960
Oh.. my.

83
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,440
Ya.. Yawara, you..!

84
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,950
Sayaka-san, what's wrong?

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,400
Including today's match, 
you've been irritated lately.

86
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,820
I am not.. irritated!

87
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,230
It's Yawara-san's fault, isn't it?

88
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,940
Kazamatsuri-san, do you know 
what next next Monday is?

89
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:10,950
Eh?

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,990
It's Miss Sayaka's birthday.

91
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,850
O.. oh yes, it's your birthday, right? 
Umm, you'll be 19 years --

92
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:22,890
O.. oh yes, it's your birthday, right? 
Umm, you'll be 19 years --
I will be 18!

93
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,210
I will be 18!

94
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,850
How can I face my birthday..

95
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,010
..while I'm still lost to Inokuma Yawara.. 
for my 18th birthday!

96
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,010
While I'm still lost to her!

97
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,660
I can't have a "Happy" Birthday like that!

98
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,760
Sa.. Sayaka-san..!

99
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,200
Yawara..


100
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,830
So, this Jody-san came 
all the way from Canada?

101
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,860
But how is she doing with that injury?

102
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,190
Even if she recovers, it's hard to tell
if she can ever do judo again or not.

103
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,640
I feel so sorry for Jody.

104
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,490
But that's too bad, since Jody-san 
made you so excited about judo.

105
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,140
Not anymore.

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,060
I hate judo, since it causes 
people to have serious injuries.

107
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,680
But because you were in that tournament,
Dad supposedly came back.

108
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:38,940
What?

109
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,780
I heard that a person who looked like Dad was in Aomori's Osore-zan area, so I went there.



110
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,890
According to Itako-san, that man said...

111
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,640
"I need to go to Tokyo's Martial Arts Hall. Thank you for everything."

112
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,070
After saying that, he disappeared.

113
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,160
When did that happen?


114
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,640
It was 2 days before your tournament
in the Martial Arts Hall.

115
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,930
Dad came to watch my tournament?

116
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,650
Yes.

117
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,390
That runaway son, Kojiro...

118
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,840
Tamao-san, can I have another drink?

119
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,560
Oh sure. Coming.

120
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,000
This is Sayaka. Good morning!

121
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,840
Kazamatsuri-san, do you 
remember today's schedule?

122
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,200
Breakfast at Sayaka's at 7am, 
judo practice with Sayaka at 8am.

123
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,830
Shopping for clothes with Sayaka at 10am.

124
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,940
Dance lessons with Sayaka at 11am.

125
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,360
Lunch at a French restaurant
with Sayaka at 12pm.

126
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,790
A drive with Sayaka at 1pm.

127
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,350
Well then, I'll see you.

128
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,100
No, no... NO!

129
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,690
If I keep this up, I won't have 
time to date other girls!

130
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,560
Especially with Yawara-san, 
since that last meeting.

131
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,450
I wonder if I removed all doubts from her then.

132
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,190
And, she did withdraw from the 
tournament the other day, maybe...

133
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,320
Umm..

134
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,430
This is the Inokuma residence.

135
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,450
This is Inokuma. Who is this?

136
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,890
Umm, err...

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,990
U.. umm, I'm a fan of Inokuma 
Jigoro-sensei, but..

138
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,230
Oh really!?

139
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,130
Y.. yes!

140
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,830
Is that so?

141
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,130
So what do you want? An autograph?

142
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,910
Y.. yes, please.

143
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,370
Oh.. no, I can't possibly visit you at your house!

144
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,770
Well, thank you, nonetheless.

145
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,920
Th.. that was nerve wrecking.

146
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,340
Oh.. yeah!

147
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,970
Yawara, time for practice!

148
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,910
Come to the dojo, now!

149
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,330
Grandpa.

150
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,990
I have to study for exams.

151
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,360
Don't give me that!

152
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,520
You don't need to study for anything!

153
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,700
You know what college you're going to!

154
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm not going to Saikai College.

155
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,750
Oh, weren't you saying that there was a senior's meeting at Zen-san's?

156
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,240
Senior's meeting?

157
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,480
Oh gosh, I completely forgot! This is bad!

158
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,170
No!

159
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,070
Yawara, you better do 1000 uchi-komis 
before I get back!
[uchi-komi -- repeated throw practice]

160
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,360
Geez, Grandpa.

161
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,160
For me?

162
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,920
The sender has paid for everything.

163
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,680
Thank you very much.

164
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
From Kazamatsuri

165
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,770
Kazamatsuri-san.

166
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,740
It's very sudden, but I just 
had to send you flowers.

167
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,760
I was very worried about removing
any doubts the other day...

168
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,820
...since we had so little time to discuss matters.

169
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,270
But, I'm hoping that you 
understand my feelings.

170
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,440
Good luck on your exam studies.

171
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,900
Sincerely, Kazamatsuri.

172
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,180
Kazamatsuri-san.

173
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,700
Closed for the day

174
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,600
Maru-zen Electronics Shop

175
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,230
You're late, Jigoro-san.

176
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,680
That's.. so.. very..

177
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,370
I'm home.

178
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,580
Oh. Yawara, there's a letter for you!

179
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,900
P.S. It's a casual party, so please come wearing comfortable clothing. Sayaka

180
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,980
And, I received this, so... yes.

181
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,520
What? An invitation for you?

182
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,530
Oh, really?


183
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm going to be at that party, 
so you should come also.

184
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,460
But, is it really alright for me to 
attend Sayaka-san's party?

185
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,610
What are you saying?

186
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,390
Outside of matches, you and Sayaka-san 
are good friends, right?

187
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,460
I see. Yes.

188
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,940
Then I'll see you at the party.

189
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,640
A.. and, thank you for the flowers.

190
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,410
I believe in you, Kazamatsuri-san.

191
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,740
Goodbye.

192
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,960
Kazamatsuri-san.

193
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,680
She's so cute.

194
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,110
But, Yawara-san was invited?

195
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,180
What is Sayaka-san thinking?

196
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,670
Is this okay?

197
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,960
Oh yes. It's fabulous!

198
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,540
But it's Sayaka-san's party, so maybe everyone's all dressed up...

199
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,230
Don't worry.

200
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,020
She said that it's fine to come 
in comfortable clothes, right?

201
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,950
Yeah.

202
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,620
Well, I'm going.

203
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,540
Don't get careless.

204
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,470
I won't.

205
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,540
Well then.

206
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,050
Oh.

207
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,420
Father, where are you going?

208
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,470
To a party, jya!

209
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,420
Welcome to the party. 
Everyone is waiting for you.

210
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,320
Thank you very much for inviting me.

211
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,090
Please enter.

212
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,980
Oh gosh! Everyone's so dressed up!

213
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,150
Umm, I'm going...

214
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,800
Umm, I'm going...
Yawara-san!

215
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,110
Yawara-san!

216
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,010
I've been waiting for you.

217
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,780
Kazamatsuri-san!

218
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:34,250
What is that Miss Sayaka thinking, inviting
the media for her dumb birthday party?

219
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,470
Kamoda, get some manners!

220
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,630
Hey, over there.

221
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
Ya.. Yawara-san!

222
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,790
Welcome, Yawara-san.

223
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,940
Sayaka-san.

224
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,460
Please enjoy your stay at this party.

225
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,500
P.S. It's a casual party, so please come wearing comfortable clothing. Sayaka

226
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,820
I've been had!

227
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,800
Gotcha.


228
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,820
Escorting her? How nice of you.

229
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,360
Well, since Yawara-san looked 
so wonderful, I just had to...

230
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,030
Very true. She's in such comfortable clothing.

231
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,740
Isn't she?

232
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,630
Oh yes! Inokuma-sensei came here before you.

233
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,570
What?

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,300
Oh, Yawara, you're late.

235
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,830
You'd better hurry, or all the 
good food will be gone.

236
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,130
This is the worst.

237
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,620
Yawara-san. Hi!

238
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,190
Matsuda-san.

239
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,140
Sayaka-san, wasn't the newspaper coverage supposed to be done by the Big 3 papers?

240
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,620
Sorry for being a third-rate newspaper!

241
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,610
Oh, Matsuda-san, that necktie 
looks great on you.

242
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,140
"Even the packhorse driver looks
fine in proper dress," right?

243
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,770
No, I thought you were celebrating shichi-go-san. 
[Shichi-go-san -- Children's holiday celebrating 3rd, 5th, and 7th birthdays.]

244
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,140
No, I thought you were celebrating shichi-go-san. 
[Shichi-go-san -- Children's holiday celebrating 3rd, 5th, and 7th birthdays.]
I invited them. Since today is such a special day.

245
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,220
I invited them. Since today is such a special day.

246
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,160
What are you up to, Hon'ami Sayaka?

247
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Thank you for attending my birthday party.


248
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,930
Without every one of you, I could not
have celebrated my birthday.

249
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,010
Please enjoy your stay.

250
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,050
To start off, we'll have Sayaka-sama blow 
out the candles on her birthday cake.

251
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,390
That's Miss Sayaka for you. 
Everything's so flashy.

252
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,060
Now we'll have Sayaka-sama's father 
and also Hon'ami Group's CEO...

253
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,380
...Hon'ami Kinnosuke give a few comments.


254
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:43,190
Thank you very much for attending the birthday party of my only daughter, Sayaka, today.

255
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,650
Thank you very much for attending the birthday party of my only daughter, Sayaka, today.
Yawara, this snail is delicious!


256
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,520
We have great news, also.

257
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,080
Kazamatsuri-kun, please come here.

258
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,830
Kazamatsuri-san?

259
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,920
As everyone knows, Kazamatsuri-kun
is Sayaka's judo coach.

260
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:13,520
When he graduates from college next spring, he will work for the Hon'ami group.


261
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,830
And, he is the only son of the well-established Kazamatsuri Brewery...

262
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,330
...which has decided to merge 
with the Hon'ami Group.

263
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,230
Kazamatsuri-kun's father 
and mother are very elated.

264
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,280
Kazamatsuri-kun's father 
and mother are very elated.
These black fish eggs are also delicious.

265
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,130
Kazamatsuri-kun's father 
and mother are very elated.

266
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,030
And, we have a much bigger and happier news!

267
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,310
Our only daughter, Sayaka, 
and Kazamaturi-kun...

268
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,110
..are now engaged!

269
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,640
What?

270
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,750
W.. wait.

271
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,300
This is a very happy outcome!

272
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,560
This is a very happy outcome!
F.. Father.. what's this about?

273
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,700
F.. Father.. what's this about?

274
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,830
Shinnosuke, now our Kazamatsuri 
Brewery is in safe hands.

275
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,700
N.. no way.

276
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,600
So that means...

277
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,720
Wait, everyone --

278
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,310
This is Sayaka.

279
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,720
To be engaged to Kazamatsuri-san 
is the happiest event for me.

280
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,850
But, in order to have a blissful marriage,
I must do one thing.

281
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,270
That is, to defeat Inokuma Yawara, 
and become Number One in Japan!

282
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,620
What a persistent Miss!

283
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,680
Right, Yawara?

284
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,840
Kazamatsuri-san is engaged to Sayaka-san..

285
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,350
..engaged!

286
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,880
Wh.. what's wrong, Yawara?

287
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,160
Here, have a lobster. Lobster!

288
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,360
She's totally out of it.

289
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,330
Well then, I'll take on the challenge for her!


290
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,590
Sorry to crash your party, but you'll never beat Yawara in a hundred or two hundred years!

291
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,010
I'll give that right back to you.


292
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,900
And to Yawara-san, who is running 
away with her tail between her legs.

293
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,720
What? Yawara?

294
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,220
Yawara!

295
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,400
Yawara-san!

296
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,610
Yawara-san!

297
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:42,080
I.. I was the only one thinking 
we had something.

298
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,270
Kazamatsuri-san...

299
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,190
I'm.. such a fool!

300
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,270
After all this, even Inokuma Yawara
would come back to fight me.

301
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,010
Let's settle this once and for all.. 
Inokuma Yawara-san!

302
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:23,350
803 Days to the Barcelona Olympics


303
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,360
The food was good, and it 
was an enticing party!

304
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,070
You don't even know how I feel, Grandpa!

305
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,120
What about your feelings?

306
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,640
Now you can forget about that KazaMIDORI and devote yourself to judo, Yawara!

307
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,420
Kazamatsuri-san isn't that kind of person!

308
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,630
Next time, on Yawara! --

309
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,030
"Yawara and the Love Square"

310
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,950
I'll do an utsuri-goshi on 
those who don't watch!
