1
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,107
Absolutely the worst.

2
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,866
Another nameko misc soup, please.

3
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,325
Yes.

4
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:57,450


5
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,078
Tammaan's cookilng is always the best.

6
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,245


7
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,539
She's the mirror of Japanese making.

8
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:02,664


9
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,166
Of couwrse, Yawara's cooking is great, also.

10
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,459
You have great potential.

11
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,672
Grandfather, you seem so cheerful this morning.

12
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,340
He probably has a fever or something.

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,634
No, I'm absoluteiy healthy.

14
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,511
Another large bowl of kinpira gobou, please.

15
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:16,594


16
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,345
Yes.

17
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,264


18
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,977
Chairman Tamaranch finally
set up an open-weight class.



19
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,231
My ippon zeoi probably convinced him

20
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:35,447


21
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,489
Freaky.

22
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:36,740


23
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,867
You realily are cheerfu.l..


24
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,661
What is with this messed up article-l

25
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,078


26
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,872
Open-weight class?!

27
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,039


28
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,957
Stop spreading lies!

29
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:53,006
S,. Sir, it's based on factsm
r., right. Matsuda-kun?

30
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,548
Yes!

31
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,007


32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,886
Ma... Matsuda, you wrote this garbage?

33
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,096
You're talking about the International
Olympic Committee!

34
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,182
Gossip bits aren't going to cut it!

35
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,977
I'm confident about this article,
but it's a long smry.

36
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,105
I don't have time to hear it all!

37
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:09,272


38
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,733
You're coming with me to the official press
conference of the chosen
Japanese Judo Athelentes.

39
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:11,858


40
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,068
Outstanding, let's go!

41
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,198
Listen! If your story is false,
you're tired. Fired. Fired!

42
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,453
Awesome! I've airways put my career
on the line for lnokuma Yawara!

43
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,747
You cocky bastard! Come here!

44
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,250


45
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,127
Matsuda is at it again.

46
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,130
No one stakes their careers on
swaps any-mare, you know.

47
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,965
Kousaku, you're the man!

48
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,009


49
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,552
Did you read Daily Every?

50
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,096
The openvweight class?

51
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,639
Gossip crap again.

52
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,726
Since their sales are low, they have to rely on
gossip to keep up with the larger papers.

53
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:46,935


54
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,853
That's why they dnn't sell well.

55
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,605
What a vicious cycle.

56
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,439


57
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,401
You're fired. You get it, Matsuda? Youu're fired!

58
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,945
Don't worry. We'll beat the others, for sure.

00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,291
Let me explain.

110
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,379
Before he left, Chairman Tamaranch held
a last-minute meeting and decided

111
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,675
to create an open-weight class at the World Culp.

112
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,759
You did it, Matsuda-kun..

113
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,969
I believed in you from the beginning.

114
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,721
lnokuma-san, please comment.

115
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,098
Do you think you'll win?

116
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:48,390


117
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,267

00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,519


119
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,021
She'll win all the matches with an ippon....

120
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,271


121
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,192

Hey, did you see?

131
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,341


132
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:28,805
Oh yeah, a bunch of photographers
at the main gate.

133
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,264


134
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,183
I think they took a picture of
me. I don't know what to do.

135
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,184
Whatever.

136
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:33,309


137
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,688
But, is there a girl that popular at this school?

138
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,230
Hmm. . .

139
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,647
There is.
Hmm. . .

140
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,398
There is.

141
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,150
What? You?

142
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,275


143
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,568
Not me.

144
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,361
Who do you think she is?

145
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,780
What? IInokuma-san?

146
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,823


147
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,198
Yes.

148
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:47,574


149
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,869
She doegn't belong in this cooking chess.

150
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,872
She's the mining star of the World Cup.

151
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,707
World Cup? What's that?

152
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,670
hnokuma-san, you shouldn't
be wasting your time here.

153
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,174
The World Cup is coming up. Shouldn't
you be training for that?

154
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:04,549


155
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,052
Fujiko-san, I refused to go.

156
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,428


157
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:13,266
Wha-t? Refused? Why?

158
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,978
I told you before... that my jludo is violent.

159
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,690

173
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,489


174
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,617
You shouvldn't waste your energy on that.

175
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,077


176
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,744

Let's go together, to the training camp.

What, a training camp?

183
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:25,463

187
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,767
So, I was hopilng that you would
come coach them...

188
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,645
I don't mach wimps.

189
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,313
Ilnokwmawsensei.

190
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,775
Is the training camp food any good?

191
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:51,906
Yes! I have a Teikoku Prince hotel
chaf as your personal cnok.

192
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,159


193
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,663
Yumenj-i-san, l"ll accept your offer
because of your huge face.

194
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,251
Thank you very much.

195
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:10,717
What about Yawara-san? Is she reawllly
not going to the World Cup?

196
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,220
I'm not going to allow that.

197
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,222
You were, Kazamatsuri-san?

198
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,435
Yes. I was chosen to be the female team coach.

199
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,023
Now I can Finally be your coach.

200
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,905
We've been an opposfte SJdES for too long,

201
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,746
Let's go to the World Cup togerhenr.

202
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,750
Actualllly, I want to gn with you, Yawarawsann.

203
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:57,138
Sayaka-san's selfish tantrums helped
out this time, since I was forced to
become the female team coach.

204
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:57,347


205
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,140
I can be this close to Yawara-san!

206
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,644


207
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:08,316
You mentioned before... that l was shining
most brilliantly when I did judo.

208
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,359


209
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,611
So if I dont do jludo, am I not attractive a-nymnre?

210
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:11,695


211
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,196
N.. No, of course not.

212
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:13,405


213
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,282
Ya-wara-san, you're very attractive
regardless of judo!

214
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:16,658


215
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,951
But. . .

216
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,829
I want to do many things beiides judo.

217
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,413


218
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,500
Cooking... and knitting... W I do that
i-nstaad, am I nut MUBCLi'Ve?

219
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,792


220
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,835
You nill are!

221
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:26,960


222
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,505
I would love to eat your home-cooked meals!

223
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,464


224
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,091
What are you saying, Shinnosuke?!

225
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:33,216


226
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,428
I'M try my best to make qing jiao rou-si.

227
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:36,511


228
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,640
Qilng jiauo rowsi? I love it! It's my favorite dish!

229
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,890


230
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,059
llt's tasty and nutritious...

231
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,060
Not that!

232
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,937
And beef stroganoff.

233
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,522
Beef strog'anom

234
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:53,069
It's difficult to make the demuigiace
sauce, since yau need to si-mmr
it for a bong time while is stidky!

235
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,194


236
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,404
Yes, exactly!

237
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,697
No, it's not!

238
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,281


239
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,117
Weclll Yawara-sam, you'll make a great bride.

240
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,289
l see, so she's not home yet.

241
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,540
Okay then.

242
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,881
Right when the open-weight was
finalily cre ated. . . Yawara-san.

243
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,844


244
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,222
In preparation for the upcoming Judo
World Cup, Russia's Te-leshfkova,

245
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,518
Belgium's Bellkens, and many other
worLd athletes have arrived.

246
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,311


247
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,606
ls llnokuma Yawara really not
going to the World Cup?

248
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,608
We'll have to wait and see.

249
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,901
Innokulmawsan

250
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,328
Everyone is so dressy.

251
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,287
True.

252
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:44,579


253
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,997
Everyone seems to be having fun.

254
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:46,164


255
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:46,956
True.

256
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,170
But, are they truly having fun?

257
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,129
HIuh ?

258
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,759
Dressing up, going out, falling
in love.  sure it's fun.

259
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,430
Bu-t aren't they a." thinking
that samething's missing?

260
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,348


261
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,185
Aren't they looking for something
that motivates them from within?

262
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,561
Fujiikn-san.

263
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,191
You have that! You have j-u-do!

264
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:17,237


265
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,239
It's over.

266
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,826
No, its not. Absobutel'y not!

267
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,707
Innokwmawsan.

268
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,379
My Mood-stained toe shoasm

269
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:35,672
Mood?

270
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:42,929
If my feet got targer than those shoes,
I couldln't continue doing ballet.

271
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,141
That's why I kept wearing them...

272
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,435
..even when my toenaifs aptitm

273
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,271
..and blood spulrted out...

274
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,941
..and the tips turned red from the blood...

275
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,070
..I stil-l kept dancing.

276
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,373
Thafs because you liked ballet, Fujika-san.

277
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,710
I didn't choose tn do jurdn.


278
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,755
Before I knew i.t., I was already doing judo.

279
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:21,051
Ever since I was little. I diudnlt have a choice.

280
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,386
By the time I realized what was
going on, I had become strong.

281
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,556
It's different from your situation, Fujikn-san.

282
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,393
Yes, we're very different, Inukumna-sa.n..

283
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,066
You were chosen to succeed!

284
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,534
I wasn't... chosen...

285
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,287
No...

286
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,086
I really wanted to dance for the world.

287
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,132
But you can!

288
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:07,722
You can make my unfulfilled dream a reality!

289
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:07,931
You can make my unfulfilled dream a reality!

290
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,225
Fuj'iiko-san .

291
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,282
But you can!

292
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,702
You can make my unfulfilled dream a reality!

293
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,756
Are you really not going to the Warld Quip?

294
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,049


295
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,386
If you really unsist, then that's that,

296
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,178


297
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,305
But let me just say this.

298
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:49,806


299
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,184
Jody, Telesm'ko'va, and Balkans
a.l.l want to fight you.

300
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:53,893


301
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,814
It's because you have that much
talent and brilliance.

302
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,815


303
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,275
Not anyone can do that.

304
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:00,859


305
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,611
Only the chosen times can shine.

306
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,533
You were chosen. Yawara-san,
you're everyone's dream.

307
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,995
You said the same thing as Fujikmsan.

308
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,413
H-uh ?

309
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,415


310
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:20,211
Matsuda-san, I learned how to make
quing jiao rou-si yesterday.

311
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,379


312
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,213
Qviln jiao. .?

313
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,426
Next weak, I'm making coup
de peisan. Can't wait.

314
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,471
Geez, what are you sayilng?

315
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,348
We're not ta-lki'ng about cooking right ncw.

316
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,273
But, I need to learn how to
make that dish on my own.

317
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,568
Because I'm going to miss ctasses next week.

318
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944
What?

319
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:50,075
Matauvda-san, I think I"Ll go to the World Cuwp.

320
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,495
Hmph, Yawara.

321
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:53,870


322
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,957
WI make you go to the training camp
and straighten your ways.

323
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,170
What a skimpy little thing.

324
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,545


325
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,589
Haw cam you hn'de your but: with this?

326
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,176
Grandpa, why are you in my room again?

327
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:08,802
Ahh !

328
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,929
Gosh, don't do stupid thilngx!

329
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,350
I wasn't doing anything stupid. I was
packing stuff for your training camp.

330
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,143
I can do that myself.

331
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,731
You're going to the training camp?

332
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,400
Yea.

333
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,025


334
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,569
Which means, you're going to the World Cup?

335
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,363
Yes.

336
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,739
Really?

337
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,450
So youTe ready for all this! I thought so.

338
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:38,873
No matter how you cut it, the blood of a judo
athlete is pummng thmugh
your body like hot lava!

339
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,168
Good news, Yawara. I heard that ths
trailniing camp food is denlricious!

340
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,261
Next !

341
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,763
Whoa, what speed!

342
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,099
Hey Kausaku, let's go already.

343
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,560
We'U be in deep trouble if we get caught.

344
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:03,440
What sharp execution. No wonder
Jody Rockwell lost easily.

345
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,193
Oh gosh, Yawara-san, you're
going up against a monster.

346
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:07,944


347
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,612
Come on, Kousaku.

348
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,287
I though: you were suspicious,
you newspaper reporter;

349
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,664
They could be spies for the Japanese team.

350
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,081


351
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,042
What did they say? Do you know Russian?

352
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,879
Of course not. That's why
I wanted us to leave fast.

353
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:26,629
Excuse me.

354
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,800


355
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,801
Telueshilkova.

356
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,555
Do you know Yawacra I-nok'uma?

357
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:36,431
What?

358
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,433
She knows Japanese?

359
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:43,229
Yawarawsan and I are mam than jun friends.

360
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,731
Oh, what does that mean?

361
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,358
Please telll her.

362
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,361
I"m going to win the Worm Cup.

363
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,403


364
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,989
I watched the video, marry times.

365
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:53,531


366
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,284
I researched and trained, for wear a year.

367
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:56,910


368
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,372
Judo became much more fun
because of Yawara hnok'uma.

369
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,374
That's great.

370
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,541
Kausaku !

371
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,669
But infll bye mare fun!

372
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,964
Once you fight her in person, it'll be more fun!

373
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,178
And when you lose to Yawara-san.
i-t'll be even more fun!

374
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,639
You'll discover the deeper meaning of judo than!

375
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,016


376
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,267
We're sorry.

377
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:21,518


378
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,771
Come on Kausaku, apologize. Kousaku!

379
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,609
How stuffy! How smelily!

380
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:29,859


381
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,864
I didn't know the training camp was
caved with big, sweaty guys!

382
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,281


383
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,117
Don't say that, Sayaka-san.

384
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,622
If I had known, we COUIle have trained
alone at my private mansion.

385
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,001
Oh yes, het's go now.

our sweet Little training!

387
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,882
Oh, Yawara-san, when are you

388
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:56,136
Uh Imiwma-sensei, when 'IB Yawawra-san coming?

389
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,222
Don't sweat it, you timid fool.

390
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,891
Come on, Kazamatswri-san, lets go.

391
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:02,600

You have such a lovely hairstyle.
And you're grim.

398
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,993
You must be a strong judo athlete, huh?

399
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,161
Whoa !

400
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:27,542


401
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:32,630
That Kaza-m'idori, only if he didn't get
nervous in public, he'd be able to take
on the Wld also. What a waste.

402
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,881


403
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,467
