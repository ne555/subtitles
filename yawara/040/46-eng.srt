A guest?

219
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,070
Yawa-ra!

220
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,989
Jody!

221
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,204
I came here, since I heard the
team from Japan just arrived.

222
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,498
Why are you dressed like that?

223
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,540


224
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,543
Yawara, I can't wait until the event.

225
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,003
Let's have a match right here, right now.

226
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,464
Noway...

227
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,718
It's a joke!

228
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,345
I'm just kidding!

229
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,473
I stopped by, since I was near by for my training

230
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,101

231
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,773
I can finally fight with you.

232
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,483
It's like a dream.

233
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,988
Yawara, that joke was half serious,

234
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,992
Bevkenrs of Belgium and the girl
who beat me, Teleshikova,

235
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,746
they alll came to Seoul to fight with you.

00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,122


237
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,248
No way...

238
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,416
It's true!

239
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,252
I knaw how eweryone feels.

240
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,713
Whoever can win against you
will be the jundzo Che mpiion.

241
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,090


242
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,593
Oh yaah, we are abauut to go out for sight seeing.

243
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,303
Do you want to come along?

244
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,432
No, I'm gming back to my training

245
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:45,974

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,228


249
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,359
I won't shake your hand anymore.

250
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,862
We'll shake hands after the match.

251
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,197
Save the handshake until then.

252
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,450

00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,368

00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:10,248
This is Ewha Women's Uni'versjty Street,
the place for the latest fasm'non in Seoul"

256
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,667

00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,168


258
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,337

date with just you and ma

262
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:22,469


263
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,054
Don't spoill the fun.

264
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,223
We came here together before too.

265
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,643
I want to be alone with Yawara-san too!

266
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,061

I see.

275
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,746
Your earnestness is part of your strength.

276
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,538


277
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,831

286
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,723


287
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,684

312
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,674


313

me the greatness of judo.

315
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,603
And I'm the one who taught her judo.

00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,331


324
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:01,461

00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,295


326
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,296

327
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:08,802
If he can be found so easily, she
would have found him long ago.
