120
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:51,249


121
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,543

123
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:04,763
Ever since she started Mii-- haa College, We
trained her every day even harder.

124
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:05,930
And then!

125
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,557


126
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,267

127
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:16,441
But won't Yawanra-san become like one of them?

128
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,027
I won't let Yawara be like that.

129
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:27,410

133
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:42,050
For Yawara to go to Mji-haa College, she
had to agree to my strict candmions.

134
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,968
Strict conditions?

135
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,844

What's the use of going to college then?

144
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,367
What's wrong with a G o'clock curfew?

145
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:07,992


146
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,453

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,519


159
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,603
Absolutely.

160
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:42,861
Winning the World Cup open-weight class
is the same as wimning the gold medal.

161
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,030


162
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,323
Sansei, wha-t did you just say?

163
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:55,457
As I said, winning the World Cup upen-weight
class is the same as winnving the gobd medal.

164
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:55,749
As I said, winning the World Cup open-weight
class is the same as winning the gold medal.

165
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,626
Sensei, don't you know?

166
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,504
Know what?

167
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,553
It's hard to find Yaw-arwsan.

168
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:14,142
Ysah. There aren't any afternoon classes
today, and nobody's name.

169
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,855

00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:40,627


175
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,629
You didn't know, Sensei?

176
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,550
Judo World Cup is done by weight class.

177
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,470

178
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:50,887

00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,266


182
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,811
Judo is where skill overcomes strength!

183
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,730

262
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:52,504
Matsuda-san, it's good to be a workaholic,
but you shouldn't interview her at work.

263
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,588
Well, I...

264
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,676
Newspaper reportwrs shouldn't intrude
into Yawara-san's private rife.

265
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,220
What? Then what about you?

266
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,765
I don't need to answer private questiom.

267
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,724
Right, Yawara-san?

268
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,104
Well, Matsuda-sam the exit's that way.

269
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,773
That's not it!

270
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,948
I admit that I'm working, but I'm
not im-tenrv-iaewilng... it's sort of...

Kagawkuln! Why are you here?

276
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:51,938
I can find you where-var you are, because our
pilnxkies are bound by the red string of fate.

277
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,481


278
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,357
Just kidding.

279
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,067

Yawara-san, it's not true. Don't believe her.

300
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,359
What's not true? It doesn't matter to me- anyway.

301
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,405
Exactly. It has nothing to do with Yawara-san.

302
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,116
It's good to see you guys dnving we-IL

Alone? But, I have a curfew.

321
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,922
Everyone says that at first.

00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,968
No. I'll reserve an ocean View restaurant.

323
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,053

00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,136


501
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,055
I've never seen Sayaka-san like this before.

502
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,646
Is it because she saw Yawara-san today?

503
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,690
No, that's not all.

504
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:42,779
Sayaka-san is trying to take on the world.

505
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,115
