1
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,638
That's it for today.

2
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,397
College classes are so specialized.

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,439
I agree.

4
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,733
I wonder if I can hang on.

5
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,946
Oh, lnokuma-san, can you go?

6
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,613

00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,948
The golf club.

8
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:59,244
They're going to have a Z-day
camp at the new annex.

9
00:01:59,244 --> 00:01:59,536


10
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,870
A Z-day camp?

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,121


12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:01,621
Exactly .

13
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:01,871


14
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,376
We're going with the Meihou
males again. Let's go.

15
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:06,793


16
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,088
But, I've never really golfed before.

17
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,214
Thaufs okay.

18
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,675
We'tl be abie tn golf in no time.

19
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,928
And, we'll be able to get a boyfriend too-l

20
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,763
om.

21
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,403
I see. We have a problem.

22
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,490
I'm wre Grandwpa won't agree to it.

23
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,492
Do you want to go, Vawara?

24
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:45,623
Well, as a college student, I want
to experience many things.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,543
Then go.

26
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,503
Really, Mom?

27
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:57,010
Do what you want to do, Yawara.
Leave Grandpa to me.

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,094


29
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,346
All right!

30
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,416
Yawara! The National! Achievement Medal!

31
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,360

32
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,989
Has she fallen prey to that. Mii-haa College
and forgotten about practice?

33
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,826
Oh, Father. Yawara heft already.

34
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,955
She said it was a Z-day trip.

35
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,832
Lday trip?!

36
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,126
Don't tell me she went with guys!

37
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,548
She said it was a club function,
so I'm sure there are bays.

38
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,466


39
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:23,680
Ta... Tamao-san, why didn't you
stop her W you knew that?

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,139


41
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,807
Dont worry.

42
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:25,974


43
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,103
Yawara is in college already, so shQ
can do whatever she wan-ts to do.

44
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:30,603


45
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,188
Haw can I not worry!

46
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:38,111
You can say that because you don't know
how college students are these days!

47
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,403


48
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,531
So you know, Father?

49
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,451
Well, sort of.

50
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:53,460

delinquent glrl and retrain her from scratch!

55
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,282

56
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,120

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,914

Okay. Keep your eye on the ball
until you swing through it.

68
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,360
Like this. Don't be nervous.

69

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,777


163
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,822
When it's important, he has no balls,

164
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,072


165
00:10:56,072 --> 00:11:00,035
Other than dealing with females,
he's a total wimp.

166
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:00,702


167
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:07,876

She might win the gold medal for sure!

174
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,949
That's if she can beat lnoku-ma Varwaara.

175
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,827


176
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,041

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,880
Daily Every. You don't seem to undemtand.

179
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:58,343
It should be obvious that I'm much stronger
than hnakuma Yawara by watching me.

180
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,512
It's true that you became stronger.

181
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,264
But, lnokuma Yawawra is stillll stronger.

182
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:03,598


183
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,018
And. she shines brighter than you.

184
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,978
Shines?

185
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,148
It's a false shine.

186
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,902
I"I'I peel off that fake metal

Hey, Fujiko'san, who is that?

286
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,209

290
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,762
That's me, E years ago.

291
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:47,127


292
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:47,794
That's amazing You studied ballet
abroad in grade school?

293
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,505
Theirs amazing, You studied hamlet
abroad in grade school?

294
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,089


295
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,341
I was in the Bowllle Cihez ballet troupe for a bft.

296
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:53,508


297
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,844
That's amazing. You're awemme.

298
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:56,761


299
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,054
That was a lung time ago.

300
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:03,059
I'm sulrprised that you were
such a great ballerina.

301
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,979
I did ballat day in and day out.

302
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,398
Ever since I was B years old.

303
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,526
S years old? That's just h'lke me .

304
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,193
What?

305
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,862
Oh nothing.

306
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,574
It was a super-heavy schedule.

307
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:25,206
I grew Ulp without playing g'ilrl games,
like tea parties and dolls.

308
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:25,623


309
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,875
I know.

310
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,670
No, I mean, that: bad. Didn't you hate it?

311
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,298
No. didn't mind.

312
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:39,763
I wanted to become Japan's best...
No, the warld"s best ballerina.

313
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,223


314
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,475
Why did you quit?

315
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,729
There aren't any primna donnas
ISO centimetars tall.

316
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,817
I started sprouting in junior high.

317
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,404
I.n hiw school, I grew like crazy

318
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:04,496
It's because my mom is NO cm, my grandma
is US cm, and my grandpa is mo cm.

319
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,956
It's a family trait that no ane cam stop.

320
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,959
But I still triem

321
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,089
I woul-dnlt eat, and I'd sleep in a small bed.

322
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,466
But it was useless.

323
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:24,015
There aren't any toe shoes that
fit a Z?-cenrtimeter foot.

324
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:29,521
without ballet, I had mrhilrg. I was so depressed.

325
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,942
So, when the col'lege entrance exams
approached, I made up my mind.

326
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,988
Since l"m a normal girl now, I'm
going to enjoy a normal life.

327
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:45,995
Become a normal co.Llsge wumaxn, fall! in love, and
wear pretty clothes to enjoy my second youth.

328
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,998
But, I can't seem to do anything right.

329
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,252
I must have used up an my luck m ballet.

330
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,753


331
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,132
It'll be alright. Cheer up, F uj.ilko-san..

332
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:57,257

343
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,577


344
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,954
But, I need to go home soon.

345
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:28,371

352
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,015

How could you spend a night with boys!

354
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:53,605
Did that Mii-haa Conllege already
corrupt you to oblivion?

355
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:53,897
Did that Mii-haa College already
corrupt you to oblivion?

356
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:54,439


357
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,441
I was with my club members.

00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:56,691


359
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,610
You're aver thinking. Grandpa!

00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:58,902
Yau"re over thinking. Grandpa!

361
00:21:58,902 --> 00:21:59,819


362
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,987
Over thinking?

363
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:01,071


364
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:05,658
You think you can throw worm-class
aplpvonent's with such a weak attack?

365
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,163
World-class opponents? What

Cup. You're going to be in i-t.

368

Rumors say that it'll be a gathering of world-class
apupnonents just like the Olympics.

372
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,599
I refuse to go.

00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:34,229

375
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:38,566
Listen, Yawara. If you didn't have
judo, you don't have anything laft.

376
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,402
You have absolutely nothing.

377
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,154

That's the timing, Don't forget that timing.

Grandpa is still angry. This is going to bite.

388
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,165
You won't be able to handle the world-class
opponents at this rate!

389
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,376
