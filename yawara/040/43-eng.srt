00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:31,383


2
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,509
Kaga-k uxn !?

3
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,385
What are you doing?

4
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,636
Hurry up!

5
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,722
Kosaku, stop calling me Kagavkun.

6
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,556
Call me Kuni-chaun...

7
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,933
Gah!

8
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,559
Thae hell with "Kuni-chan!"

9
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:46,231
We better hurry up or the plane that
Tamaranch is on will be here-l

10
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,774
Why are you in sunh a rush?

11
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,652
Wouldn't you be happier to
have a ptettier girlfriend?

12
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,153
Give me a minute.

13
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,571


14
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,948


15
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,156


16
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:55,990
What's this!?

17
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,129
The he" with girl-friend.

18
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,256
We are here for a job.

19
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:11,715


20
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,091
I know.

21
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,928
We would make such a good couple
if we weren't here for a job.

22
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,887


23
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,596
This is hapeless.

24
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,982
Even the big political figures are here
to greet President Tamaranch.

25
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,485
Oh, man, they look HIKE a bunch of
ants that found a pile of sugar.

26
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,403


27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,488
Ozh, Miss Savyaka!

28
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,615
Long time no see you!

29
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,993
YOJLI are even more beautifull
than last time I saw you.

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,202


31
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,997
That is true, I mean, not true.

32
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,330


33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,126
You too, President Tamaranch, you look younger.

34
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,546
Yes, that's true, I mean, not true.

35
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,137
Oh my god!

36
00:02:59,137 --> 00:02:59,846


37
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,890
Wow. Hon'ami Kinnusuke and
President Tamaranch!

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,683
There they are, two old friends.

39
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,143
Kaga-kun, take the photo!

40
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,019
Kimchan!

41
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,604
Tama-chan!

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,231
Serioualy?

43
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,108
What a conversation...

44
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,694
Are you Tame-Chan?

45
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,612
Nice to meet ycu.

46
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,322
J-imJigoro-san!

47
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:17,530


48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,408
l"m the man who ruled the All Japan
Tournament   years in a row,

49
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,619
I mean, b years in a row.

50
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,287
I a-m l noku, ma Jigom, Yth dan.

51
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,207
I mean, S'th dan, I mean, ?th davn.

52
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,044
Hey, would you like to have a talk
with me over some sweets?

53
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,711
Hey, would you Like to have a talk
with me over some sweets?

54
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,045


55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,171
What?

56
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,383
Sensei. what are you doing here?

57
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,967


58
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,805
It's no use trying to tel'l him
about Inokuma Yawara..

59
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:46,142
He would not deal with a country girl like that.

60
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:46,935


61
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,311
I'm not talking to you.

62
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:48,561


63
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,358
Tama-chan, I want to have
a nice long chat with you

64
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,903
About holding a free weight class
campetftion art the World Cup.

65
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,821
What do you think?

66
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,322
Oh, good.

67
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,199
I love tempura very much.

68
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,328
How rude!

69
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,288
Listen to what I have to my!

70
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:07,831


71
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,833
Listen up!

72
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,961
Judo without a free weight class is not judo!

73
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,713
The "ju" stays the "go."

74
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,382
That is the true meaning of jludo.

75
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,803
l willll show you how powerful
the true judo af Japan is.

76
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,058
He got intimidated.

77
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,561
Tama-chan is intimidated by my enthusiasm

78
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,770


79
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,232
I"m sorry, I don't know what...

80
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,900
DOM worry, Mr. Tamaramh.

81
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,950
I almost died from oxygen shortage.

82
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,664
This is the biggest mistake of my life. trying to
convince those who don't understand Japanese

83
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,334
Semei ,

84
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,211
I don't know what you are trying to do,

85
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,630
but Mr. President has a press conference,

86
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,091
so you should talk to him at
the banquet tomorrow.

87
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,553


88
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,096
I'm terribly sorry.

89
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,266
He is not a suspicious man.

90
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,726
He is a suspicious man.

91
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,353
He is very famous.

92
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,312
He's a judo master.

93
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,105
Oh, a judn maaenr.

94
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,023
Yes.

95
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,696
That Kazamidori speaks fluently.

96
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,325
I wiH save the true battle until
the banquet tomorrow.

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,826
Got it, Tame-Chan?

98
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,285


99
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,288
I wonder what he was doing?

100
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:30,997


101
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,500
Let's go to the press conference site!

102
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,335
Oh, wait, Kosavku!

103
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,295
He is serious

104
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,799
He is really trying to convince President
Tamaranch to hold the free
weight class competition.

105
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,094
All right, I'll act big at the press conference too!

106
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:44,344


107
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,181
Why don't you calm me out with that energy tom?

108
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,102


109
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,187
If you turn your shoulder along with your arms,

110
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,066
the left arm will remain straight naturally.

111
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,109
Like this...

112
00:05:59,109 --> 00:05:59,693


113
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,152
Keep it up, Fujiko.

114
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,195


115
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,197
Start your second youth.

116
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,573


117
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,410
Yes, I am reborn now.

118
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,245
From toe shoes to clubs.

119
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,163
From the stage to the fairways

120
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,334
And I will find that which will excite
my heart like I did back then.

121
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,753
The entilre sports worid is corrupting!

122
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:24,300
S-ir, there is a person I really would
like you to meet during this visit.

123
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,262
By the way, I wonder what
is up with Inokuma-san?

124
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,014
She's been acting quiet since that day.

125
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,724
I should mik to her today.

126
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,224


127
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,851
Thank you for the meal.

128
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,602
I know you willl be very shocked,

129
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,438
once you see Iwnokuxma Yawara!

130
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,023


131
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,860
Excuse me, we will conclude the conference
if there are no further questions.

132
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,570
Wait a minute!

133
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,865
She winlll become the biggest topic
of conversation at the World Cup:

134
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,201
And I want you to remember this name!

135
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,870
Ilnukwma Yawara!

136
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,663
Remember knokulma Yawara!

137
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,832
Hey! Preaaident!

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,792
Let me go!

139
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:04,507


140
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,633
F uji'ko-san?

141
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,801
What, all of a madden?

142
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,094
Dont play dumb.

143
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,138
I found out everything.

144
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:10,805


145
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,473
About what?

146
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:11,931


147
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,266
Oh, came an.

148
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,268
Why are you trying tn hide it now?

149
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,395
llnokunma Yawera's shocking debut.

150
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,190
Inozkurma Yawara wins the All Japan competition.

151
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,069
It wasn't easy to find all these archives!

152
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,530
Oh, Fujllmo-sarn, that's not me.

153
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,698
That's someone else.

154
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,283
Why are you hiding it?

155
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,578
I remember it now.

156
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,541
It was one Sunday last summer.

157
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,840
Back th an, just aftar being forced
to give up being a ballerina,

158
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,927
I was living at my home in Shtizuoka without
beilng able to find any new gems,

159
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,138
and I was j ust spacing out in from; of the TV.

160
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,392
I was just staring at the screen,
not really watching iT.

161
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,143
There it is!

162
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,394


163
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,312
Another prxpaon Zecvi!

164
00:07:59,312 --> 00:07:59,771


165
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,814
She's strong-E

166
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,274
She wins with an iwppon within three seconds'

167
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,944
This is an incredible newcomer!

168
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,824
She was glowing incredibly.

169
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,077
I didn't know a thing about judo, but I could tell,

170
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,619


171
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,957
that she is a girl who will became the best in the
worlncl - the very thing I was trying to achieve.

172
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,292
That was you, lnokurma-san!

173
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,549
Thank you, Inmkumaesan!

174
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,970
I decided to give my days of yomh
a try again because of wu.

175
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:37,225
I realized that I shouldn't just sit there
when I saw you shining so brightiy.

176
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,811
I decided to give my best at
the college entrance exam.

177
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,230
This is so excftilng!

178
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,815
You are that girl!



179
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,693
I have a friend who will become the world's best!

180
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,319
Wodd's best?

181
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,029
No...

182
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,991
You will enter the upcoming World Cup, right?

183
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,827
I know you will be chosen as
the representative for it.

184
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,081
I will not go.

185
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,332
Why?

186
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,752
You can be on the world stage.

187
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,670
There is nothing as wonderful as that.

188
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,966
I dnn't want to be good at judo.

189
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,344
You misunderstand,

190
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:16,931
Your wonderful ballet and my violent
judo are completely different.

191
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,183
We in t?

192
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,601
No, ifs not.

193
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,311
Your judo is wanderful.

194
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,689
It was so much more beautiful than my ballet.

195
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,400
You saw at the disco.

196
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,987
Can you believe a girl threw a guy?

197
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,490
That's not the same thing,

198
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,491
That's enougm.

199
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,577
P'leme don't talk about it anymme.

200
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,413
About the World Cup or judo.

201
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,628
lnokuma-san. . .

202
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,638
President Tazmaranch, welcome to our banquet.

203
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,057
Oh, Saya'kal

204
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,394
You look beautifuxl and wonderful again today.

205
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,772
I am the future heroine of the world.

206
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,023
This is natural.

207
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:11,611
Men wouldn't leave such a beautiful
girl as you alone, would they?

208
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,656
This is my fiance'

209
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,033
I see.

210
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,868
He is such a lucky man.

211
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,582
I would have been your rival only
if I were a little younger.

212
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,960
My, ynu are so honest.

213
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,506
Kazamatsuri -sa ma,

00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,468

215
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,428
A guest?

216
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:41,766
Ohv I might steal Sayaka from
you while you are away.

217
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,019
Oh dear, Mr. President.

218
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,649
Go ahead. be my guest.

219
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,029
Sheesh, the heck with my fiancese'

220
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,114
Who is it?

221
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:56,489


222
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,366
Over here, Kazamidori.

223
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,495
Mvr. Inokuma!

224
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,039
ls Tama-chan here?

225
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,249
Why are you dressed like that?

226
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,751
Stay calm.

227
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,044
Lend me your ear for a minute.

228
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,007
The free weight claw?

229
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,716


230
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:19,346
That's impossible, str, to make President
Tamaranch hold a free weight class campetjtion.

231
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,638
I can do it,

232
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,641
if you do me a favor.

233
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:23,933


234
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,518
Do you want me to interpret?

235
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:31,816
Sure, I studied abtoad in England when
l was young, so I"m fluent in English.

236
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,694
But this is completely different.

237
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,491
I diidn't ask fat your bragging.

238
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,034
Will! you help me or not!?

239
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,246


240
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:50,794
Sensei. I can help you, but with one condition.

241
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,628
A condition?

242
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,045
Yes.

243
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,006
Trying to play a game?

244
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,050
Oh well, tell me anyway.

245
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,390
I'd be grateful if you allow this.

246
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,977
I want official permission from the
head of Inokuma household,

247
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,562
for me to date Yawara-san.

248
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,439
Are you crazy!?

249
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,817
You are Sayaka's fianca!

250
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:14,192


251
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,362
lifs just a selfish promise between two parents.

252
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,446
Let me be harvest.

253
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,324
The giri I'm really attracted to is Yawara-san.

254
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,831
Flnlf: .

255
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,039


256
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,208
R-reaUly?

257
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,167
Do whatever.

258
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,796
But you must help me with
everything I ask of you.

259
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,047
Of course!

260
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,465
Yes!

261
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,176
There is nothing to fear with his permission.

262
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,053
Be glad, Yawnra-san!

263
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,430
Idiot!

264
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,434
I will not allow her to date anyone until
she gets the People's Honor Award.

265
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,200
What?

266
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,994
Who is moaning?

267
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,413
Farther, I'm scared.

268
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:14,002


269
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,587
Kazamatsuri-san?

270
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,840
D-d-d-don't be intimidated, Shinnosuke.

271
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,051
This is all for going out with Yawara-san.

272
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,221
I-l-l-wl hope the party is going well f-or you.

273
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:30,018
N-n-now, as a gesture of welcome
for President Tamaranch,

00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:38,568

00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,694


276
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,781
Kazamatsuri-san is making a
speech in front of a crowd...

277
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,075
He has grown up.

278
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,078
Master lnokuma Jigoro, come on up!

279
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,128

You useless slow ass!

289
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,741
Brain less scum.

290
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,244
A pea brain wimp.

291
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,161
Damn...

292
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,287

293
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,123
Yo' mama so fat!

Olld scum!

297
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:53,727


298
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,311
Did you see that, Tama-chan?

299
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,896
I could be Inokuma Ya-wara.

300
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,773
He is the heavy weight wrestler.

301
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,400
The "ju" slays the "go."

302
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,652
A small fighter throws away the giant!

303
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,903
Thafs free weight ctass!

304
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,697
That's the true form fit for Yawara!

305
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:05,905


306
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,240
What do you th'xinkq Tamavchan?

307
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,908
Don't you want to see that at the World Cup?

308
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,368
The true jludo!

309
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,537
The true Yawam!

310
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,039
Translate that, Kazmmatwri!

311
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,338
How shameless!

312
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,382
Who do you think the guest
of honor for this party is!?

313
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,970
Your family is always trying
to hog people's attention!

314
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,931


315
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:37,896
Kazamatsuri, did you me their
faces when I made that throw?

316
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:38,563
Yeah. . .

317
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:43,276
Tama-chan realized the greatness
of the true jludo, didn't he?

318
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:43,902


319
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,445
This is so fun!

320
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:50,241
Lady Sayaka looked like a
deer caught in headlights.

321
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,076


322
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,870
So, how did Tame-Chan react!

323
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,454


324
00:15:54,454 --> 00:16:00,627
He was so shocked, and exclaimsd "Oh, I will
hold free weight class matchesl", didn't he?

325
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:08,176
Master Inaku ma, a-a-a-actuavllly. . .

326
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,305
What! ?

327
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,098


328
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,182
Kazamats utril

329
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,393
Did you really explain everything to him!?

330
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,020
Sense-I, please calm down.

331
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,772
Shut up!

332
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,693
I explained more than enough,
including how great you are.

333
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,903
Then why does he say it was a sham?

334
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:32,283
He just can't believe the fact that a small
man Ililke you couhd throw a large man.

335
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,245
Shees'h !

336
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,124
He doesn't understand things even
after he gets to see my greatnms?

337
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,626
That block'head'!

338
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:46,631
Filne, I'll show him How great Yawazra really is.

339
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,049
But. . .

340
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,679
Prasident Tamaraynnch is haading

00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,513
Today?

342
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,639
Yes.

343
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,145
He leaves right after he sees the future
hopeful wresthers at Saiikai University.

344
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,522
Oh, Saiikaj University, huh?

345
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,481


346
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,607
Yes.

347
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,695
I have a gnod idea.

348
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:13,033
Keep tellling Tama-chan how great the
free weight class cmmpetitian is.

349
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,492
Yea. . .

350
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,036
But, .

351
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,788


352
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,957
You're out of this already?

353
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,586
Then I can't allow you to date Yawara,

354
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,879
Fill duo it!

355
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,173
Leave it to me, Grandfather!

356
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,300
Grandfather?

357
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,384
Oh, uwh...

358
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:44,939


359
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,275
Olh, fantastic!

363
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,493


364
00:17:56,493 --> 00:18:00,705
She can thirdW such a large person!

365
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,457
Thars it, Mr. President.

366
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,584
Indeed, that's "ju" slaying the "go."

367
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,713
Do you see what Master Inokuma
meant at the banquet?

368
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,217
Man, judo's greatness is all
about free weight class"

369
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,512
Mr. President, Hon'ami Sayaka may be strong,

370
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,431
but there is someone even stronger.

371
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,391
What?

372
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,770
You see, Miss Yavwara ix more than Sayaka.

373
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,647
Hold on a second, Mautsuda-san..

374
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,316
We declmned all requests for interviews today.

375
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:33,947
Besides, I will explain evelythilng about the
free weight class and about Yawara-san.

376
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:39,035
Why do you have to sel-l Yawara-san when you
are the exclusive coach to Lady Sayaka?

377
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:39,494


378
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,537
No comment.

379
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,751
Anyway, Mr. President, I really want
you to see Yawara's match.

380
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,171
It will reallly make you want to hold
a free weight class competition.

381
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,049
I have heard about Yawara llnokume too.

382
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,635
Where can I see her?

383
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:55,760


384
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,262
Weill. . .

385
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,139
Oh, man

386
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,641
Yawara-san is not on any judo team.

387
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,145
Nor is it a good idea to take him to her house.

388
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,772
Don't worry about that.

389
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,648


390
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,568
Yawam is very special strong

391
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,527
Hold it.

392
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,447
You don't need to mind about anyone but Sayaka.

393
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:15,947


394
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,158
It's my freedom who I go after.

395
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:18,783
What! ?

396
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,415
Matsuda-san, sorry, but I have permission from
Master Ilnokwma regarding Yawara-san.

397
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,709
What do you mean "permission?"

398
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,294
I told you, no comment.

399
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:34,549
l dunk know wha-t he told
you, I wiilll not allow that!

400
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,053
I don't need any permission from you.

401
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,972
Kazanmats uln'wsan !

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,267

00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,519
I'll be looking forward to the
day I"Ill see you again.

404
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,271

405
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,734

407
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:05,163

class match no matter what it takes!

408
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,000

410
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:11,211

00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:24,391
You just need to throw a couple of
judo wrestlers in from of him.

416
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,141
Huh! '.'

417
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,726
You've got to be kidding me!

418
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,644

Obesity is a big name for any athlete!

426
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:42,325


427
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,493
Damn, you are heavy!

428
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,498
Yawarra! You tricked me again!

429
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,000

430
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,419

00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,470
We are terribly sorry, lnokuma'sama!

450
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,138
Inokuma?

451
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,474
Are you okay?

452
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:48,767
Are you hurt anywhere?

453
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,727
No, I'm okay.

454
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:51,644
But...

455
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,355
llnokanmsam

456
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,652
That's Yawaara'san.

457
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,070


458
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,780
Please let me go!

459
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,241
But Master Inokuma is in trouble.

460
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,034
That's not true.

461
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,119
rt must be a sham.

462
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:08,995
Let me go!

463
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,121
Please let me go!

464
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,623
Let me go!

465
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,250
Please let me go!

466
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,102
Oh, no! I did it again!

467
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,605
So that's Inokuma Yawara's Ippon Zeoi...

468
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,817
That was frighteningly fast and compact

469
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,111
Uim, I'm sorry.

470
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,362

00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:43,613
I'm sorry!

472
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,575
If! was holding on to her."

473
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,830
Are you shocked, President Tamaranch?

474
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,747


475
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,333
But that's not an she has.

476
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:55,750


477
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:01,256
If you want the true strength of Yawazra-san, you
should hold a free weight class competition.

478
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:01,798


479
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,010
The women's free weight class
competition at the World Cup!

480
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,513

00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,768

483
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,654

Because I knew yuu were faking it,

486
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,620
What! ?

487
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:39,627
My body could be gsttilng old from all the training
it took me to become an Sth dam in jludn.

488
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,962
