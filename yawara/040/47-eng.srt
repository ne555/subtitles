00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,556
The Judo Warlnd Culp is undarvmy hare at Semull.

2
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,811
The heated even-t gtarts with wikg class matches.

3
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:48,525
In this class, Hon'avmj Sayavka of Japan has
performed well, as expected
of the medal favorite.

4
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:48,608
She has won all matlghes with
ippon's up to the semi-Finals.

H

5
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,028
She has won a-ll matches with
ippon's up to the semi-finals.

6
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,488
Af?

7
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,366
Hon'ami Sayaka will aroceed to
the final if she wins this match!

8
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,286
Will the uth-imata be good!?

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,498


10
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:03,915


11
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,916
Yuwko!

12
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,042
Close I

13
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,544
n was cuff by a little.

14
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,761
Ounr commentator is Mr. Yamwhita.

15
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,179
What do you think?

16
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,140
Men's judo is great too,

17
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,144
but woman's judo is really attracting
the world's attentian.

18
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,688
I realty cam: take my eyes off of them.

19
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,067
Hon'ami Sayaka and evenryone
else are medal favorites.

20
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,152
Begi n !

21
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:38,867
And especially notable is Inc'kuma
YEWEer of the free weight class.

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,163
Seriously?!

23
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,415
Now, Sayaka-san!

24
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,250
H-hey!

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,879
Did Yamashitawsavn really say
that he knew your father?!

26
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,213
Yeah.

27
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,884
He said that he saw him I'm front of this Chang
Chung Gymnasium just the other day

28
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,136
He did?

29
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,890
I'm a litthe reijeved.

30
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,894
Just as I thought, he is in Seoul.

31
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:24,079
Dad must be watching me
somewhere in this gym.

32
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,206
Mr. Yamashjta knows...

33
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,750
He knows Mvr. Inokuma Kojiro.

34
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,251
Now!

35
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,797
Ippon !

36
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,590
She's done ft!

37
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,051
Han'ami Sayak'a made it to the final!

38
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,218


39
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,469
Yay'!

40
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,638


41
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,598
Magnificent work, lady.

42
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:43,807


43
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,558
Good job, Sayaka-san.

44
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,812
Hon'ami Sayaka wins by input:
with a graceful haraigash'i.

45
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:56,778
The final match of the  Skg Class will!
be against Kim Yonsuku of Korea, who
has already won her semuiwfinml.

46
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,875
Wonderful.

47
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,752
Exzellemt, Sayaka.

48
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,213
This is baring.

49
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,631


50
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,298
What?

51
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,721
Sayalm IS finally challenging the gum medal!

52
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,599
I need Lady Sayawka to get much much stronger.

53
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,521
She is far, far from being Yawara's rife-lung rival.

54
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,064


55
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,900
She is so good  but still not good enough?

56
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,698
Just like this Marugame HOFIIPD has
tried their best to get the best taste
out of Tsubumochui for BBQ years,

57
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,994
you can never be strung enough in juado.

58
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,038
That is so deep.

59
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,664
You should read thinsu

60
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,124
It has my autagrawpxh too,

61
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,710


62
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,129
You've made it to the Wnal, Sayaka-san,

63
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,131
Sayaka-saan, this is great!

64
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,632
You will be fine at this rats.

65
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,135
Of course, lnokuma-san.

66
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,636
You don't have to remind me.

67
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,182
I know very well how strong I am.

68
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,101
Well, well,

69
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,688
once- you win the  tSkg class.

70
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,608
it WWII give good momentum to the
rest of the Japanese Team.

71
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,609
right, Yuma-radian?

72
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,151
Right.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,652
Once I win?

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,654
Good luck. Sayaka-sa-n.

75
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,409
l"rn not your opening act.

76
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,620
S Sayavka-san!

77
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,956
Yawara-san didn't mean it like that!

78
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,083
Right, Yawara-saln?

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,917
ND.

80
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,211
You meant it, right?

81
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,381
Outsiders should stay out of this!

82
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,675
Let me make this. clear.

83
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,803
This event was hue-Id just fur me.

84
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:51,935
In ether words, I will make it clear
who is the queen who has both beauty
and xtrength, lnokumawsaan.

85
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,728
.Nl-

86
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,856
I don't need any words of encouragement
from you.

87
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,900
The retvult is ahready clear.

88
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,863
Kazamatsu:ri--sa:n, let's go.

89
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,158
Please don't mind her. VHwara-sam

90
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:07,617
Right.

91
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,495
Sayaka-san is human too.

92
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,706
She must be getting edgy right
before the big match.

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,464
X

 
Are you Yawarag peppy?

94
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,966
No!

95
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,093
He is not Yawarak boyfriend.

96
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:25,510


97
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,720
Jody.

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,513
So. is he...

99
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:29,973
Yes!

100
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,558
He is my boyfriend.

101
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,729
He is a really strong weight Lifter.

102
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,398
He came to support me.

103
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,653
He got your boyfriend wrong,

104
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,362
Tha-t's him.

105
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,990
Olh, he is!

106
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,373
I don't think he got it wrong.

107
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,499
YOU see...

108
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,626
Ignore the idiots.

109
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,086

110
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:00,587

00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:01,588


113
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,797
Kazaumaxtsulri-san.

114
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:02,964


115
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,424
Hey!

116
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,468
He is my boy-friend!

117
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,218
Let him go!

118
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:13,099


119
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,936
He said if you make Yawara
cry, hue"ll get you back.

120
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,313
I won't!

121
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,439
I swear I wont!

122
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,857
Okay!

123
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,485


124
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,487
Kosaku! What were you dolingl?

125
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,365
He would tear me apart if I didn't say that!

126
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:28,531


127
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,784
Jody, you got it all wrong,

128
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,618

129
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,163

00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,218

He is a really strong looking boyfriend.

141
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,638
Once the world cup is over,

00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,014

Nice to meet you.

lrs Kim!

155
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,349
The star of Korean judo, Kimn Yonsuku.,
is making her entrancev

156
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,810
She is completely callrn right

She heats up quietly.

158
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:47,152
On the other hand, here comes the gorgsuus
new star of Japan, Hon'ami Sayuka.

00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:47,962


182
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,714

186
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,261
Inokuma-san, be strong.

187
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,721
I'm with you.

188
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,185
I will fight against Yawara l-nok'uma.

189
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,520
You two are not called for.

190
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:08,942
Sorry, but I promised her that we
would figmt at the Worid Cup.

191
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,234


192
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,821
So we all want to fight against
Yawara Imkunma, right?

193
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,031
Um...

194
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,493
This is one helluva scene.

195
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,285
Kagwkun!

196
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,496
Where the hell are you!?

197
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,414
Excuse me!

198
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,582
I am doing my job, and taking the photo.

199
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,667
Farget about the match!

200
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,085
Take them!

201
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,220
Why are they making a scene out there?

202
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,473
tnokuma Yawara!

203
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,227
You always, always, always
are thirsty for attention!

204
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:47,897
Sayaka-san!

205
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,231
Sayaka-san!

206
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,443
Saya-ka-san!

207
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:54,946
W'aza ari!

208
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,700
It's waza ari!

209
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,037
Hon'ami trips from fom's sasae tsyrikumui ashui!

210
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,205


211
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,915
S-Sayaka-san!

212
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,000
My lady!

213
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,710
Come on, Sayaakwsan!

214
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,378
Get your usual self back!

215
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,629
The match has anly begun!

216
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,965
Oh, shuxh!

217
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,634
I can't concentrate because you are trying
to take away people's attention!

218
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,805
Watch, Fm only getting serious now.

219
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,140
Just watch right there!

220
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,351


221
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,226
Begin !

222
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,608
That's right, I'm only getting serious now.

223
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,778
Watch, Inokuma Yawara!

224
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,572
No!

225
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,240
You are not positioned well for that!

226
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,122
Yuwko!

227
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,500
Kim is dearly in the lead!

228
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,001
Now she has a yuko on tap of a waza ari!

229
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,127
Honhmi is in a pinch!

230
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,604
Darn, they are fighting entirely at Kim's pace.

231
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,398
Calm down, Sayaka-san!

232
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,150
Stay calm, Sayaka-savru.

233
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,443
You're almmt out of bounds.

234
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,152
Come on!

235
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,904
How naive.

236
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,368
I have no interest in other people's matches.

237
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,537
I"m only interested In my own victory.

238
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,417
I get sick to my stomach watching
people cheer for other people,

239
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,794
Yawara is different from you.

240
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,504
She can afford to do that.

241
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,841
She has completed hm awn judo.

242
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,885
She is not interested in her own victory.

243
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,264
Thafs splendid!

244
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,016
I can't wait to fight against her.

245
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,100
Right!

246
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,270
I get excited just thinking
about a match with her.

247
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,981
Sameone who has completed her own judo, huh?

248
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,192
How wi'l.l I be talked about if I beat that?

249
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,363


250
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,364
Out of bounds!

251
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,283
Hun'avma' is not doing wel'l.

252
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,577
She cannot find a single chance to fight back.

253
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:12,375
Kim has gotten much stronger than the
lam time Sayalka-san fought her.

254
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,711
Can this mean. .,

255
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,421
No, iu: can't!

256
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,213
It wiill be fine!

257
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,381
You can win, Savaka-san!

258
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,969


259
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,931
With Kim's large lead over Hon'alrni,
there is only one minute left!

260
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,808
What do yuu think, Yavmashita-san?

261
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,102
I want her to be calm.

262
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,397
Han'amf is not performing her judo.

263
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,441
She cannot attack HIke that.

264
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,197
So, Sayaka cant. ..

265
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,115
No, she can't win like that.

266
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,451
Although there are plenty of ways to attack her.

267
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,370
Jigoro-sennsei!

268
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:54,626
She has good potential, but thats axlll we'll see.

269
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,587
Time is passing quickly.

270
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,714
Can Hon'ami find her way out?

271
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:04,219


272
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:04,511


273
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:04,761


274
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,514
Kim is stulil aggressive with her attacks!

275
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,890
f
There are m secondi left!

276
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,768
I,
The crowd is going crazyi. for Kim!

277
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,317
Now !

278
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,819
Right there!

279
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,946
Sayaka-san! Grab the back collar!

280
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,950
This will be good!

281
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,118
This is good.

282
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,997
Yuwko!

283
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,836
That was dose for Hon'amui!

284
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,170
She makes her came back with a haraligoshi!

285
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,548
It was dodged slightly to make fit a yukn!

286
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,135
That was so close.

287
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,849
Tha-t advice was l'hokunrna
Yawera's VOICE, wasnT it?

288
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,184
Thavt is an incredible sense For judo.

289
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:53,768


290
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:58,148
Inokuma Yawalra has a truly
polished Sense for j-udo.

291
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,402
Vawara. . .

292
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:07,157
Let's hope that Hm'ami Sayaka
will bring the flaw to her favor.

293
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,666
Kim is being cautious about kosh-iwwaza
because of that hmigmhi..

294
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,418
Ashrwaza will be effective here.

295
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:19,961
Right there!

296
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,754
Trip hear!

297
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,675
Waza ari!

298
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:25,967


299
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,010
Deashvibara-i !

300
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,511
Hnowami takes a waza ari!

301
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,679


302
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,805
Yes!

303
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,474
Sayaka-san, that's great!

304
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,476
Be quiet!

305
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:41,232
If others heard that, they w-iIEl think that
r'm attacking just following your advice.

306
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,194
Your ideas just happen to match mine.

307
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:44,986
Don't bother me!

308
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,072
Sayakawsan . ..

309
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,950
She is number omne in the sizE of her pride.

310
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,454
They both have a waza ari and a yuko each,

311
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,955
The match is tied norw.

312
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,208
The crowd is cheering for Kim again.

313
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,544
But the cheer for Sayaka is there too!

314
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,381
The Chang Chung Gymnasium
is filled wfvth excitement.

315
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:09,386
For the itskg class tine, Hnon'ami Sayaka and
Kim Yomulku clash for the last time!

316
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,388


317
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,436
Why?

318
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:22,899
Why can I hear Inokuma Yawara's
voice among all the noise?

319
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,859
Ten seconds left!

320
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,944
They are both aggressive until the end!

321
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,071
Will the victor be Kisml?

322
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,239
Oir Hon'amin

323
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,740
Seven seconds left!

324
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,658
Six !

325
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,493
Fm!

326
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,494
Three!

327
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:36,538


328
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,289
Sayauka-san, back collar!

329
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,130
Hon'a'm-i's haravigoshi!

330
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,673


331
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:46,756


332
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:46,840


333
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,969
Iit's good!

334
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,895
Hon'ami makes a gut! pose of victory!

335
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,066


336
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:05,692
Na

337
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:12,741
That's it.

338
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,786
The judge has not declared Hon'ami"s ivppon yet.

339
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,288
What is going on?

340
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,873
She ran out of time.

341
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,128
Wham! ?

342
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,088
What were you looking at.!?

343
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,675
D-idn't you see my graceful hauraigosni?

344
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,092


345
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,261
Hon'ami makes her claim!

346
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,514
But the match clock sure says no time.

347
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,557


348
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,725
It was too late.

349
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,684
What?

350
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,519
It was too late.

351
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,271
Aftef Hon'ami grabbed the back collar,

352
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,148
and right before she performed the ha-raigashi,

353
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,692
the judge declared the end of the match.

354
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,360


355
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,655
Because of the loud cheer,
Hon'axmvi could not hear it.

356
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,657
Sayaka'san...

357
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,869
Hon'ami withdrew her claim grudgingly.





358
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:07,087
Ihave to wait for the judge, not being
able to take an ippon in such a match

359
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,925
Winning by judge's decision
won't make me happy.

360
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,177
How will the judges call the match?

361
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,262
They both have a w-aza awri and a yuko each.

362
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,597
They are complemly equal.

363
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,099
White flags means Hon'ami,

364
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,267
red flags means Kim's victory.

365
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,811


366
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:23,770
Score!

367
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:30,652


368
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,778
Red wins!

369
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,661
Kiwm won!

370
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,995
Hon'ami is beaten!

371
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,758
Hon'ami's retaliation started too late.

372
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,678
Kim had too much of a lead at
the baginnilng of the match,

373
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:01,933
and the last haraaigoshli was nut counted toward
the pea-int because it was aftar
the match was over.

374
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,355
Sa'yanka-sanl

375
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:09,315
Sayanka-san!

376
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,319
Sayaka-san!

377
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,158
She could not make it come true,

378
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,077
but Sayaka-san's goal is Yawara-san.

379
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,664
And to lose against someone
else right in front of hen.

380
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,250
It must be the greatest pain to her.

381
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,335
Sayaka-san...

382
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,044


383
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,086


384
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:40,889


385
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:41,139


386
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:41,222


387
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:41,306


388
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:41,389


389
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:41,473


390
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:41,556


391
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:41,639


392
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:41,723


393
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:41,806


394
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:41,890


395
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:41,973


396
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:42,098


397
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,562
Vou ng lady,

398
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,318

00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,737
and were enthmsnred as a queen.

400
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,907
But you couxlnd not rule jludo,

401
00:19:58,907 --> 00:19:59,449


402
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,825
Holding back is not good for you.

403
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,411
Cry to your heart's content.

404
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,413
As ilf I would cry!

405
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,999
The only time I will cry is

406
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,501
when I beat I:nnokulma Yawara,

407
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,087
and after becomimg the true queen of the warld..

408
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,506
I will cry for joy.

409
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,050
How couhd I dare cry UMII then?

410
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,926
How could I...

411
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:25,350
Looks like I was right at judging you
as the damned rival of Yaw-arm

412
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,186
Lady, ymu will get much stranger!

413
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,107
Let me gfve you something good.

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,150
It has my autograph"

415
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,031
Read that and study a lot!

416
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:44,411
And get much, much, very much strongxxr,
and came back to face Yawara!

417
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,914
As the strongest rival in existence.

418
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,168
Of course.

419
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:52,502


420
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,878
That's the splint!

421
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:07,058
Lady, you could have relaxed a bit longer.

422
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:11,062
Anyway, the match is over now.

423
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,566
You can now rest for a while.

424
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,236
My match is not over.

425
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,781
My new battles have just started.

426
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:27,037


427
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,329
