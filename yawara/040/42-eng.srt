1
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,638
This is strange;

2
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,975
This is the college life I've dreamed of,

3
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,155
But...

4
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,534
it's not fun at all.

5
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,462
Grandpa is still being himself."

6
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,881
Attend me World Cup!

7
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,300
And you better become the champion!

8
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,239
Disco?

9
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,198


10
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,116
Yes.

11
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:42,871
It's another party with thne golf
club from Meihn University.

12
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,959
Huh?

13
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,753


14
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,254
nnokulma-sam

15
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,256
It's disco we are ta-Ilking about!

16
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,591
Don't you want to go?

17
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,179
It's not that."

18
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,555
Curfew again?

19
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,769
Then just tau him that you are
wurkixng on a report with me.

20
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,480


21
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,731
I could.

22
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,026
Dancing is so nice.

23
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,735


24
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,906
Forget about mrything and dance,
and it'll make you feel great!

25
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,284
You can trust that coming
from a former ballerina.

26
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,535


27
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,456
Eu-t, F u'jiiko-san, isn't disco completely
different fmm ballet?

28
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,185
If Grandpa found out that I went to a disco...

29
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,313
A discol?

30
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,069
Disco and ballet are different...

31
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,362


32
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:02,450
But just obeying grandpa doesn't do any ..

33
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,083
I think I will...
I think   will...

34
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,043
I"Il go to the disco.

35
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,714
Really?

36
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,633
I' ll feel better if you are coming.

37
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,345
But this wilrt be my firQ: disco too.

38
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,393
Let's start with finishing luwnch now.

39
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,403
IOC President Tamaranch i s visiting Japan!?

40
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,112
Yes.

41
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,906
I invited him.

42
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:51,833
After all, President Tamaranch and my father
Hon'ami Ki.nunosuk,e are very close friends.

43
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,629
He said he would love to toms ta
support me at the World Cup.

44
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,675


45
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,428
Hey, you, would you ask for permission
before you take photos?

46
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,307
If you are shooting from this angle,
wowld you back up a Little?

47
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,266
It"l'l be fine.

48
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,728
My skill allows me to make anything look pretty.

49
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,897
What do you mean anything?

50
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,984
The H un'am.i Group and President Tamaranch's
relationship has become even closer since
the Los Angeles Oiympic Games,

51
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,903
in which corporate sponsorship became popular.

52
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,239
lit's not a sexy shot, so stand normal.

53
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,783
This is normal.

54
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:31,081
So Hon'ami Group is involved in
the upcoming Worhd Cup too

55
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,624


56
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,377
That's pretty good. Matsuda-san.

57
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,046
So, you do more than chase after gossip.

58
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:44,135
Only one representative will be chosen from
each country foa' each weight class.

59
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:51,101
I thought the choics was finalized for the
ItEkg class with the match the other day.

60
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:57,065
Are you talking about the Japan Cup
that I farfeited, Matsuda-san?

61
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:02,362
That was purely accidental.

62
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,948
Right, Kazamatmn-san?

63
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:18,586


64
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,046
Yes, that's right.

65
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:28,430
If I had attended the final match, I
would have beaten Yawaura easily.

66
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,097
Yes E

67
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,765
Just thmw her away!

68
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,224


69
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,103
My, we agree in this case.

70
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,271
Yes!

71
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,982


72
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:46,239
Besides, don't you think a World Cup without
me is like breakfast without caviar?

73
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,328
The entire world is waiting
for my wonderful judo.

74
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,538


75
00:06:53,538 --> 00:07:01,212
People will rush to see how I throw away
the enemies from all over the world.

76
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,424
The coltisewm will be in a great heat.

77
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
I wonder about that.

78
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,509


79
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,844
WhatE?

80
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,806
Jody Rockwell who fought Yawara to a standstill.

81
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,727
And Anna Teleshiikava who beat Jody.

82
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:22,233
Will your judo be good enough against them?

83
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,738
Your judo which was beaten in the blink
of an eye by lnokurma Yawara!

84
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:44,589
You see, this is why you are
stilt! a third-Irate newspaper.

85
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,426
This concludes the interview.

86
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,012
Please come see my matches for the rest,

87
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,513


88
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,349
Tokunaga, the guests are going home.

89
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,311
I 'll see how long you can keep that smile!

90
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,563
Good Luck, Sayaka-san!

91
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,278
Matsuda-san is absolutely right.

92
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,905


93
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,325
There is no time to be laughing, Sayaka-san!

94
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,496
At your current skill, you are...

95
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:50,697


96
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:50,780


97
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:50,905


98
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:50,989


99
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:51,072

Fu'jiIko-san!

102
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,959


103
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,627
The sound is very loud.

104
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,628
What?

105
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,922
The sound is very loud.

106
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,885

Disco is beyontagglief.

109
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,888
Disco is beyond belief.

110
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,807
My ballet is no good here.

111
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,392

No. I'm builldiing up my strategy.

122

Strategy?

123
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,783
Right.

124
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,453
I'm trying to master everyone's steps perfectly.

125
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,580

00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,928
I just picked him up over there.

141
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,098
He's a med student, and owns two beame'rs.

142

Yawara!

00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,545
Yawara, are you not home yet:!?

153
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,964
That girl, breaking curfew again!

154
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,342


155
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,012

Yawawra just called eariier.

157
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,098

158
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:40,932


159
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,435
Are you sure she didn't go to a disco?

160
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,185


161
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,145
No.

162
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,106
I doubt that.

163

00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,095
I dan't want it!

174
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,764

00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,599

No!

177
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,358
I don't Understand.

178
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,025

Would you dance with me?

184
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,374
No, no. I'd be better.

185
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:47,916


186
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,041

I drove today.

214
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,581
What is it?

215
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,918
That's cowl.

216
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,884
Fu'jiiko-san!

217
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,315
You're back. you bad girl!

218
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,193
The heck with the college life-!

219
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,904
You're still only a kid...

220
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,991


221
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,075
tpa.

222
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:45,325


223
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:45,408


224
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:45,533


225
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,206


226
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:51,414


227
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,671
Hey, this is grown up...

228
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,257
Jeez, ol-d scum!

229
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:09,933


230
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,394
It's not my fault.

231
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,605
It's your fault for acting Hike a thief.

232
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,440
You touched it far free-I

233
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,483
Who's the thief herel?

234
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,859
You stay quiet!

235
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,405
Even you haven't touched it yet.

236
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,490
Shut up!

237
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,034
So, what happened to Yawara-san?

238
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,703
I know you want to touch it.

239
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,830
What happened to the G o'clock curfew,

240
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,916
and the b hours of training in
the morning and at night?

241
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,294
It is none of your business.

242
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,340
So it's all because she went
to Mitsuba Junior College.

243
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,385
Why did you let her go there?

244
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,762
She was suppased to fail.

245
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:54,102
She was supposed to f'a-ill the exam
because of the hand iinjlulry.

246
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,147
However. ..

247
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,984
I know why.

248
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,861
It's because Kasaku helped...

249
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,743
Well, it's already done. so we can't help it,

250
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:16,166
By the way, did you know that President
Tamaravnch of IOC is coming to Japan?

251
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:16,666


252
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,084
Tama...

253
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,086
Tamarannch . . .

254
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,508
Oh, you perv!

255
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,845
Ta, Ma, Ra, N, Ch!

256
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,181
Hon'amli Sayaka invited him!

257
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:37,937
Hon'ami Ki rmosuwke and President Tamaranch
are wch close friends that they can go

258
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,857
"Wassup, Kin-Chan?" "Not much. Tammchan."

259
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,233
Isn't that incredible?

260
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,777
KilntE. . .

261
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,784
Is he that great of a guy?

262
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,118


263
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,412
We'll, sure...

264
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,498
He s the greatest of the greats.

265
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:01,920
Is he so great that he can change the World
Cup however he wants with his order?

266
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,714
Well, he's the executive supervisor of it.

267
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,389
Ma -chan ,

268
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,727
you know how there is no open weight
division in the World Cup?

269
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,729
Yes...

270
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,608
Doni you want see a match between
Yawavra and Jody in the World Cup?

271
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,276
Well. of course.

272
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,737
l"m sad I won't.

273
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,365
I 'II let you see it.

274
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,661
You'll see that big match at the Warhd cup.

275
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,919
No, that's impossible.

276
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,797
There s no... open...

277
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,677
You mean, you're gonna ask
President Tama raunchn

278
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,472
Thafs impossible.

279
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,933
Even if you aak the president, I don't think...

280
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,602
That's so absurd that it's not
worthy of writing it up.

281
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,903
I cant wait for the world cup.

282
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:41,144
Yes, that's it, Fujiko!

283
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,334
Huh?

284
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,921
Huh? lit became un-iet all of a sudden.

285
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,047
I-t's the cheek time.

286
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,132
Cheek time?

287
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,444
Please don't.

288
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,405
Oh, come on, let's enjoy it.

289
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,448
Piease stop.

290
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,449
Let me go.

291
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,249
WeTe done with the interview now.

292
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,835
Let's go on a date, Kosaku.

293
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:48,461
Huh I

294
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:54,050
Sure, it'd be great if there's
an open weight division.

295
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,593
But...

296
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,428


297
00:18:56,428 --> 00:19:01,474
Oh, you're upset because I let
h-im touch me, aren't you?

298
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,477
It's just too impossible to ask for.

299
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,521
But...

300
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:13,028
When he wants something, there's
no reasoning or whatever.

301
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,907
Oh, you're jealous!

302
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,952
Please don't.

303
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,539
Hey, about the talk earlier.

304
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,877
Let's go down highway E in my car,

305
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,211
and watch the nice View from the Bay Bridge,
Stop it.

306
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,632
and watch the nice View from the Bay Bridge,

307
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,217
and than...

308
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,185
off to a nice hotel by the seaside.

309
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,177
No way...

310
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,360
Oh, no!

311
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,071
We done it again!

312
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,085


313
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,548
I've dnne it again!

314
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,050
Inuk umav-sann! Wait!

315
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,476
Ivnokurmawsan !

316
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,021


317
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,772


318
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,275
Hue touched youxr bottom!

319
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,947
How rude-l

320
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,157
L

321
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,993
So I jlust tried to brush him off...

322
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,870
Brush him off?

323
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,746


324
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,415
That happened just by brushing him off?

325
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:35,545
Jlust brushing off caused a person
to fly through the air...

326
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,464
It was an accident.

327
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,884
He accidentally trilpped right then.

328
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:44,095


329
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,097
Isn't that judo?

330
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,807


331
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,894
Oh, what are you talking about?

332
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,104
What is this judo thing?

333
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:58,360
IlnokuIma-san, I reallly think
I have seen you before.

334
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,696


335
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,075
We only met for the first time
at the entrance carenmany.

336
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,619


337
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,037
Oh, no!

338
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,332
I better get home soon, or grandpa will be mad.

339
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,834
I need to take the New Keio Line.

340
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,711
You're takilng the JR Line, right?

341
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,587
See you

342
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,437
That was bad.

343
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:34,813


344
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,314
Maybe she noticed.

345
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:43,822
No girl would throw a guy with an Ippon
Zeoi just by having her bottom touched.

346
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,325
I'm not normal.

347
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,246
My body moves before I think.

348
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:59,754
I'm a living weapon.

349
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:17,439


350
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:24,738
l"m home.

351
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,657
The hall with you're home!

352
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,785
It's way past the six o'clock curfew!

353
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:31,995
I'm sorry.

354
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:36,332
I will make them hold the open weight
divisinn competition at the World culp.

355
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:40,587
Only trailning awaits you, so you better wiwn!

356
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,466
Next Yawara -

357
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,427
An Open Weight Division is
the andy way for Yawam'a.

358
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,805
You bzetner watch it, our l"l.I
