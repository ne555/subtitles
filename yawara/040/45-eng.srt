A huge banner at the stadium sayilng,
"Go! Inokuma Yawara!"

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
I don't need that.

10
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:02,789


11
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,125
Don't hold back, lnakmma-san.

00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:05,542

I thought we could go to Seoul
for cheap or something,

18
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,348
So we're just watching it on TV
and chearing from here, right?

19
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:20,724


20
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:26,271
Even if it's from Japan watching TV, our feelings
wm travel across the Sea of Japan...

21
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:26,479


22
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,733

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
Wait a minute!

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653


28
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:39,659

00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,382
Hello, Yaw-are!

36
00:02:54,382 --> 00:03:05,810


37
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,232
lnokumwsan, is this person going to fight you?

38
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,280
Of course, Yawara and I are SHUUMAI rivals.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,822


40
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,949
You mean SHU-KUME'I rivals, Jody.

41
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,411
Yes, SHUKUMEl rivals.

42
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,162




43
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,748
By the way Jody, are you completely healed?

44
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,460
Thank you for OPPAL

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:30,794


46
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,128
You mean SHllNPAI.

00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,382
See, I'm back to my best condition!

48
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,216


49
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,300
That's nice.

50
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,763
You helped me recover quickly.

51
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:46,351
The motivation to fight you again helped
me the whole way through.

52
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:46,685


53
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:51,272
And finalllly, I can fight you at the
World Cup's open-weight class.

54
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:51,606


55
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,359
The S'HUUMAI fight!

56
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:54,567


57
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,111
You mean SHUKUMEI fight.

58
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,654
Yawavra.

59
00:03:59,155 --> 00:03:59,656
Yes?

60
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,285
This time, we fight... for real.

61
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,579
Yea...

62
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,747


63
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:13,461
I didn't know... that in judo, you
fight this kind of athlete!

64
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,840
Leaving already, Jody?

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,173


66
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,551
I had a long break.

67
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:19,759


68
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,470
I need to catch up with my training.

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:22,887


70
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,016
The Canadian team is training at Nagoya.

71
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,141


72
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,310
I see. If only you could stay longer...

73
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,273
How about the Japanese team?

74
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,024


75
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,403
It's already begun, and Grandpa went
to Saikaii College to coach them.

76
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:38,528


77
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,073
Olh, Jigoro-sansei's coaching is outstanding!

78
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,323


79
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,992
Don't you need to go soon, Yawara?

80
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,200


81
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,784
Yes.

82
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,410


83
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,536
And Yawam'a.

84
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:46,703
vx

85
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,120
Huh?

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,204


87
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,291
Be careful of Russia's Teleshikcwa.

88
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,959
Yawara, you're strung.

89
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,005
But, Teleshikava IS strong in another sense.

90
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,174
In another sense?

91
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,134


92
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,011
There's more strong athletes?

93
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,349
Yes, Belgium: Belkenns is very strong.

94
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:07,474


95
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,101
She is Judds Queen.

96
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:10,518


97
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,645
She's a terrifying queen!

98
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,022


99
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,608
But we're strong, too,

100
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:16,900


101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,527
The W-ourLd Cup is going to be exciting,

102
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:19,736


103
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,155
It will decide who the world's strangest woman is.

104
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,032


105
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,742
Worhd's strongest...

106
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,493


107
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,994
linokumaI-san.

108
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,621


109
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,289
H! see you at Seoul.

115
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,762
That newspaper reporter.

116
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,308
Yawalra, it might get difficult for you, but your
fteady boyfriend will help you through it all.

117
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:50,684


118

00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,772


120
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
No, we're not.

121
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,358


122
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,484

00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,632

00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,342
Why don't you calm down, Mom?

130
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,343
Oh, that's true.

131
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,096
What? What's wrong, Mom?

132
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,306
We", Yawara.

00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:37,939

00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,940
No, no good.

136
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,234
Sayaka-saan, youre not putting currently.

137
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:41,484


138
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,655
You won't be able to defeat Kim, the
ulnuder :takg athelete with that.

139
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,618
Kazamatsulri'san.

140
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:56,124
You're so irritated because you
cant be alone with me, right?

141
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:56,958
Uh, no...
You're so irritated because you
cant be alone with me, right?

142
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,083

00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,172
So, let's snaeak cm of here tonight

144
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,010
I'm sick of the camp food.

145
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,513
Charles' dog foud tastes better nun that.

146
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,810
Yawara-san. what's taking you so long?

147
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,441
Jingom-sensei, is Yawara-san here yet?

Dacha at Seoul?

149
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:37,374
Yes, a judo affiliate that knows Dad told me.

150
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:44,506
According to Korean judo athletes, some
Japanese person gave them one-point lessons.

151
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:54,015
The sharp execution and speedm they've
never seen anyone so strong.

152
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,185
The physical description was so much like Dada

153
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,607
Dad is in Seout.

154
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,280
Hey, how many times dn I have

158
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:14,703

159
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:14,869


160

I'm so glacL Really glad.

168
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,222


169
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,265
Yes, thank you.

170
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,307


171
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,059
Come change over here.

172
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,768


173
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:43,606
I knew she'd come around eventualiy.

174
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,569
Always, always, always!

175
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,449
She shows up late and steaks the Show.

176
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,616
That girl!

177
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,747
Rsaully, she should at least greet
us first for being so late.

178
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,831
Absolutely.

179
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,709
My, we actually get along, Toudau-san-

180
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,084


181
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,711
Let's spar, Hon'amui-san.

182
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,463
Yes indeed.

183
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:22,354
Miss Eelkens, why does a beautiful
woman ri-ke yourself do judo?

184
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,732
Are there any secrets you'd hike to share?

185
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,734
Any comments about Japanese men?

186
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,781
Jludo is the most exciting hobby for me.

187
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,034
That Luxurious twinkling helps me win.

188
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,660


189
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,037
Oh, amazing.

190
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,333
But Russia's Teleshikova didn't
even consider you her rival.

191
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,000


192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,837
Teleshiikova stated that her biggest
rival is Japan's llnnokuama Yawara..

193
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,380


194
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,633
How can you make such a rude
comment, Daily Every!

195
00:09:52,884 --> 00:10:01,351
Yawaura Ilnokuma. She's also someone
that excites me the most,

196
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,270


197
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,648
Stop dlroal'i-ngl

198
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,570
SayBka-san, aren't yau tired?

199
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,989
Shall we take a break soon?

200
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,202
I need to coach other females also.

201
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:19,452


202
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,455
Oh, I'm Filnne.

203
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,251
Because, we are the envious gnldewn paw.

204
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,338
Your have blows away any sort of
exhaustion. Kazama-ts'ulriwsan.

205
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,465


206
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
Is that so?

207
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:33,758


208
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,136
Lets keep practicing.

00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,599
Yawaara-chan B so cute.

210
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,436
Is she really that strong?

211
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,022
I"!l ask her to spar with me.

212
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:53,695
Hey, you're the middleweight representative, so
dam: think about girls until after the World Cup.

213
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,113


214
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:59,909
What are you saying? I really
just want to spar with her.

215
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,954
Yeah right, ifs written all over your face.

216
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,372

217
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,960

Umum .....

221
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,263
Ogawawxan, let's change over now.

222
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,308
Mo, give me another SO minutes.

223
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:29,481
You're really Fired Up as the apenwwreight class
representative, shouldenIng Japan's dreams.

224
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,201
I'm sorry. Are you all right!

225
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:47,123
Hey buy, your left arm pull
is still weak as this candy.

226
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,626
You wanna dn PiOO mock throws?

227
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,002

228
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,462
Yawam, you too!

229
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:57,300
What was that sluggish, halfassed iwppon zeoai!

230
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,884
Sorry!

231
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,218


232
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,594
That was sluggish?

233
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,055
That was a perfect ilppon moi.

234
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:02,138


235
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,057
Sluggish, half-eased ippozn zewi?

236
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:09,396
If she improves it anymore,
how strong widll she be?

237
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,233
Ogawa-san, how abuuut a'parring with her?

238
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,946
No, I don't want to get hurt
befare the World Cup.

239
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,280


240
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,408
There s more to her than that.

241
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:21,991


242
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:29,374
The women's open-weight class was
pretty much made for Yawara-san.

243
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,501
I wonder what will happen there. .?

244
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,755
But, Yawara-san became so mature!

245
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,634
Always, always, always!

246
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,012
Why is she such an attention hog?

247
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:49,769


248
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,980
At this stage, i-t's all about intensity!

249
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,358
I'm going to take the open-weight
dass, Yamashitawsa-n!

250
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:55,650


251
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,029
That's the spirit. Eat some
more, the mea-t's done

252
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,658
Miss, can you get w more servings for us?

253
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:04,576


254
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,203
But, Yamasehlitmsan. ..

255
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:07,787
Hmm?

256
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,584
Thaer'e's something shocking about
the apenwweight class.

257
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,256
Yamash'ifta-san, do you know
Inakuma Yawara-san?

258
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,174
mm mm a !

259
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,927
Yeah. the female open-weight
class representative.

260
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:32,854
Ever since I first saw her, I've felt that
there's something more to her than
her mall, weakJooking stature.

261
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:39,402
When I saw her training at this camp,
I broke out in a cold sweat.

262
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,197
Her training?

263
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:50,413
You know the ilppon zeoi drill where ons person
grabs onto another person 'x belt for extra weight?

264
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,832
But, lnnkwma. . .

265
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:06,137
"threw both of them at once!

266
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:16,398
Right now, there's B peop-le total helping
in the drill, but if they don't watch
it, they might get thrown, tau,

267
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:23,697
This is the first time in my life that
We been sn afraid of someone.

268
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,492
I've had that feeling before, too.

269
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,159
What?

270
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:34,582
M years ago, when a man threw
me wiith an ipzpon zeal".

271
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,167
A man?

272
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,504
His name was lnokuma Kojilro.

273
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,007
Ilnokulmaj

274
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,595
I'm doing okay. Don't worry, Fujiko-san.

275
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,350
Yawara-savn..

276
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,144
Kazamauts'ulriwsan.

277
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:59,691
Even though we're under the same roof,
we still haven't had time to talk

278
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,236
Please spare some tume for me tomorrow.

279
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,363
Please, Yawara-san.

280
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,907
Uh, sure.

281
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,285
Welll, excuse me.

282
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,205
Good. Now it's finally paid off to be a mach.

283
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,207
Kazamatsulriv-san.

284
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,044
I was looking for you.

285
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,631
Oh-h, my body's dead.

286
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,593

287
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,260


288
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,886
I'm sleeping.

289
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:28,386


290
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,263
l 'm going to eat and sleep all! day.

291
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:30,597


292
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,557
Maybe I should too.

293
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:32,849


294
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,642
What are you doing tomorrow, Ilnnokwmawsan?

295
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,144

I'm going on a date tomorrow,
right, Kazamatgulri-san?

298
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,863
We're going to get away from
this prison-like camp.

299
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,118
Hon'aami-san goes from prison to heaven.

300
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,662
Lucky to have a fiance.

301
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:54,746


302
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:58,124
Heaven? Why, thats so true!

303
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,293


304
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,921
Kazamatsuri-san, right after
he said that to me...

305
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,880


306
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,345
Well. err, as a coach, I need to supervise
Miss Hon'avmi'x state of health.

307
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,681
ix

308
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,392
Kazamatsuri-san is absolutely right.

309
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:15,558


310
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,394
I need to watch my food intake also,

311
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:17,560


312
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,734
Unlike the barbaric open-weight
class representative,

313
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,235


314
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,072
I need to stay within my under
ng weight class standards.

315
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:29,322


316
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,740
Right. Kazamatsuri-san?

317
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,660


318
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,580
So, are you going on an eating
tour with your Grandfather?

319
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,957


320
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,792

00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,794

Or are you going on a date with that third-rate
sports newspaper reporter?

323
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,468

Because we're going overseas,
let's be fashionable.

333
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,070
What did you say?

334

Hmm. .. Fashion, huh?

343
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,385
"Softnass defeats brutality"

344
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,803


345
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:39,809
Inokuma Jigoro-sensei. your book has been
my bible ever since I was a child

346
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,439
You trained your son to become that strong...

00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:01,831

00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:03,583
