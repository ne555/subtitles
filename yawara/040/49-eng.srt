and Telesahi'kova of the Soviet Union.

00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:02,288
The best four have made their way to the top.

6
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,378
K-Kojiro-sanl

7
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,173
Your father is somewhere I'In this arena.

8
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,299
Yes.

9
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:23,643
Now, will it be Balkans or lnokuma
who will proceed to the finals?

10
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,398
Yawara, show me how strong you are.

11
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,027
I will show you how scary Judo is.

12
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,236


13
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,239

15
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,935
What's the matter with Be-lkens?

16
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,938
She jumped away as soon as
they grabbed each other.

17
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,732
What...

18
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,945
What was that?

19
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,411
Dirty jacket and an old hum-ting cavp...

20
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,415
Jacket and. . . hunting. . .

21
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,508
Out of bounds!

22
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,720
What's the matter with Bevlkens?

23
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,430
She won't stay in the game.

24
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,018
YamashiKta-mn, is this a part of her plan?

25
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,145
She's not just gtaying out of the game.

26
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,563
She can't stay in.

27
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,567
The moment they touched each
other, she sensed danger.

28
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,444
The danger of Ilnok'uma.

29
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,032
That's our queen.

30
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,993
She won't let herself be thrown so easily.

31
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:08,540


32
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,916
Damn!

33
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,170
With so many people, clothes
aren't a good enough due!

34
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,548
Ineed some other clue ..

35
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,552
That sawnd!

36
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,057
Thats the mulnd of rice crackers...

37
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,559
A weird mam?

38
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:28,935
Yuzp!

39
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,564
He was carrying a Lot of snacks
and stuff just like Jigaoro-saan.

40
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,774
I heard it somewhere!

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,278
Out of bounds!

42
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,696
That's it!

43
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,364
Keep going. Lnokugma san!

44
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,574
And then?

45
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,535
Hex so different!

46
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,038
Yes, she's different!

47
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,373
"He?"

48
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,209
Then he pulled ou-t Bathie dolls
and said "let's play house !'"

49
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,961
No way!
Then he pulled ou-t Bamie dolls
and said "let's play house!"

50
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,213
That's wrong!

51
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,757
Gash !

52
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,216
Hey, everyone!

53
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,051


54
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,761
What are you talking abolutl?

55
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,556
Inokuma-san its fighting so hard!

56
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,808
I know!

57
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,812
Thne opponent Loses when she flies
thruugh the air, right? Right?

58
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,523
I thought the one who trips is the losef?

59
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,651
Anyway, let's watch seriously.

60
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,569
Seriuu s Iv!

61
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,030
Yes.

62
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,578
Out of bounds!

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,954
Out of bounds.

64
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,456
She goes out of bounds again.

65
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,583
Balkans won't stay in the match.

66
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,002
She keeps runmng away.

67
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,671
The heck whh 'queen'l

68
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,092
If she's a queen, then Vawanra-chan is a goddess!

69
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,135
Where was in?

70
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,763
Where did it come from!?

71
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,566
Out of bounds!

72
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,070
She goes out of bounds yet again!


73
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,447
It's no match at all.

74
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,079
Belkens!

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,665
Instruction!

76
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,252
lit's an instruction!

77
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,715
An instruction is given to Balkans who
is completely on the defensive.

78
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,677
The title "queen" doesn't seem
to fit her hears, Yamashita-san..

79
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:31,558
No, it's because Balkans is so strong that she
knows how frightening Inukuma Yawara is.

80
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,060
We felt hike that too,

81
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,522
agaimt a man a Long time ago.

82
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,031
InnokUIma Kojiro-sa-n, right?

83
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:50,994


84
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,413
Wait, Kojiro-sam


85
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,250
I have to try.

86
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,044
lcan't win like this.

87
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,421


88
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,424
The two hold onto each other!

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,592


90
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,304
Now, how will you move, Yawaral?

91
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,682
Let me mruugh!

92
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,516


93
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,103
Wait up, Kojiro-san!

94
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:17,187


95
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:17,395

What's the matter?

What 's the matter?

I will!

154
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,588
Benlkens makes her move!

155
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,007
Itnokulma is in a pinch!

156
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,559
Wow, lnokuma is already in ilppon-zeui motion!

157
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,062
mu go!

158
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,735
Wow, Balkans hung on!

00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:11,282


160
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,534
Out of bounds!

Wait !

162
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,327


163
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:20,583
She evaded Ihokuma's Ixnpon-zeoi
by hooking her leg!

164
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:29,384


165
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,302
Wait wp, Kojiro-san!

166
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,020
She's...

167
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,604
She's strong!

168
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,861
She's... strong.

169
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,491
I can't baa-lime llnokuma's ippon-zeoi was evaded!

170
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,035
Idiot! We can't see!

171
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:55,869
Vou moron!

172
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,703


173
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:01,833
I wish I cqulud f ly there and
cheer for you! unokuma!

174
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,252
That was so close for lnokuma!

175
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,422
Bevlkens was barely saved by an out of bounds!

176
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:07,839


177
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,845
No, Betkens made her move, fearing
Imokuma's ippun-zeo:i.

178
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,599
So she can run for out of bounds
if something happens, right?

179
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,641
That's right.


180
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,062
I"m impressed with how quickly Belikens
reacted to Inokuma's ipponx-zeoi.

181
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,398
hooked her leg and got out of that situation.

182
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,317
Indeed, shek Queen Belikem.

183
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,321
But she can't win by just. being defensive.

184
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,447
Look at that.

185
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,034
Because of lnokuma's Last attack,
Belkens is even mare defensive.

186
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,624
Ouchigari didn't work.

187
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,542
Use hizaguruma, then deashi-barai!

188
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,837
No, it won't work with her sense of balance.

189
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,673
I need to take it to a grappling match

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,342
Grappling!

191
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,760

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,178
Out of my way!

193
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,846
Kajiiro-sarn !

194
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,806


195
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,104
Out of bounds!

196
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,272
..... Min

197
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,608
She's out of bounds yet agMn!

198
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
Benkens can only step back!

199
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,613
Benllkenns, warning!

200
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,702
If; a warming!

201
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:23,123
A warming is given to Belkens
on tap of the instruction!

202
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,376
She can only run away,

203
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,170
just like me that day.

204
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,839
She's done it!





205
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,383
Warning is the same as getting a yuko.

206
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,096
Balkans must score waza-ari Our better
to win against Yawara-sam!

207
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,140
The hell with points.

208
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,894
Them's no half-ass stuff like points or
a judge's decision in my book of judo.

209
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,106
To get or give ippan - that's the real judo!

210
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,859
Right. ..

211
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,155
Unless you get an ilpzpon, you never know
when the opponent will get an iplplon

212
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,032
and claam victory.

213
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,074
Look at that.

214
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,868
The queen is getting serious nuw.

215
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,555
Why are you running away, Kaero-sanl?

216
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,015
Yawara-san ix. ..

217
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:27,354
Your daughter is fighting, thinking that
you're watching her right now!

218
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,652
Damn !

219
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,408
There is less than a minute left now




220
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,494
How will Bellkens make her move?

221
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,375
Ican't rush,

222
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:48,583
Ican't rush.

223
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,043
She doesn't have much strength.

224
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,418


225
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:50,502


226
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,379
That's it!

227
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,047
What am I hesitaring for?

228
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,924
I have strength!

229
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:03,014
Bel kBTTS grabbed the back collar
and swung her around by force!

230
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,267
Now!

231
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,811


232
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,605
Balkans goes for sasae-tsuwrilkumi-ashl!

233
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,564
Yawavra!

234
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,735
t can do it!

235
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:15,860

And moves to inlpon-zeoi!

239
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,368
Bebkens hooks her lreg!

240
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:33,378


241
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,380
Balkans hangs in!

242
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,215
Are they gaming out of bounds!?

243
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,511
I gut you!

244
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,472


245
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,683
Inokuma brushed off her leg!

246
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:53,523


247
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:53,606


248
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:53,690
Fig .

249
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:53,773


250
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:53,857


251
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:53,940

00:12:54,274 --> 00:13:03,283


257
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:03,908


258
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,492
It's the same...

259
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,285
It's the same...

260
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,786
It's the same as Yawara-san's throw...

261
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:06,870
It's the same as Yawara-saws throw...

262
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,371
It's the same as Yawara-sams throw...

263
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,622
Sorry

264
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:14,794

00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,504

Let me go!

268
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,596
I won't!

269
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:25,972
Let me go!

270
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,601
No!

271
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,320
The match... must be- over...

272
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,822
Who...

273
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,282

274
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,843

277
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847

00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,267

286
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,325
Yeah!

287
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,410
Banzai!

288
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,619
Banzai!

289
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:30,912
Banzai!

290
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,747
S... she flew!

291
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,165
Wow...

292
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,625
I dun"t realll'y get it. but...

293
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,418
Did she win?

294
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,919
Did she jmt wtn?

295
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,547
Yawara-san. . .

Kojim-san!

298
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,974
That's right, Matsuda-kun.

299
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,104
Iwnokuma progresses to the finals
of the free weight class

300
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,232
It's a ray of hope for the Japanese j-udo scene.

301
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,791
You may be a new queen.

302
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,795
Um...

303
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,465
You are very strong.

304
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,967
Thank you.

305
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,974
Balkans raises Innkuama's hand in her praise.

306
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,490
Dad, were you watching?

307
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,244
Dad!

308
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:57,207


309
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,249
Jody!

310
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,376
Wow !

311
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,169
That was impressive!

312
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,463
Yawara, yuu're really strong!

313
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,508

314
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,009
I Will" win .

315
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,845
Wait for me, Yawara.

316
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:11,971
Yeah.

317
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:19,562


318
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,065
Beikens-san, give us a comment

319
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:26,444
You, the champion fawor'rte,
host iIn the semi-finals.

320
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,656
A new era has come.

321
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,826
My time is war now.

322
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:40,458


323
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,461
Tha-t match was the same as mine.

324
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:47,465
Oh, the on you were talking
about, with a certain man.

325
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:53,346
Yes, it was a match against Ignokulma Yawara's
father, Mr. lnokuma Knjiro.

326
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:02,480
I read your articles in Nilkkam Every Sports.

327
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,818
I hand a hunch that you were
that reporter Matsuda.

328
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,862
You write good articles.

329
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,282
You know what jxudso is.

330
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,492


331
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,328
I'm not used to being praised.
so this is embarrassing...

332
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,834
Forget about that!

333
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,965
Why did you run away like that?

334
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,178
Why havent you shown yourself
to Yawara-aaan all this time!?

335
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,512


336
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:39,100
Did you happen to have a match
with Yamasm'ta-san, and then...

337
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,062
You did?

338
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,189
Yes.

339
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:49,069
I had a match against Yawara-san's
father, Koj'ilro, fifteen years ago,

340
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,364
and I was throw-n just mkg Bellkevns just was.

341
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,868
I fell: like I coulldxn't stay an my feet at all.

342
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,288
I had just became the high school national
champian around that time,

343
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,083
but I lost completely against Mr. hnokulma Kojim,

344
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,753
and I realized, once again, how scary judo is.

345
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:12,133
And the next yuan he won the
All-Japan Judo Championship.

346
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,595
I trained myseixf very hawhly,

347
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,139
so I couwlnd beat lnokuma Koj'ilro!

348
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,058
And then?

349
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:26,022
At the end of that year, he visited me
at my new school in Kanagawa.

350
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,107


351
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:31,027
Yam ashita kun, you have become
strong, as if you're a new main.

352
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,072
Beating you now would be my proof
of being the strongest in Japan.

353
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,533
You wiil.l rule the world someday.

354
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,035
Biu-t I have that same goa-l as well.

355
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,674
Before or after that, I've never
had such an intense match.

356
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,220
So, how was the outcome?

357
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,225
That oucm'gari was just lucky.

358
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,776
In a meat desperate attempt, I tried ouchigari,

359
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,320
and it got him by luck, and I won.

360
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,612
and it got him by luck, and I won.

361
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:14,738
and it got him by luck, and I won.

362
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:14,821
and it got him by luck, and I won.

363
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:14,904
and it got him by luck, and I won.

364
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,113
and it got him by luck, and I won.

365
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:15,196
and it got him by luck, and I won.

366
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:15,363


367
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:15,488


368
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:15,697


369
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:15,780
Ii;

370
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:15,947


371
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,031


372
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:22,203
He disappeared right after that,

373
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,583
That man of jludo...

374
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:34,382
left for the journey of training to be truxly
strong just because of that ouch-igari.

375
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,968
I knew it.

376
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,847
You left for this jou rnney of training
to beat Yamashit'a.

377
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:47,354
But I awn stiJll far from mastering
the an of "Juu" beaming "Go."

378
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,271

00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,856
But she...

00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,441

381
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,276
Yes.

382
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,819

00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,405
She's had something from her birth.

384
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,243

00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,835


389
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,838

Yamashita-kun, sum, Kojiro was
shocked that he km against you.

397
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,742
Eu-t don't worry about that.

398
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,204
The main reason for his disappearance is not you.

399
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,665
Eavt.

400
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,002

401
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,211
That's right.

402
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,216
Dun't eat crackers in front of the mic.

403
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,218
The reason is her!

404
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,303

00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,305
