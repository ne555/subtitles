1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:38,890


2
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,808
Waza ari!

3
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,479
Kim wan!

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,147
Han'amli Inst!

5
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:46,856


6
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,732


7
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,150
Todo can't escape!

8
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,237
Yoko shniho gatame by Dutch, Hoffman is tight!

9
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,952
Don't take too munch time, Yawaraw

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,619
It's your tum.

11
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,455
Yes.

12
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,761
The gold medal! hopefulg, Hon'ami
and Todo lost unexpectedly.

13
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:21,266
Also in EZkg and iZkg classes,
Japan has not won gold yet.

14
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,394
Our omy hape left is lnozkuma.

15
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,896
Yamashliita-san, this was highly unexpected.

16
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,648
We can never tell what will happen.

17
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,527
That's what makes judo ilntgresting,
and also scary.

18
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,863
We can't be inure about Innokuma either yet.

19
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,865
Especially, because this is a free weight class.

20
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:42,120
Bellkens, Jody Rockwell, and Telneshikova
are also strong contenders.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,456
Any one of them can take away the gold medal.

22
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,582
Hanazono.

23
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,835
Senpai. I will be done soon.

24
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,170
Wash these too!

25
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,468
One of the gold medal contenders, Belkens,
just made her appearance.

26
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:01,973
The first match of the woman's JIundo World
Cup, free weight class campetitim..

27
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,099
I'd better hvurry!

28
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:03,683
Hurry !

29
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,642
Hurry!

30
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,021
Hurry up, or lmokuwma's match will begiln!

31
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,193
So he was like...

32
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,152
No way!





33
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,738
So, so, did you go all the way?

34
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,907
Huh?

35
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,367


36
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,659
Do you see wthriwmg?

37
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,246
Do you see anything?

38
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,584
No,

39
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,252
Nothing.

40
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,881
Why does it have to break now?

41
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,758
What is wrung with M?

42
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,053
It was working just earlier! But why!?

43
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:46,810


44
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,190
Fujilko-sam !?

45
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,817


46
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,779
I'd better hurry, or IInukuma-savn's
match will begin!

47
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,908
Be-lkens is good!

48
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,245
Canon of Sweden cant do a thing against her!

49
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,040
It's hard to imagine how strong she is whan
she's modeling in the fashion scene!

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,459
lppon !

51
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,087
Thare she goes! Queen Bellkens!

52
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,172
Her best move, Uchimata!

53
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,384
Oh, good job, Judo Queen.

54
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,969
Wonderful.

55
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,139
That's to be expected from the Queen

56
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,181
It's easy for her.

57
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,183
She didn't use even half of her potentiaL

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,146
But you can go easy only until
you have to face Yawara.

59
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,610
The next one up is lnokuma!

60
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,988
Our lnokuwma of Japan wmll be an!

61
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,406
I need to hurry or else...

62
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,158
lnokuma rsan's. . .

63
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:43,908

64
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:45,910

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,169

68
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,004
I don't undarsmnud what's gaming on!

69
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,255
I'm done for!

70
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,882
I'm screwed!

71
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,968
It doesn't work! I don't get it!

72
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,969


73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,928
Oh, ifs an.

74
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,431
llnokumm San!

75
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,558
It's really you.

76
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,394
Let's cheer for her!

77
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:11,686


78
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,395
Cheer?

79
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,817
Hurray! Hurray! Yawara!

80
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,944
Now?

81
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,616
What's wrong, everyone?




82
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,327
If we put our hearts into our cheer,

83
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,496
I"'m sure our voice will reach lnokumawsayn!

84
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,498

00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,834
Hurray! Hurray! Yawavra!

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,466
It's lnokuma!

88
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,010
Mnakuwma of Japan is coming!

89
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:49,516
Japanese Women's Judo team
has their hopes on her!

90
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,520


91
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,479

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,021

00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:10,847


125
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,639

00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,462
wacm, HSkg!

159
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,713
She's large!

160
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,967
Even for a free weight match, this
difference is almost crual.

161
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,719
That isn't fair.

162
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,264
Even for Yawaramhan, that monster is too...

163
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,724
Fools!

164
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,645
Hmn't you span-t enough
time with Yawaara-chaynl?

165
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,441
Yawara-chan could threw her
to the end of the universe.

166
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:11,241
Innokulma has performed many miracles against
numerous heavyweight wrestlers like Today

167
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,119
But she has never faced such a big athlete.

168
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,247
Yamashvita-aan, will the miracle happen again?

169
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:17,706
Miracle?

170
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,084
No, you canT keep winning with just miracles.

171
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:26,589
Begi n !

172
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,970

175
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,320
Fans in Japan, we're terribly sorry!

176
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,282
That silence was not due to a technical difficulty.

177
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:40,288
Not only I, but everyone in Chan Ch-uun
Gymnasium, was apeechlness fur a mament!

She's really done it!

180
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,878
Right after the match began,
she won With an ippon zeoi!

181
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:47,295


182
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,299
Two's wacm flew!

183
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,467
It's a mu'racie!

184
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,178
llnokuma performed a miracle again!

185
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,805
No, it wasn't a miracle.

186
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,266
It is the fruit of hnokuma's tenacity.

187
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,772
Ordinary training wouldn't give her that kind
of speed and sharpness in her throw.

188
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:13,822
She must have received umilmaginably incredible
training from Mr. Inmkuma Jigoro.

189
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:18,493
Sxixnce Judo was introduced to the world,
Power JIundD was getting popular.

190
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,329
If we are to compete with
grappling or joint locks,

191
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,207
Japanese cannot compete well
against stranger foreigners.

192
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,544
But Inoknma is fighting against the world

193
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:34,843
using the speed, sharpness, timing, and balance
that she learned in her younger days.

194
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,263
undead, than: "ju" slaying the "go."

195
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,435
Did you see that, Dad?

196
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:55,530


197
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,367
Hanazom, your classmate is incredible.

198
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,662
I've never seen such an ippon moi.

199
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,456
Innokulmal

200
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm extremely overjoyed right now!

201
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,210
YOU are...

202
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,503
YOU are...

203
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,257
I can't express my feelilngs anymore!

204
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,635
Hey, Hanazono, let us see Yawn-Chan.

205
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,305
You know her phone number, dont you?

206
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,932


207
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,769
I can't do that, even for you.

208
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,144


209
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,354
Why?

210
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,272
We'll buy you lunch if you tell us.

211
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,274
I can't.

212
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,904
Because she was my.

213
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,906
my first love!

214
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,200
Firm level?

215
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,745
Hey, Fuj'iko-saun, that was good and all,

216
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,205
but did lnokuma-san wivn?

217
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,290
She did!

218
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,541
Weren't you watching?

219
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,210
The opponent fiew in the air, didwn't she?

220
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,128
I WES.

221
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,715
But it happened so fast. so I didn't really get it.

222
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,217
I know.

223
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,761
You're dimmllt to work with!

224
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,889
If the opponent flew in the air,
that means Inokulmawsan won.

225
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,767
Next is semHinals, then finals...

226
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:10,480
After the opponents fly in the air two more
times, lnokuma-sam will win the gold medal.

227
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,441
I think I got it...

228
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,652
I"ve never watched judo before.

229
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:20,782
Anyway, she's going to keep throwing,
taking on our dreams!

230
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,659
Nnow, cheer!

231
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,118
Go!

232
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,953
Again?

233
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,623
Hurray! Hurray! Yarwavra!

234
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,959
Lauder!
Hurray! Hurray! Yawara!

235
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,003
Jody! Come on!

236
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,880
This is incredible!

237
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,883
Jody Rockwell's fierce attacks!

238
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,677
Looks Hike the ligament she broke last year
during the match against Telmhiknva...

239
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,803
Looks h'lke thg ligament she broke last year

M!

244
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,736
Jody !

245
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,698
You're number one!

246
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,075
Jody's fianca

247
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,540
Jody.

248
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,417
Yawara.

249
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,587
That's incredible, Jody.

250
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,796
Youlre really strong.

251
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,050
I can't get left behind by you.

252
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,552
Let'x fight at the finals.

253
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,096
Yeah. . .

254
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,401
And here she is, Yamashuita-savn.

255
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,613
The secret weapon of the Soviets,
Anna Telegmmva.

256
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,739
Yes.

257
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:47,744
She debuted like a comet
by bee-ting Jody mat year.

258
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,622
But her real potential is still unknown.

259
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,084
I sense a bottmmtess power from her.

260
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:59,589


261
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,554
Once the World Cup is over.
Jody will get married, huh?

262
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,475
lf they match up at the finals,
I want to cheer for both.

263
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,143
I know.

264
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,606
Once the World Cup ix wen
we should consider it too.

265
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,608
Consider what?

266
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,331
Marriage! ?

267
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,174
Begin:

268
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,724
This looks very tight!

269
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,060
Teleshikova's okulri eri-jiwme!

270
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,396
The winner of win championship
title last year, Telmh'ilknva,

271
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,359
moves from a flawless attack to okulri sari-dime!

272
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,401
Okuwri eri-j'i me!

273
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:49,407
I didn't expect her to use chukehoxlds when
her strongest moves are throwing.

274
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:53,912
lp pon !

275
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,871
That's all!

276
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,544
Tebeshuikova moves on to the
semli-vfilnavls with ease.

277
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,505
She did not even break a sweat.

278
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,757


279
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,925
This is eerie.

280
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:13,890
Wenlll, maybe it's because we just saw the very
active matches of hmkuqma emncl Rnckwell.

281
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,643
Eur thia silence is uncanny.

282
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,023
That army cut gal is hiding something.

283
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,081
Teleshdkma, I will wiln against you this time.

284
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,542
I will fight Yawaura at the finals

285
00:16:56,391 --> 00:17:00,979
Now we have the best four for the
World Cup free weight class.

286
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:05,150
The first match of the semi-finals is Belkens
of Belgium against Inokuma of Japan.

287
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:10,530
The second match will be Rockwell of Canada
against Teleshikova of the Soviet Union.

288
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,490
Jeez, all the bathrooms are full.

289
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:12,574
Jeez, all the bathrooms are full.

290
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:12,657
Jeez, all the bathrooms are full.

291
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,616
Jeez, all the bathrooms are full.

292
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,660
The gym is so humid.

293
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,663
I need to touch up my make-up
before the semi-finals begin.

294
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,082
Oh, no!

295
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,169
This ane is fun too.

296
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,422
Im sorry!

297
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,550
You're carryilng so many snacks.

298
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,719
YouIre like Jigoro-san.

299
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,846
Do you know lnmkuma Jigoro?

300
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,100
Yes, I'm actually in the press business.

301
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,560
That's good.

302
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:46,024
Excuse me, but would you take
this to Inakuma Yawara?

303
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,484
A letter?

304
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,863
Oh, you must be her fan.

305
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,365
It says To Yawara.

306
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,450
Oh?

307
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,871
Weirdo...

308
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:06,378
Nnow, Yawanra, if you fight like that again,
you're not my granddaughter!

309
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,463
Grandpa!

310
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,426
Taking Five whole secunds to throw
that good-for-nothing giant!

311
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,848
When I accomplished five... I mean,
six consecutive championships,

312
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,227
it dEidm't take more time than a blink of
an eye with all matches combined,

313
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,145
aalll the fans were in such shock that they...

314
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,021
tripped ,

315
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:25,939
hit their tongues,

316
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:26,731
their jaws dropped,

317
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,649
sprained their ankles,

318
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,566
sprained theilr fingers,

319
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,401
lost them teeth,

320
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,318
pinched their noses...

321
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,407
And here comes Bellkens.

322
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,701
Paophe are waving the flag of Belgium.

323
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:42,789
She has won five consecutive times in
the wodd championship TZkg class.

324
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,710
She is indeed the queen of the women's juado.

325
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,295
She's really popular.

326
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,840
She's so pretty, so of course.

327
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,762
And this is another loud roar!

328
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,390
Inokuma Yawa-ra of Japan just came in!

329
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:08,106
With her last match, she has instantaneously
captured the hearts of the people here!

330
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,275
Look !

331
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,111
Yaw-ara-san is as popular as Bel-kens too!

332
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,155
What kind of taste does everyone have?

333
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,281


334
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:20,160
Some weird man asked me to give
a fan-letter to her just earlier too.

335
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,661
A weird man?

336
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,330
It was funny too.

337
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,667
He was carrying a Lot of snacks
and stuff just like Jigoro-saan.

338
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,046
Let me See that!

339
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:37,052
If it's really a fanmlstter, he should have written
"To Yawara-san" or "To Yawara--chan.."

340
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,846
But he on ly wrote "To Yawara."

341
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,057
Kojiro-san !

342
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,350
Where was he!?

343
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,517
Where did you see him?

344
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,936
In from: of the south bathroom.

345
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,982
He was wearing a dirty jacket and
an old-looking hunting cap.

346
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,862
Oh, Komku!

347
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,989
Are you leaving me behind agalinl?

348
00:19:58,907 --> 00:19:59,949
Jeez !

349
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,243
Yawara-sam !

350
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,705
Yawaraaaan.

351
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,499
Yes.

352
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,219
Your father is same-where in this gym.

353
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,053
Yes.

354
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,264
You should just concentrate on your match.

355
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:23,973
Got fut?

356
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,308
Yea.

357
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,937
Leave the rest to me!

358
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,399
Pm watching over you too, Yawavra-ialn.

359
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,441
Kazanmyavtyulri-san.

360
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,985
You're glowing, Yawam'awsan.

361
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,404
