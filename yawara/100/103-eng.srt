1
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,410
Her opponent, Katori, is the only one entering the ring!

2
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,040
The arena is awash with angry bellows and calls for Inokuma!

3
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,360
Inokuma-san! Hurry!

4
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,090
Will Inokuma Yawara lose by default?!

5
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,550
Chief Referee! Wait!

6
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,700
Inokuma's here!

7
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,000
Tokunaga, we will order a wedding dress along the way.

8
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,560
S-Sayaka... san?

9
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,740
That's Inokuma!

10
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,560
She got a quick Ippon Zeoi!

11
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,660
Yawara-san?

12
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,040
Tokunaga! Get my judo gi!

13
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,990
She made it!

14
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,060
<b>Sayaka Surges Ahead!</b>



15
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,420
Bow!

16
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,190
Inokuma-san!

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,490
Is it really you, Inokuma-san?

18
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,040
Fujiko-san!

19
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,040
Wh-What did you say?

20
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,710
Inokuma Yawara's... at the Martial Arts Hall?

21
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,070
And she’s in the tournament?

22
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,590
Y-Yes, indeed she is, sir!

23
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,890
We really thought Inokuma-san was going to lose by default!

24
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,350
But unexpectedly,

25
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,370
she arrived at the last minute and did a smashing Ippon Zeoi!

26
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,360
Seeing it live was really intense!

27
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,730
Oh, is that right?

28
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,370
This isn't the time to be amazed!

29
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,250
If Inokuma Yawara is here, what's going on in Hokkaido, for pity's sake?

30
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,070
If Inokuma Yawara is here...

31
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,740
then she's not in Hokkaido.

32
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,770
Enough of that nonsense!

33
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,220
I'm asking who is dealing with Kato Chu Company right now?!

34
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,810
Oh, right. Well...

35
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,270
Find out the number in Hokkaido and call them directly!

36
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,810
Don't you care that our customer is worth twenty billion yen?!

Are you okay, Matsuda-san?

40
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,540
Oh, I'm fine! It's only a scratch!

41
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,190
Bone fractures are much more than a scratch, I'd say.

42
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,670
Fractures?

43
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,110
I-It's nothing serious.

44
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,590
I'm used to crashing motorcycles.

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,880
So you didn't come in here crying like a baby?

46
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm sorry. You were injured because of me.






47
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,520
What are you saying? It wasn't your fault!

48
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,660
I did it because I wanted to.

49
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,490
I wanted to see you fight Honami Sayaka and write an article about it!

50
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,250
Be sure to make it an awesome fight so I can write an awesome article!

51
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,710
Matsuda-san.

52
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,960
I'm sorry. I was wrong about you.

53
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,510
Your work is really amazing.

54
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,010
I-It's not that amazing. It's more like a pain.

55
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,350
Your articles excite and move people a lot every day.

56
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,610
Isn't that right, Assistant Manager Hagoromo?</i>

57
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,460
Their articles about your judo career always excite me!

58
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,750
<i>All Sports News</i> is the only thing I look forward to anymore.

59
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,790
It's thanks to Matsuda. Practically no one else writes with such gusto!

60
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,220
Where did that come from?

61
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,920
Whatever.





62
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,680
Anyway, give it your best shot! I'll keep hanging in—

63
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,690
That's right! I have to call Mr. Hagoromo and tell him I made it!</i>

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,200
what did I throw away my career for?

67
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,320
Sir?

Um, sir? Might you be Hagoromo-sama of Tsurukame Travel?

69
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,800
That's right, although I'm soon to be fired.




70
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,300
U-Uh, we have a phone call for you.

71
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,310
It's Inokuma-kun!

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,320
Hello? Did you make it?!

73
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,860
You numbskull!

74
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,280
M-Mr. President!

75
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,870
You blithering idiot! What the hell are you doing over there?!

76
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,290
I'll personally apologize. Now hand the phone over to someone from Kato Chu!

77
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,830
Our company president... knows!</i>

78
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,750
P-Please forgive me!

79
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,610
Forgive you, for what? Have things gotten that bad over there?!

80
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,720
Anyway, switch me over to someone from Kato Chu!

81
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,730
I'm truly sorry! Please forgive me!



82
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,420
What? Did you do something out of turn?

83
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,940
What are you doing? You moron!

84
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,670
I-I suppose Inokuma-kun didn't make it, did she?

85
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,290
I'm going to have your hide. That I promise!

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,820
S-Sir?

87
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,120
Where did that Yawara go?

88
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,510
M-Master Inokuma!

89
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,890
It's fine! She made it on time and unleashed a magnificent Ippon Zeoi!

90

96

You two are getting married!

97
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,430
Please...

98
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,640
Please lose!

99
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,800
This is Honami's first official match in a long time.

100
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
What do you think, Saito-san?



101
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,150
This match presents a problem.

102
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,520
After long absences, players often use too much power.

103
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,160
Will she be able to play judo at her own pace?

104
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,410
Hajime!

105
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,200
Her opponent, Fujihara, is known for being quick on the attack, but...

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Honami goes for a quick Ashi Barai!

107
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,590
Then for an equally quick Kosoto Gari!

108
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,600
She switches to an Osoto Gari!

109
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,250
She's...

110
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,760
Fast!

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,260
Fujihara's completely on the defensive!

112
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,280
Ippon! Done!

113
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,020
It's Honami with a speedy Uchi Mata Ippon!

114
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,430
So that's how she answers her ten-month absence?

115
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,070
That's amazing! Her surging speed, her series of moves...

116
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,780
She didn't give her opponent any opening at all!

117
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,230
Wh-What?

118
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,420
Now <i>this</i> is getting entertaining!

119
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,410
I can see that heiress got herself a helluva coach!

120
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,380
Beanpole! Be sure to show 'em what you've got!

121
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,640
Hey! You listening?!

122
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,760
She's too strong!

123
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,760
Relay this message to that tardy little girl.








124
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,700

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,990
Inokuma-san isn't going to lose to the likes of you!

128
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,500
Excuse me. Let me through!

129
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,500
Fujiko-san!

130
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,330
Trois!

131
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Ippon! Done!

132
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,550
Ito Fujiko is undaunted by Honami as she springs her Uchi Mata!

133
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,760
That's awesome, Fujiko-san!

134
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,420
Inokuma-san!



135
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,350
It'll be us in the finals, right?

136
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,680
We'll fight the final match together, right?

137
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,270
Yeah, we can do it!

138
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,770
Where'd you run off to, you danged scatterbrain!

139
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,990
U-Um, listen, Fujiko-san. I need to make a phone call.

140
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,260
Sorry to cut this off.

141
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,070
Hey, come back! Plant your tush right there!

142
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,540
I'll beat some character into you yet, you idiotic, tardy office girl!

143
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,980
Master, have patience!

144
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,540
Lemme go! Lemme go, you moron!
Master, have patience!

145
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,000
Hello? Huh, he's still not there?

146
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,510
He must be there.

147
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,710
W-Well, um, you see...

148
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,440
Say that I'm not here!

149
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,020
It's probably either my company president or my branch manager calling.

150
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,490
Where did my assistant manager go?

This is Dad. Where's your mother?

155
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,110
She went out shopping.
 You're in Hokkaido, aren't you?

156
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah. Did you go to cram school?

157
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,750
I'm about to. Hey, bring back a souvenir.

158
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,010
Oh, yeah.

159
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,800
Katsuo...

160
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,970
Bring back a huge crab!

161
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,640
Be sure to do your homework.

162
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,140
I will! So please bring back a crab!

163
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,110
Uh, okay. I'll see what I can do.

164
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,980
Thanks.

165
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,760
That's right. I have to do something.</i>

166
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,270
Apparently Inokuma-kun didn't make it,</i>

167
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,490
and the negotiations don't seem to be going well either.</i>

168
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,580
But I'll think of something, Katsuo.</i>

169
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,700
A crab, remember? A crab! Dad, are you listening?

170
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,000
I must do it for your sake.</i>
A crab, remember? A crab! Dad, are you listening?

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,010
A crab, remember? A crab! Dad, are you listening?

172
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,560
I'm truly sorry! This is all my fault!

173
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,080
I can't allow myself to get fired!</i>

174
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,970
I have my beloved family to take care of!</i>

My son needs to get into a private middle school!</i>

177
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,320
I confess to everything!

178
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,970
When I said Inokuma-kun couldn't attend the tournament because of her hip,

179
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,950
it was a complete lie!

180
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,830
She's already gone to the National Martial Arts Hall.

181
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,880
Though I made a false promise so your negotiations would go well,

182
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,550
j-judo should come first for her... but...

183
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,880
but it appears she didn't make it to her match.

184
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,560
So if your negotiations don't go well,
 it will all have been in vain!

185
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,570
S-So please, I implore you to not be angry and try to reach a deal.

186
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,030
Huh?

187
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,630
Oh man, let's have lunch.

188
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,070
We'll have some beer first.

189
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
Ten bottles of beer, please!

190
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,580
E-Excuse me?

191
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,580
Mr. Director! That was an excellent chip shot you did at the fifth hole!

192
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,040
Excuse me!

193
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,040
God!

194
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,610
What the hell were you mumbling?

195
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,340
It's embarrassing, so quit it!

196
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,050
O-Oh, I was just apologizing to everyone.

197
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,880
Don't do anything stupid!

198
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm trying to liven up the mood here!

199
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,560
But you do know this is all my fault.

200
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,360
You don't need to tell me that!

201
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,900
Everything was going peachy!

202
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,070
But ever since you sent Inokuma Yawara back with no explanation,

203
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,320
things have gotten real dicey!

204
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,250
So stop flitting about!

205
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,460
I don't need things to get worse!

206
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,500
Is this to your liking, sir?
I don't need things to get worse!

207
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,780
Oh, let me pour that for you!

Hagoromo, or whoever that assistant manager is, made a complete mess in Hokkaido!

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,990
It was a huge mistake to let him handle a client as important as Kato Chu!

219
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,420
Come on. Step on it!

220
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,640
U-Um, where to?

To the Martial Arts Hall, dammit!

222
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,180
If our deal with Kato Chu goes to hell,

223
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,890
and if Inokuma Yawara loses to that Honami girl, it will be a disaster!

224
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,660
S-Say, why don't we watch some TV?

This is the All-Japan Judo Championships,

242
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,100
presented live from Tokyo's Martial Arts Hall.

243
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,590
Here's the commentator you all know and love, Saito-san.

244
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,460
Hi, folks.

245
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,100
I still can't believe what happened here.

246
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,760
Me either.

247
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,530
Let's take a look at the film.

248
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,140
Hey, we can't see!

249
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,220
Take a look at Honami Sayaka's first match.

250
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,720
That was an explosive right Uchi Mata!

251
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,730
Here's her second match.

252
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,510
Her opponent didn't stand a chance against her speed and combination of moves.

253
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,730
It blew my mind.

254
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,490
Honami Sakaya has made a comeback

255
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,460
with her speed and strength, and the beauty of her combination moves.

256
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,990
She won her first three matches and advances to the semifinals.

257
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,250
If only Inokuma-san had entered this match,

258
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,090
we could've seen her battle it out with Honami.

259
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,510
But she hurt her hip, so it wasn't possible.

260
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,180
Then, Saito-san, there's Inokuma.

261
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,040
Here we are at the 8th hole with a tricky shot from the woods.

262
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,170
Ozaki, nice shot!

263
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,020
Hey, don't change the channel!

264
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,440
A nice recovery by Ozaki!

265
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,130
What are you doing? They were saying something about Inokuma!

266
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,740
Probably showing a highlight reel of her or something.

267
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,390
There you have it, a marvelous Ippon Zeoi!

268
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,220
Inokuma-kun...

269
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,050
Then in her second-round match, here's her Ouchi Gari!

270
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,590
But that was a feint, as she goes all in with an Ippon Zeoi!

271
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,410
Gosh, Inokuma-san is really something.

272
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,850
This must be a recording of one of her matches last year.

273
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,190
I've seen that before. It's from last year’s World Championships, right?

274
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,740
No way!

275
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,820
She's facing a Japanese player, so it must be from the All-Japan Selected.

276
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,400
In the third round,

277
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,530
the heavily built Murai and her instep fell victim to Inokuma's Kosoto Gari.

278
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,220
Talk about a stunner.

279
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,600
Wait! Right now Inokuma Yawara's quarterfinal match is about to begin!

280
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,380
R-Right now?

281
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,710
Inokuma-san!

282
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,170

283
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,730
U-Uh, she's not actually competing now, is she?

284
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,120
It's a video! I remember seeing this match.

285
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,810
But they said it's starting right now.

286
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,680
It's just a highlight reel.

287
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,130
Excuse me, more beer, please!

288
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,070
She's facing another large opponent, Uzaki.

289
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,320
This will also be an exciting contest.

290
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,590
We thought Inokuma was going to lose by default for not making it to her first match,

291
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,200
but she arrived in the nick of time.

292

Inokuma-kun...
but she arrived in the nick of time.

293
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,630
However, she's proving again and again that she still has it.

311
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,810
She crushed her!

312
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,720
Inokuma Yawara tossed the heavyweight Uzaki through the air with her Ippon Zeoi!

313
