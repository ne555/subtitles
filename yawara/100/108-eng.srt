00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Deh-heh-heh

2
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,800
I really am a loser.

3
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,740
I lost so quickly in last week's All-Japan Selected.

4
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm still not nearly good enough.

5
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,160
Don't say that! You just fell victim to your opponent's timing.

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,260
But still...

7
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,740
you know how I went like this during that match.

8
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,740
Then I thought I'd go for an Uchi Mata.

9
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,520
Then this happened.


10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,070
No, at that point you were supposed to do this!

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,780
But then I'd end up doing this.

12
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,780
No, you're supposed to do this and this.

13
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
Then this?

14
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,280
No, more like this.

15
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,540
I get it, like this!

16
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,420
Yes, then you do this!

17
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,420
This?

18
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,820
<b>Resolve Among Men!</b>


19
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,260
Two girls talking about judo in a café on a Sunday.

20
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,580
That's kind of... you know.

21
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,580
Yeah.


22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,810
By the way, are you sure you should be here on a Sunday?

23
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,580
What do you mean?

24
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,590
Shouldn't you be seeing Hanazono-kun?

25
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,090
W-Well...

26
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,950
I haven't had a chance to see him for a while.

27
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,560
Since when?

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,420
It was sometime before the All-Japan Judo Championships, so a little over two months.

29
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,810
That long?

30
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,780
But you two talk on the phone, right?



31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
He usually doesn't answer when I try calling him.

32
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,570
He's training very hard for his upcoming match.

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,700
Even if he's in training, he should have time to talk to you at night.

34
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,580
It looks like he's so worn out by then
 that he's already asleep.


35
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,600
Wait.

36
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,700
He didn't come to the Judo Championships or last week's Selected to cheer for you, did he?

37
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,050
Still, even if he does have an upcoming match...

38
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,300
I know.

39
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,760
It's making me start wondering about things.

40
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,560
Like what?

41
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,830
That he might be seeing someone else.

42
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,780
Hanazono-san's so sweet and handsome.


43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,220
I don't think other women will ignore him.

44
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,080
He's that handsome.

45
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,040
Y-You're right.

46
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,000
Even a responsible man like him might give in if girls pursued him aggressively.

47
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,820
You're right. You can never tell with a guy.

48
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,010
You think so too, Inokuma-san?

49
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,540
I know so!



50
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,520
They'll talk a sweet game while doing God-knows-what behind your back.

51
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,210
This is food for dinner, and these are the toiletries I always bring for the night!

52
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,200
I swear to God!

53
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,040
Inokuma-san, what happened?



54
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,960
Nothing happened.

55
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,250
By the way, Inokuma-san, how are things going with Matsuda-san?

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,010
Th-There's absolutely nothing going on between me and Matsuda-san!

57
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,400
There you go again.

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,020
Who was looking oh-so-lonely without Matsuda-san in Yugoslavia?

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,560
I-It's really not what you think.

60
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,570
Actually, you two seemed kind of distant at last week's All-Japan Selected.

61
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,300
I thought we were talking about Hanazono-kun!



62
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,530
U-Uh, right.

63
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:57,540
Honest to God, why is Hanazono-kun shutting you out so completely?

64
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:57,550
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,320
H-Hanazono-san? Ito Fujiko hit a snag the other day!

68
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,520
Can't you at least meet her on Sunday and cheer her up?

69
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,060
Zip it! We've got 30 more laps left!

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,070
This kind of outdoor training is embarrassing!

71
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,570
Okay, leave everything to me.

72
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,750
I'll go see Hanazono-kun.

73
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,370
Y-You don't have to do that, Inokuma-san!

74
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,800
I have to. This can't go on!


75
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,450
No, it ends here.

76
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,300
B-But... Inokuma-san!

77
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,760
Hanazono-kun...

78
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,180
have a seat.

79
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,810
I-I'm already sitting.

80
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,270
You know why I called you here, right?

81
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,190
Uh, well...

82
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,160
Hanazono-kun! What have you been up to lately?

83
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,790
I have no honor!

84
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,670
So... So it <i>is</i> true.

85
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,210
Do you have any idea what you're putting Fujiko-san through?

86
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,620
I have nothing to say for myself.

87
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,180
You shouldn't apologize to me!

88
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,860
God, there's no telling what guys will do if you leave them to their own devices.

89
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,810
This is food for dinner, and these are the toiletries I always bring for the night!

90
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,000
I swear, they're pigs!

91
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,960
O-Oh, it's nothing.

92
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,250
Anyway, go see Fujiko-san!

93
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,470
N-No!

94
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,720
I-I can't do that.

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,350
Why not?

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,980
I can't meet with Fujiko-san right now.

97
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,480
But you need to see her and apologize.

You're despicable! Fujiko-san has been so good to you.

104
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,350
Only a total bum would be unfaithful to her!

105

I'm sorry.

106
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,400
But I've made my choice.

107

Over Fujiko-san?

Good for you. I hope it works out.

110
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,370
Yes, I really need it to work out!

111
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,790
I'm already a junior. This is my last chance...

112
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,080
to be a starter!

113
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,130
In order to move forward, I have to get a starting position!

114

I have to give it all I've got!

115
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,300
Hang in there, Hanazono Kaoru!

116
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,100
U-Um... are you seeing someone else?

117
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,720
Yes, Fujiko-san is a magnificent woman!

118
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,240
On the other hand... compared to her...

119
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,510
I'm an utter disappointment!

120
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,160
Um...

121
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,220
Inokuma!

122
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,080
Yes?

123
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,080
You and Fujiko-san are amazing.

124
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,670
The All-Japan, the World Championships, and now the upcoming Barcelona Olympics...

125
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,140
But I'm not even a starter on a no-name Ebitendo judo team.

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,890
Hanazono-kun?

127

I want to see her. I want to see her badly.

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,110
B-But I've made my decision.

129
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,870
I <i>will</i> become better! And until I do, I won't see her!

She's late!

132
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,060
That idiot office girl!

133
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,790
Did she stop for a swing-ding at a "desco" on her way back from work?

134
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,430
Honestly!

135
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,220
Thanks for dropping me off.

I can help you through this, along with Fujiko-san.

P-Please, don't tell Fujiko-san.

I swear you can relax. Everything is all right.

179
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,280
R-Really? Then I guess I should call him.

180
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,760
Uh...

181
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,680
I don't think he's going to pick up even if you call him.

182
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,760
Anyway, we'll meet next weekend!

183
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,530
Okay, sure. I'll see you.

184
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,750
Something's not right.

185
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,160
C'mon! C'mon! Quicken that instep of yours!

186
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,160
Please listen, Grandpa. I have a favor to ask!

187
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,170
Sure, I'll do anything you want, as long as you get the gold in Barcelona!

188
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,540
That's not what I meant!

189
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,510
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

190
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,970
If it's about love, I've already got a solution for ya.

191
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,470
What are you talking about?

192
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,230
Just concentrate only on judo. C'mon, let's practice.

193
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,630
Huh? What are you getting at?

194
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,330
What? Ain't gonna happen! It ain't happening on my watch!

195
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,340
Please, I beg you, just this once! Master!

196
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,790
I'm also begging you, Grandpa!

197
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,080
Forget it! Yawara ain't commingling with no men!

198
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,830
She ain't allowed near one till after the Barcelona Olympics!

199
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,100
Oh God... just a little more!

200
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,960
There's no beating the Celebrity Swim Meet!

201
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,410
Hi, you've reached the Ebitendo College Judo Club Dorms!

202
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,640
Huh? Hanazono-san?

203
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,580
Sorry, Hanazono-san is out right now.

204
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,440
Oh, is that so?

205
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,320
I'll try again la—

206
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,900
Hey, gimme that phone! Come on, give it up!

207
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,330
No, it's mine!
Hey, gimme that phone! Come on, give it up!

208
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,880
Hello, you're speaking with Masuta now.

209
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,120
We apologize for all the trouble Hanazono has caused you.

210
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,840
Quit sounding like someone you're not!

211
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,320
N-No need. I'll just try again some other time.

212
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,010
Oh, I would like to use this opportunity to offer some advice.

213
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,780
This is for your own good. You shouldn't associate with Hanazono.

214
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,520
Right now, he's busy with another girl!

215
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,110
We have no idea how many girls he's brought to tears!

216
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,370
Just today, a girl's grandfather came here warning him to stay away from her!







217
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,800
We have other club members who are much finer specimens than Hanazono.

218
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,840
For example, there's me, Masuta.

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,770
Hey, you don't get to have her first!

220
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,590
Don't forget me, Ozaki!

221
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:34,590
Hello?

222
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,510
This is Ueda! Nice to...

223
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,520
Hanazono, you mean to say

224
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,400
you're not pleading for permission to marry Yawara after violating her against her will?

225
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,740
Wh-What are you saying?

226
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,720
What kind of nonsense is this?

227
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,750
I already told you I wanted to help Hanazono-kun practice!

228
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,260
The fall tournament is Hanazono-kun's last chance as a college student.

229
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:21,710
He's sworn he won't see Fujiko-san unless he makes a good showing.

230
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,280
Great!






231
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,530
I thought you were just a good-for-nothing, blockheaded apeman.

232
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,780
But you proved me wrong, Hanazono!

233
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,090
A-Aw shucks, it's not that big a deal.

234
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,700
You're focusing on judo while abstaining from romantic affairs.

235
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,750
I'm real proud of you, Hanazono!

236
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,160
Um, no...

237
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm just ashamed to see her until I get better. That's all.

238
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,370
I only wish a certain googly-eyed office girl who forgets her judo would take that to heart.

239
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,990
So are you going to help Hanazono-kun practice, Grandpa?

240
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,980
I beg you, Master!

241
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,280
I'm begging you too!

242
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,410
Still...

243
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,410
Still?




244
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,810
It's still a fact that I'm way over the hill.

245
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,100
I think it'd be a wee bit hard on these old bones

246
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,230
if I personally took on a hulking behemoth like Hanazono.

247
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,260
Master!

248
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,730
Grandpa...

249
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,890
I'm painfully moved by your spirit, Hanazono.

250
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:03,200
If only I were able to personally teach you my strong, strong judo, I would!

251
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,780
I'm aching to be your practice partner, but I just can't!

252
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,610
I'll do it!





253
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,660
I'll be Hanazono-kun's practice partner!

254
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
I'll train as hard as he does!

255
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,590
Inokuma!

256
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,280
Oh? So you're gonna train hard?

257
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,920
Just so you know, your pantywaist practicing these days ain't gonna make anyone stronger.

258
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,850
I'll do it!


259
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,080
I know I'm asking for the moon.

260
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,700
But please, just this once, Master!

261
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,360
Please, Grandpa!

262
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,580
My training can be a mite tough.

She probably thinks Kaga-kun and I are practically living together!</i>

267
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,860
But how am I supposed to explain myself?

268
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,100
Now that I think about it, I mean nothing to Yawara-san.

269
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,830
She probably wouldn't give a damn if it <i>was</i> just a misunderstanding.

W-Wait, are you kidding me?

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,590
That old man hardly ever teaches anyone judo!

276
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,360
Yes, I don't deserve it.

277
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,520
But the fall tournament is my last shot.

278
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,610
I see. This will make for a great scoop—

279
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,740
You can't do that!

280
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,640
What?

281
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,330
S-Sorry. But please refrain from doing that.

282
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,330
I-If you write a story, Fujiko-san will find out.

283
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,750
Huh? Fujiko-san doesn't know about this?

284
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,760
With the effort you're putting in,
 Fujiko-san will fall in love all over again!

285
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,720
That won't sit well with me.

286
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,310
It'll mean nothing if she sees me training hard.

You either win... or you lose.

I'm not training nearly hard enough.

290
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,280
Will a disappointment like me ever be good enough for Fujiko-san?
