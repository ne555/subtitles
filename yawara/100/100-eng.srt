00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,900
Hagoromo-kun! Why are you just standing around?

2
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,700
Assistant Manager Hagoromo!

3
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,040
Oh, Mr. Branch Manager.

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,170
Don't give me that! Did you send Inokuma Yawara home?


5
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,960
Yes, sir, right on schedule.

6
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,210
Right on schedule? You're supposed to send her home earlier!

7
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,390
Listen, you don't have to give her any work!

8
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,860
The higher-ups said to let her concentrate on judo!

9
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,390
U-Understood.

10
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Geez! It's not like you do any work around here yourself!

11
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,150
Mr. Hagoromo, I've made the reservations!

12
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,650
I've made the reservations.

13
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,900
I-I see. So you've made the reservations.

14
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,780
Now here's something you don't see every day.

15
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,490
So Hagoromo-kun got himself a reservation? Probably nothing worth mentioning.

16
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,210
Kato Chu, huh?

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,970
K-Kato Chu Company?!

18
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,690
Hokkaido and the Martial Arts Hall

19
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,630
Let's give a hand to Assistant Manager Hagoromo!

20
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,730
Look, now wait.

21
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,760
I thought you just sat around and read the sports papers.

22
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,150
I can't believe you landed a deal with Kato Chu Company.




23
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,760
Like they say, a good hawk hides its claws.

24
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,370
R-Right.

25
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,290
So it's scheduled from April 21st to the 23rd, eh?

26
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:22,400
If we make that three-day outing a success, Kato Chu will become our loyal customer.

27
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,550
Y-Yeah.



28
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,020
A major corporation like Kato Chu will be a huge boost for our firm!

29
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,250
It will also be a major blow to their former exclusive travel firm, Honami Travel.

30
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,410
Inokuma-san needs to be there with us!

31
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,950
U-Uh, excuse me...

Mm-hmm.

36
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,040
Work's been very hard.


37
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
I attract a lot of attention because I'm just starting out.

38
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,460
Huh?

39
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,350
"Work's been very hard"!

40
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,490
If Beanpole can't set her straight, then I'm taking matters into my own hands!

41
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,860
That idiot office girl!

42
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,310
You're too loud!

43
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,370
Pipe down and eat your fruit parfait!



44
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,620
But one thing at work did go well!

45
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,810
It was so exhilarating!

46
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,870
So is it...

47
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,130
the same feeling you get when you score an Ippon with an Ippon Zeoi?

48
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,830
That's slick, Beanpole.

49
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,260
That's my fruit parfait!

50
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,760
Cut it out, Fujiko-san! Work is nothing like judo.

51
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,870
Y-You're right.

52
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,440
You have no delicacy!

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,980
Don't interfere!

54
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,020
Uh, um...

55
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,730
Actually, Inokuma-san...

56
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,640
You must also be working hard at Saikai University every day.

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,360
Let's both go all out at the All-Japan Championships.

58
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,620
Bo...

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,660
"Both"? Inokuma-san, are you going to enter?

60
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,330
I have to! You're entering too!

61
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,720
Thank you, Inokuma-san!




62
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,030
I felt so helpless and alone!

63
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,010
Fujiko-san!

64
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,970
I didn't know what I'd do if you didn't enter!

Fujiko-san...

66
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,880

Kato Chu is Honami Travel's biggest account!</i>

175
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,530
Um...

176
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,820
That's a very complicated problem!

177
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,360
Let me think it over <i>very</i> carefully!

178
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,450
Okay.




179
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,450
Kazamatsuri-san is really thinking about me seriously.</i>

180
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,130
Compose yourself. Think about this logically.</i>

181
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,800
If Yawara-san enters the tournament...</i>

182
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,380
Sign: President's Office#
If Yawara-san enters the tournament...</i>

183
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,550
Sign: President's Office#

184
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,960
Honami Travel won't lose a big account, and I, the president...</i>

185
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Hell, yeah!

186
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,480
But if Yawara-san faces the new superpowered Sayaka-san...</i>

187
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,990
and she loses...</i>

188
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,410
my company will be safe, but at the cost of my bachelorhood.</i>

189
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,120
But if Yawara-san spurns the match and succeeds on her company outing,</i>

190
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,170
Honami Travel will suffer a huge blow,</i>

191
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,100
and I, the company president, will be in big trouble.</i>

192
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,880
But if she doesn't enter the tournament,</i>

193
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,600
Sayaka-san won't get her match with Yawara-san.</i>

194
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,460
Sign: So you ran away, Inokuma Yawara!#
Sayaka-san won't get her match with Yawara-san.</i>

195
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,480
Sign: So you ran away, Inokuma Yawara!#

196
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,650
Which means...</i>

197
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,610
my marriage with Sayaka-san will be put on indefinite hold,</i>

198
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,310
and I'll be free as a bird!</i>

199
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,620
But...</i>

200
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,830
Um, I'm really sorry...

201
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,830
for coming to you with this problem.

202
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,300
Don't be!

203
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,590
L-Let me make a call.

204
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,100
That's right, Kato Chu Company.

205
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,100
I want to know how much business we get from them per year.

206
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes, just give me a rough estimate.

207
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,540
Are you okay, Kazamatsuri-san?

208
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,310
You look pale.

209
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,540
Twenty... Twenty billion...

210
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,880
Huh?





211
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,550
Twenty billion yen.

212
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,670
I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.

213
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,520
I guess I need to make the decision myself.

214
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,520
Th-That's...

215
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,530
That's...

216
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,030
Who cares about twenty billion yen or Honami Travel?</i>

217
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,490
My... My happiness, my freedom...</i>

218
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,290
Y-Yawara-san!

219
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,710
You have to remember that your job comes first!

220
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,380
A life with just judo is not a life worth living!

221
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,500
A woman's path in the world starts in the workplace!

222
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,260
Who cares about the All-Japan Championships?!

223
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,070
Take that trip to Hokkaido!

224
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,720
And make sure you show them a good time!

225
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,020
Okay!

226
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,050
Still, marrying Sayaka-san would guarantee me a good life.</i>

227
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,130
Are you willing to throw all of that away, Shinnosuke?</i>



228
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,420
But I still have Fujiko-san.</i>

229
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,060
Next!

230
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,990
The more I observe, the more fearsome she looks.</i>

231
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,900
Yawara-san, your father made her into a true rival!</i>

232
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,030
Next!

233
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,370
I made the right decision.</i>

234
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,110
If I married Sayaka-san as soon as she defeated Yawara-san...</i>

235
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,820
You gotta be kidding!</i>

236
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,790
I-I'm really glad she's going on that corporate trip.




237
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,050
I-Is that really Honami Sayaka?!

238
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,640
Sh-She's like a whole 'nother person!

239
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,090
I can't believe she's become that good!

240
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,840
You won't come out of this one unscathed, Yawara-san!

241
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,120
In just a little while...

242
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,200
In just a little while, I will end our feud.

243
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,070
Wash your neck and prepare for your hanging, Inokuma Yawara!

244
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,070
What will I do? There's only one week left.</i>

245
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,410
What should I say?</i>

246
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,120
If I tell Fujiko-san now that I can't enter the tournament...</i>

247
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,700
But I promised her we'd enter together.</i>

248
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,940
Inokuma-kun!
But I promised her we'd enter together.</i>

249
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,080
Inokuma-kun?

250
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,390
Inokuma-kun!

251
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,090
Yes?

252
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,840
Just so you know, we'll be having dinner on the 21st when we arrive.

253
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,260
Of course!

254
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,530
So... we'll be reserving a table at the Restaurant Nociété Ailes? 

255
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,930
I'll call them right away!

256
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,760
See? We may be discussing her assignment,</i>

257
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,700
but her heart's at the All Japan Championships.</i>

258
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,400
Even today's All Sports News is buzzing with reports that her rival, Honami Sayaka,</i>

259
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,560

Even today's All Sports News is buzzing with reports that her rival, Honami Sayaka,</i>

Headline: Honami Sayaka's Transformation#

262
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,460
It's over.</i>

263
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,950
There's no point in discussing this assignment.</i>

264
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:12,460
Still, couldn't she say she can't go on this trip because of the tournament?</i>

265
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,460
That way I can give up and move on.</i>

266
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,490
And there's also the dinner the next night on the 22nd.

267
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,590
L-Look, Inokuma-kun.

268
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,090
Yes, sir?

269
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Uh, well...

270
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,830
H-How are you feeling?

271
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,930
Oh, very well!

272
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,690
I'll do my best next weekend.

273
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,690
Uh, yeah. I know you will.

274
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,410
So she is entering the tournament.</i>

275
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,280
Does she have any idea how big this assignment is?</i>

276
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,010
O-Or how it could change my life?</i>

277
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm exhausted.

278
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,140
But the tournament is just around the corner. I have to work hard!

279
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,140
The All Japan Championships are just two days away!

280
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,970
Mm-hmm.

281
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,940
I was nervous at the beginning, but now I'm brimming with courage!

282
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,440
R-Right.

283
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm sure it's because we'll be together!

284
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,870
What's wrong, Inokuma-san?

285
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,120
Fujiko-san, the truth is I...

286
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,420
Honey, what would you say if, for example...

287
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,520
If I got fired, what would you do?

288
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,180
What?

289
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,440
So you did mess up in some way!

290
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,440
I thought it was strange that you finally got a big assignment!

291
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,900
N-No, I didn't.




292
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,650
If you're starting to get any big ideas, then you'd better just sit tight and do nothing!

293
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,720
We need money for a down payment on a house!

294
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,160
Katsuo needs to go to a private middle school in order to get into a good university!

295
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,170
D-Don't worry! I was just asking "what if."

296
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,690
Don't joke around! Honestly!

297
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,820
A good university, huh?

298
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,480
Hey, food.

299
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,160
There is no food.

300
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,540
So you say.

302
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,620

She's going to the All Japan Championships tomorrow.

304
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:06,550
Kato Chu Company and their guests are coming soon, expecting to see Inokuma Yawara.

305
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,440
Then my lie will be exposed.

306
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,600
It will all be over.

307
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,270
Will they fire me?

308
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,340
I'm sorry for being late!

309
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,070
They'll definitely fire me.

310
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,200
My life will continue to be one long losing streak.

311
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,260

312
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,870

Where'd that screwy little bubblehead go?!

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,270
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san, I have to...

317
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,860
H-Hokkaido?!

318
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm taking you back! Right now, on the double!

319
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,010
I'm grabbing you by the scruff of your neck and taking you back!

320
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,340
A-Assistant Manager Hagoromo, what did you just say?

321
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,250
Yawara!
