1
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,540
Yuko!

2
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,570
Jougai! Mate!

3
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,540
Honami hangs on!

4
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,660
I can't believe she withstood that Ippon Zeoi!

5
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,500
Inokuma's short of breath!

6
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,640
She can't hide her shock at the way Honami's speed is running her ragged!

7
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,640
On the other hand, Honami is wearing an audacious smirk!

8
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,600
Hajime!

9
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,000
So what are you going to do now?</i>

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,320
Your trademark move only earned you a Yuko.</i>

11
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,500
If you don't hurry, I'll score an Ippon against you...</i>

12
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,410
with my secret weapon!</i>

13
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,580
<b>The Heiress' Secret Weapon</b>

14
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,600
It's the semifinal match of the All-Japan Women's Judo Championships,

15
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,300
Inokuma versus Honami!

16
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,140
Honami suffered a Yuko against Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi,

17
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,850
but Honami is still smiling triumphantly!

18
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,810
Yawara-san looks really serious!

19
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,090
We need her to be serious!

20
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,360
Sayaka-san has some sort of secret weapon!




21
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,950
Hang in there, Inokuma-san!

22
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,110
You can do it!

23
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,110
It's Honami with another Uchi Mata!

24
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,620
Inokuma blocks her by squeezing her leg!

25
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,580
Jougai! Mate!

26
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,300
That lousy moron!

27
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,580
Taking her sweet time just because her opponent has become a little tougher!

28
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,830
Lose already! Lose and quit that office girl job of yours!

29
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,090
Then we can start all over again at Saikai U!

30
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,750
Inokuma Yawara.</i>



31
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,810
You have yet to see what's in store.</i>

32
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,620
I mastered something right at the end of my ten month seclusion on that mountain.</i>

33
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,030
The secret weapon that will slay you!</i>

34
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,690
I'm thoroughly annoyed!

35
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,300
Why do you think a well-bred lady like me would stay deep in the mountains, covered in sweat?!

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,890
Sign: Inokuma Yawara
Ugly Moron#

37
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,300
It's you! It's all your fault, Inokuma Yawara!
Sign: Inokuma Yawara
Ugly Moron#

38
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,060
Hey, are you done splitting wood and fetching water?

39
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,830
I've just about had it with those chores!

40
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,560
You've kept me on this mountain for months, yet you're not teaching me anything!

41
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,280
Chop the firewood, get the water, make the bath.

42
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,740
I've had enough of that!

43
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,810
That dummy's useless because you ripped its sleeve!

44
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,530
Now make my bath.

45
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,330
It still has its left sleeve!




46
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,670
You're totally annoying!

47
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,920
I'm using you as firewood for the bath!

48
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,030
No need for a bath.

49
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,430
Do what you did again.

50
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,270
That was when I discovered it.</i>

51
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,440
The secret weapon that will destroy you.</i>

52
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,450
Hajime!

53
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,950
Honami's on the attack!

54
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,400
Inokuma still leads by a Yuko,

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,750
but she's losing ground against Honami's unusual drive!

56
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,090
Oh! Honami tries a Kosoto Gari!

57
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,590
Inokuma loses her balance!

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,640
Hang in there, Inokuma-kun!

59
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,590
Don't lose, Inokuma-kun!

60
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,030
What gives? Inokuma-san's up on points, but it sure doesn't look like it.

61
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,100
Y-Yeah.

62
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,570
It's all your fault!

63
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,580
She had an important match coming up,

64
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,850
yet you brought her here because you wanted to look good to your bosses!

65
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,610
That's right! I'm entirely at fault!

66
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,570
Wh-What? Now you're defiant?!

67
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,240
However! She won't lose just because she went on some company trip!

68
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,080
Inokuma-kun's judo would never lose because of that!

69
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,010
No way! Inokuma-san's not going to lose!

70
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,880
M-Mr. Director.

71
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,000
Enough of your prattle.
 Cheer her on, you numskull!

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,870
O-Okay!

73
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,090
Yes, get her now!

74
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,830
Go, Inokuma-kun!

75
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,850
Throw her down!

76
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,350
Inokuma's Ouchi Gari!

77
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,350
Nope, it's now a Seoi!

78
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,600
But Honami shakes it off!

79
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,700
Inokuma's back to her normal speed!

80
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,950
Wait. Perhaps Honami triggered it,
 but Inokuma's moving faster than ever!

81
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,910
But Honami easily matches her speed!

82
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,200
And she's still beaming!

83
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,160
It's a one second chance, Miss.

84
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,830
Don't let that chance slip away.


85
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,700
This match has turned epic!

86
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,180
Still, when will Sayaka-san use her secret weapon?!

87
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,970
It's just about time!</i>

88
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,120
What's going on, Master?

89
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,930
Hasn't she noticed that the heiress is gripping her differently?

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,170
Come and attack me, Inokuma Yawara!</i>

91
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,190
Use your trademark move!</i>

92
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,520
Use your Ippon Zeoi!</i>

93
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,320
Inokuma-san, please hang in there!

94
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,910
We'll play each other in the final match!

95
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,640
Fujiko-san.</i>



96
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,050
Inokuma's Kosoto Gari puts Honami off balance!

97
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,010
She's now going for an Ippon Zeoi!

98
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,590
Now!</i>

99
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,420
Now's the time!</i>

100
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,250
Honami moves in from the left!
 Inokuma's completely defenseless!

101
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,640
I've got you!

102
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,720
You have a golden glow coming from your left.

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,310
It's your Golden Left!

104
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,360
The Golden Left? That name fits me perfectly!

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,820
Here's my Golden Left!

106
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,320
Honami goes for a left Uchi Mata!

107
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,940
Is that her secret weapon?!

108
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,830
Her nuclear weapon!
Is that her secret weapon?!

109
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,290
Lose already!

110
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,790
Inokuma Yawara, prepare to lose!

111
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,830
That can work!</i>

112
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,990
Ippon! Done!

113
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,480
Inokuma with a Seoi Otoshi Ippon!

114
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:34,140
Honami's surprise left Uchi Mata failed spectacularly against Inokuma!

115
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,640
Sh-She did it!

116
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,450
That was cool!

117
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,960
Sh-She won.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,710
She won!

119
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,350
She won! She won! Yawara-san won!

120
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,460
Why are you celebrating?
 Aren't you Sayaka's coach?

121
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,770
Master, Yawara-san really did it! That was truly amazing!

122
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,610
You and your simpleminded jubilation!

123
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,660
Don't you know your big catch just got away?

124
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,160
If she'd lost, she would've joined your judo team for some serious retraining!

125
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,440
Now that she's won so spectacularly,
 we have nothing to hold over her head!





126
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
She got her good!

127
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,930
She got that snotty Honami brat right in front of our signboard!

128
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,840
I regret nothing!

129
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,200
I don't care about the fiasco with Kato Chu in Hokkaido!

130
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,460
Once we fire that Hagoromo guy, we can put that behind us!

131
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,530
It wasn't for nothing. I'm not getting fired for nothing.

132
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,790
That was beautiful, Mr. Tsurukame.

133
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,720
You ain't seen nothing, sir!

134
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,730
I didn't think she would win! She <i>was</i> here in Hokkaido just this morning.

135
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,790
I knew she would win.




136
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,610
That's our managing director of Toyosan!

137
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,210
Still, Honami put up a splendid fight.

138
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,440
She was evenly matched with Inokuma the entire time!

139
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,360
Bow!

140
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,230
Sayaka-san!

141
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,710
That was an amazing Uchi Mata.
 If I hadn't made that quick sweep...

142
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,480
Also... you lost your false tooth again.

143
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,590
Inokuma is extending her hand to Honami for her solid performance.

144
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,090
Oh, my! Honami slapped away Inokuma's hand!

145
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,520
It's clear Honami still maintains her enmity against her!



146
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,200
We'll probably see another grudge match between them in the future!

147
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,960
There you go! Come back as many times as you want!

148
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,030
You're the only one who can light a fire under her butt!

149
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,160
Yawara-san would've joined us if she'd lost?

150
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,210
Honami-san! Were you planning that surprise attack from the start?

151
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,880
Will you fight her again?

152
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,550
What will you do, Honami-san?

153
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,570
Milady...

154
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,530
Yokunaga.

155
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,200
Yes?

156
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,450
We're roing roo ruh rentist.

157
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,950
We're going roo the dentist!

158
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,040
Milady... oh, good heavens!

159
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,490
Saito-san, that was a stunning match!

160
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,020
"Stunning" doesn't begin to describe it! Inokuma was simply off the charts!

161
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,670
Oh, Saito-san, we have a video replay.

162
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,670
This is where it begins. Take a good look.

163
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,650
Honami changed her grip.

164
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,080
Yes, you're right.

165
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,180
She placed both hands close to Inokuma's armpits.

166
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,450
Honami was already preparing for her surprise attack.

167
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,520
That way, she opened herself to an attack from either side.

168
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
I see.

169
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,950
Oh, next came Inokuma's Kosoto Gari.

170
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,650
She made Honami lose her balance and then got into position for an Ippon Zeoi.

171
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,550
But right at that moment,
 Honami switched to her left.

172
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,890
She changed her grip at the beginning in anticipation for this chance, huh?

173
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,660
That's right.

174
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,420
Honami then attempted a perfectly timed left Uchi Mata.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,230
If she'd been facing a normal opponent, that would've given her an Ippon.








176
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,670
However, Inokuma displayed her inborn instincts.

177
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,250
Take a look here.

178
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,990
Inokuma was supposed to be at Honami's mercy, but she was actually evading the Uchi Mata.

179
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,470
Her body reacted before she could think.

180
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,930
She then grabbed Honami's right collar in the blink of an eye.

181
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,060
She's sure practiced a lot.

182
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,200
Nobody could perfect this through just practice.

183
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,100
In addition, her right foot shot toward Honami's pivot foot.

184
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,660
Then came her Seoi.

185
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,200
Once again, absolutely amazing!

186
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,620
Yeah.





187
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,390
Tell me. Just how good are you?

188
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,180
Yawara.

189
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,440
Sir, can I watch my horse races?

190
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,630
More.

191
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,760
This time I'll have a large helping of oyako donburi.

192
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,800
Fine.

193
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,430
The National Martial Arts Hall is settling down after the Inokuma vs. Honami match!

194
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,770
We're finally moving on to the B Block semifinal match!

195
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:12,820
One! Two! Three! Four! 

196
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,700
Hey, Hanazono, aren't you watching?
One! Two! Three! Four! 

197
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,160
Watching what?

198
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,180
The women's judo tournament on TV!

199
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,170
Your girlfriend, Ito Fujiko, has made it to the semis!

200
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,390
The semifinals?

201
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,260
That's just great! Let's take a break.

202
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,000
I didn't say we could take a break!

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
But the TV...

204
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,430
Cheering at the TV won't change anything!

205
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,820
Give it your best, Fujiko-san!</i>

206
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,440
Right now, right now, I'm also...</i>

207
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,400
We will now begin our second semifinal match!

208
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,500
Fight hard, Fujiko-san!

209
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,910
Just one more and you're playing Inokuma-chan in the final round!

210
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,710
All right!

211
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,460
Here's our promising player, Ito Fujiko!

212
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,480
She's made great strides with each match she's been in!

213
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,840
She's now entering the ring, ready to fight!

214
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,530
Fujiko-san, avoid her Newaza!

215
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,800
Get her with your Swan Lake or Nutcracker!

216
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,250
Mm-hmm, got it!

217
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,810
Wait for me, Inokuma-san.
 I'll definitely make it to the final match!

218
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,820
And here's the fearsome heavy tank, Tohdoh Yuki!

219
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,160
The veteran Tohdoh, who has gotten even bigger,

220
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,220
won every one of her matches with crushing victories!

221
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,870
T-Todo-san?

222
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,850
I'm sick of seeing you, Beanpole!



223
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,910
Quit getting in the way of my fated showdown!

224
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,340
My only opponent is her, Inokuma Yawara!

225
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,720
Th-That's right, Fujiko.</i>

226
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,470
I came all the way here in order to fight Inokuma-san in the final!</i>

227
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,970
This is no time to be scared!</i>



228
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,260
Now it's time for a match between a veteran and a freshman player!

229
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,900
Will the one fighting Inokuma in the final be Tohdoh?

230
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,320
Or will it be Ito?

231
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,570
Hajime!

232
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,200
Wait for me, Inokuma-san!</i>

233
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,870
Th-That beanstalk, she's gotten way better since the last time!</i>

234
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,880
Un! Deux! Trois!

235
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,840
Yuko!

236
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
All right, Fujiko-san!

237
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,340
Moron, that ain't gonna do it!




238
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,350
Thanks for saving me the trouble!

239
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,710
Whoa! Tohdoh Yuki is going for a Newaza!

240
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,400
Fujiko-san, wrap your legs around hers! Don't let her flip you over!

241
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,380
This is what happens when you don't score an Ippon with that Ouchi Gari!

242
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,130
If you don't score an Ippon, they'll score an Ippon on you!

243
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,370
I keep telling you that, you imbecile!

244
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,660
I'm not going to lose!</i>

245
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,870
Inokuma-san is waiting for me in the final match!</i>

246
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,130
I'm not going to lose!</i>

247
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,090
I'm not going to lose!</i>

248
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,930
Jougai! Mate!

249
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,660
That was close!

250
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,390
If Tohdoh can use her body to pin Fujiko-san, it's over!

251
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,890
That was scary!

252
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,350
Fujiko-san, get it together!

253
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,730
Sh-She's right. I need to focus! I'm almost there!</i>

254
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,780
Once I win this match, I'll be playing Inokuma-san in the final!</i>





255
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,250
Good, this match is mine!

256
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,940
Ito leads by a Yuko!

257
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,080
The veteran Tohdoh may have lost the initiative. What do you think, Saito-san?

258
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,160
Indeed, Ito may have the lead,

259
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,720
but if she gets pinned like that again, she'll be at a complete disadvantage.

260
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,010
Hajime!

261
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,560
What intensity from both players!

262
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,520
It's a battle between fighting spirits!

263
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,380
She's letting her feelings get the best of her!

264
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,300
Beanpole's got her beat on technique,

265
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,490
but she's completely forgotten her positioning.

266
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,040
On the other hand, Fattie's getting into the right position!

267
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,000
Fujiko-san, watch out! Tohdoh-san's planning something!

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
Inokuma-san, wait for me!

269
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,220
Ito's Ouchi Gari!

270
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,840
Tohdoh grabs her leg!

271
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,350
Koka!

272
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,680
Fujiko-san, get away!

273
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,190
Stop!

274
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,220
Crap!

275
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,440
She'll win this one!




276
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,950
Tohdoh goes for another Newaza. Ito Fujiko's in trouble!

277
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,700
Wrap your legs around hers!

278
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,760
Osaekomi!

279
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,500
Tohdoh pins her down tightly with a Yoko Shihoh Gatame!

280
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,120
Dammit!

281
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,800
It appears Yawara-san will be facing Tohdoh in the final match!




282
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,190
Ito struggles for dear life, but Tohdoh won't budge!

283
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,350
Stick a fork in her.

284
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,230
It all comes down to experience.

285
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,700
No, that's not all to Ito's strength!

286
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,780
You'd know that if you read Matsuda's articles in <i>All Sports News !</i>

287
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,120
Come on, Ito!



288
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,030
You came this far to play Inokuma-san in the final round!

289
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,540
It's now fifteen seconds into the Osaekomi!

290
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,500
Is this how Ito Fujiko's going to lose?

291
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,510
I-I can't!

292
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,600
Fujiko-san, don't give up!

293
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Don't give up!

294
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,060
I-I'm sorry, Inokuma-san!</i>

295
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,310
I wanted to play you in the final.</i>

296
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,110
But... I'm finished!</i>

297
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,110
You can do it, Fujiko-san!</i>

298
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,700
Give it... Give it your best, Fujiko-san!</i>

299
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,230
I know you can do it!</i>

300
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,420
Come on! Give it all you've got!</i>

301
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,430
Hanazono-san?</i>

302
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,400
That's right. Hanazono-san is working hard.</i>

303
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,130
So I have to do my best too!</i>

304
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,100
Hanazono-san! I'm going for it!</i>

305
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,770
Good, keep it up! Make a bigger bridge and roll out!

306
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,270
25 seconds in!

307
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,780
It's now a Waza Ari! But Ito desperately makes a bridge!

308
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,790
She breaks out of the Osaekomi at a perilous 28 seconds!

309
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,790
Yay! All right!

310
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,070
Wow!

311
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,790
What fearsome tenacity!






312
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,790
Fujiko-san!

313
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,240
Although it cost her a Waza Ari, she did well breaking out!

314
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm going for it, Hanazono-san.</i>

315
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,180
Inokuma-san, I'll definitely make it to the final round!</i>

316
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,220
There are less than 30 seconds left!

317
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,630
Is Tohdoh's victory all but assured?

318
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,110
I've won!

319
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,800
Can Ito possibly make up for that Waza Ari in such a short time?

320
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,900
This is her critical moment!

321
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,210
I'm not going to lose! Wait for me, Inokuma-san! Wait for me!</i>

322
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,580
Hajime!

323
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,050
Go! There's no time!

324
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,840
Her opponent's not letting her grab anything!

325
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,840
Don't panic! Focus on grabbing her back collar!

326
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,550
Back collar!

327
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,680
Give me that collar!

328
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Collar!

329
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,190
Collar!

330
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,170
She grabbed a good spot!

331
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,740
But...

332
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,360
Let me go to the final round!

333
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,870
Ito forces an Uchi Mata!

334
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,620
Forget it! You ain't getting nothing with that stance!

335
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,620
You have no choice! Do it with everything you've got, Fujiko-san!

336
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,580
Tohdoh resists! Only a few seconds left!

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,420
Please, let me go to the final round!</i>

338
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,970
Let me go to the final round where Inokuma-san is waiting!</i>

339
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:59,930
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 89 Days#

340
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,360
That was awesome, Fujiko-san!
 I can't believe the fight you put up!

341
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,860
Looks like the final match will be one for the history books!

342
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,150
Fujiko-san, let's have a good match.

343
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,330
Beanpole, if you shilly-shally out there, you'll fall into Yawara's positioning.






344
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,450
It's all in how you engage her.

345
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,960
Now beat Yawara!

346
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,330
