00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,210
She's late!

2
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,990
How long is that dumb office girl gonna sleep in?

3
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,990
I'll beat some character into her yet!

4
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,170
Good morning!

5
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,450
What? Beanpole?

6
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,110
Why are you acting surprised?

7
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,960
I came for some early morning training to prepare for the All-Japan Championships tomorrow.

8
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,470
Now, if you please!

9
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,460
H-Hey, wait!

10
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,920
Glad I caught you!

11
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,360
Now go beat that goldbricking, idiotic office girl of ours outta bed!

12
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,900
Let's see, so when you do the Swan Lake, you do this, and this...

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,470
Hey, you listening?

14
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,680
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.

15
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,980
Inokuma-san must've arrived at Haneda by now.</i>

16
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,740
So you have to go on this company trip?

17
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm sorry.



18
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you saying? This is your first job. You need to be reliable!

19
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,500
Fujiko-san...

20
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,630
Score an Ippon with this assignment!

21
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,630
I'll be all right.

22
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,880
Fujiko-san.

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,060
Are you stupid?!

24
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,850
What's with that lily-livered judo?!

25
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,480
Yes! Please be strict with me!

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
Get up!

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,500
Keep this up, and battling Yawara in the finals will be just a distant dream!

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,450
You're Not Losing by Default!

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,960
Wh-Why are you here?

30
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,210
What are you doing here, Inokuma-kun?

31
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,220
Forgive me. I missed the train, so I came by monorail.

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,470
I'll go and prepare for our boarding!

33
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,180
N-No, that's not what I...

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,350
Hey, Inokuma-kun!

35
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,360
Okay, I get it.</i>



36
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,270
She's just here to say goodbye and see us off.</i>

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,400
So that's how it is. I'm going to get canned.

38
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,780
Oh, hi there!

39
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,450
They're here!


40
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,270
This is the managing director of Toyosan Motors, Katagiri-san.

41
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,360
He's the major Inokuma-san fan I told you about.

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,460
It's a pleasure to meet you!

43
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, the p-pleasure is all mine!

44
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,180
U-Um, the thing is...

45
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,620
Oh, there she is!

46
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,930
This way, gentlemen! I'd like you to meet Inokuma Yawara-san!

47
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,930
It's over.</i>

48
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,580
It's a pleasure to meet you!

49
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,940
Oh, you're right! It's Inokuma Yawara in the flesh!


50
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:25,580
I just love the way you play judo! Especially your Ippon Zeoi!

51
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,870
Thank you very much!

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,680
Um, I'm still a new employee, and there are many things I'm not familiar with,

53
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,830
but I'll do my very best on this trip.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,750
"Th-This trip"?</i>



55
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,870
Oh please, it will be our pleasure having you along!

56
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,300
So what she just said means she's going to Hokkaido?</i>

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,310
B-But then what about tomorrow's All-Japan Championships?</i>

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,120
We just got a call from Assistant Manager Hagoromo!

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,480
They departed Haneda on Flight 505 at 9:20.

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,270
Yes, that's the way, Hagoromo-kun!

64
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,500
You just got us a round of promotions!

65
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,540
Then at tomorrow's All-Japan Championships, Inokuma Yawara will explode with a—

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,620
Ah yes, Inokuma-kun is off today in preparation for tomorrow, right?

67
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,270
Oh, actually Inokuma-san left with Assistant Manager Hagoromo.

68
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,150
For where?

69
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,500
Hokkaido.

70
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,470
What was that?

71
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,710
Like I said, Inokuma-san went to Hokkaido.




72
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,980
She went there with Assistant Manager Hagoromo to entertain the guests from Kato Chu.

73
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,990
What?!

74
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,950
Inokuma Yawara also went to Hokkaido?!

75
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,660
P-Please forgive me, sir!

76
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,710
You blockhead!

77
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,460
Get her back! Get Inokuma Yawara back right now! Understand?!

78
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,720
I swear, these people...

79
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,980
This is a pickle.

80
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,030
Inokuma is supposed to appear at the All-Japan as our company symbol.




81
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,940
Who knows how much publicity that'd get us?

82
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,350
God, yes!

83
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,780
And for what? So we can be exclusive travel agents for Kato Chu?

84
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,280
Indeed, sir.


85
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,770
It's just Kato Chu! It's just...

86
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,880
It's just...

87
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,440
Say, do you think we should look a little further into this?

88
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,950
Let me put it this way.

89
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,480
Exactly how much money <i>will</i> we make per annum if we get Kato Chu?

90
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,890
It's not important, but it's still good to know how much money we might lose.

91
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,220
Understood, sir. Right away.

92
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,730
Twe... Twe... Twen...

93
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,940
Yes!

94
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,800
Twenty billion?

95
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,940
Yes!

96
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,870
T-Twenty billion?

97
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,980
W-Wait! What if it turns out that...

98
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,020
that we then... um...

99
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,920
No, we need to keep our heads here!

100
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,690
S-Sir, are you okay?

101
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,870
You don't look well.

102
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,780
Call the branch manager.

103
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,350
Uh, which one?

104
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,860
The one at Shinbocho!

105
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Right!



106
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,180
He doesn't have to get Inokuma Yawara back!

107
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,370

A complete lockdown? Wh-What do you mean?

130
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,320
Our branch manager ordered us not to allow any coverage or interviews

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,620
with Inokuma-san for three days!

132
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,190
Wh-Why did he do that?

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,070
I don't know.

Don't worry. She must be home, even as we speak.

It's nice to know that you're well!

142
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,270
If you'll excuse me...

143
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,280
Hold on! You're trying to run away, aren't you?

144
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,170
N-No, that's absurd!

O-Oh, uh, well...

147
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,530
I was wondering if Yawara-san was also doing well.

148
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,030
Yawara! So she came back?!

149
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,000
No, as I thought, she wasn't in.

150
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,960
"As I thought"?

151
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,240
Whaddaya mean, "As I thought"?

N-No, wait...

153
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,010
You're hiding something, ain't you?

154
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,010
I-I promise you I'm not hiding anythi—

155
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,330
An Okuri Eri Jime! And a fast one too!

156
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,020
Wait, this is no time to be impressed.

157
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,940
Kazamatsuri! You know what's going on with Yawara-san, don't you?!

158
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,130
I-I <i>do</i> know!

159
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,740
I'll talk! Just let me go!

160
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,740
Hokkaido?!

161
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,670
What in blazes is Yawara doing in Hokkaido?

162
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,470
Sh-She asked for my advice on whether to enter the tournament or go on a work assignment!

163
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,210
Wait, you didn't tell her to...

164
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,760
O-Oh, of course not.

165
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,940
Y-Yawara-san is the jewel of the judo world!

166
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,590
She doesn't have time to go on some corporate junket!

167
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,680
I told her she must enter the tournament!

168
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,180
But even at that, it still looked like she was confused.

169
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,150
I was worried about her, so I came here.

170
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,650
I-It's true!

171
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,700
That dingbat!



172
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,240
Inokuma-san actually played in a golf foursome!

173
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,660
Oh, it was only for a short time.

174
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,170
That's right. Let's have Inokuma-san play tomorrow as well!

175
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,090
Now wait, I can't possibly do that!

176
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,670
Oh, come on. It'll be fun!

177
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,150
But I've never played a full course!

178
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,390
J-Just keep her here?
But I've never played a full course!

179
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,670
Don't worry. You'll do fine!
J-Just keep her here?

180
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,010
Don't worry. You'll do fine!

181
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,650
B-But, sir...
Don't worry. You'll do fine!

182
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,140
O-Oh, does the company president know about this?

183
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:52,270
He was the one who told me not to bring Inokuma Yawara back in the first place!

184
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:58,110
B-But if we don't, then she won't appear in tomorrow's All-Japan!

185
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
Forget about judo tournaments!

186
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,000
What's important right now is Kato Chu!

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,380
F-Forget about it?

188
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,900
Listen, Hagoromo-kun! If you pull this off without a hitch, we'll all get promoted!

189
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,810
Now make sure it goes well. I'm begging you!

190
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,870
Forget about...

191
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,200
judo tournaments?

192
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm going to bed now.

193
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,980
I have to play golf tomorrow.

194
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,320
O-Oh, so you're going to play golf?

195
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,230
Okay, if you'll excuse me.

196
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,720
Ah, Inokuma-kun.

197
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,280
Yes?

198
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,280
Nah, never mind.

199
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,250
Good night.

200
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,170
Good night, sir!

201
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,370
Forget about judo.

202
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,940
Forget about it, huh?

208
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,180
Hey, Matsuda! Phone!

209
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,300
Who the hell'd call when I'm busy?

210
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,600
Yeah, hello?!

212
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,660
I always enjoy reading your articles. I'm a fan.

213

Thanks a lot. Bye now!

214
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,070
W-Wait!

215
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,740
I'm thinking of sending Inokuma Yawara back!

216
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,020
I'm thinking of sending Inokuma Yawara back on the first plane tomorrow morning!

I'm her supervisor, Hagoromo.

Your articles always excite me when I read them.

220
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,450
She's in Hokkaido right now.

221
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,060
She might make it if she takes the first plane.

222
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,620
I can't rely on anybody inside my company.

223
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,280
I can only rely on you, Matsuda-san!

224
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,600
The plane will arrive at Haneda at 9:50!

225
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,540
Please, go and pick her up!

It's now 7:30 and time for sports.

235
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,880
First up, the All-Japan Women's Judo Championship will finally be held.

236
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,770
All eyes are on the match between Inokuma Yawara and Honami Sayaka.

237
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,390
Now then, let's have a look at what the players are doing this morning.

238
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,320
Right! Here we are in front of Honami Sayaka-san's mansion!



239
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,390
The prospect of her first official match after a long absence has attracted a lot of reporters.

240
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,770
The gates have opened!
 Honami Sayaka is about to leave!

241
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,430
A word!

242
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,440
Honami-san!

243
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,540
Honami, can you speak to us?

244
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,740
What about your match with Inokuma-san?

245
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,860
What are your feelings right now?

246
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,850
To all of you watching right now, don't forget to program your video recorders.

247
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,830
I invite you to watch Inokuma Yawara's crushing defeat at my hands, repeatedly.

248
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,460
Wh-What the...

249
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,440
An amazing display of confidence by Honami.

250
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,760
The results of her secret, ten-month training will finally be unveiled.

251
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,720
Here we are with Saikai U's judo team.







252
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,350
Because we've been barred from interviewing Inokuma for some reason,

253
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,810
we'll speak to Ito Fujiko, who made a strong showing at the World Championships.

254
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,660
Today's the day. So how are you feeling?

255
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,770
Oh, yes! I'll give it my all and do what I can!

256
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,280
Inokuma-san, I'll fight hard! Very hard!

257
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,720
Oh, looks like she's raring to go.

258
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,890
Will she go all the way to the finals and fight her friend there?

259
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,290
This will be a very exciting All-Japan Women's Judo Championships!

260
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,470
Boy, if you keep teeing off like that, I'll never beat you!






261
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,940
Go easy on us in the actual match, Inokuma-san.

262
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,530
Huh? Wait a minute, Inokuma-san.

263
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,480
I thought you couldn't enter the tournament due a hip injury.

264
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,550
Inokuma-kun!

265
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,480
Yes?

266
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,580
Come here!

267
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,490
Hey!

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,180
What is it?

269
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,070
Never mind, just go!

270
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,530
Go? Go where?

271
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,040
To the Martial Arts Hall!

272
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,540
Everyone's waiting for you, including your rival and your friend!

273
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,580
But what about our assignment?

274
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,730
Who cares about the assignment?! This is something you have to do!

275
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,020
Your rival, Honami Sayaka, trained intensively for ten months just to beat you!

276
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,410
Your friend, Ito Fujiko, plans to win all her matches in order to play you!

277
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,900
How do you know all that?

278
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,790
If you read <i>All Sports News</i> every day, you'd know that!

279
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,910
Their articles about your judo career always excite me!

280
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,230
<i>All Sports News</i> is the only thing I look forward to anymore.

281
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,880
It's thanks to Matsuda. Practically no one else writes with such gusto!

282
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,870
Matsuda-san?

283
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,030
I called a taxi!

284
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,130
There it is! Get in!

285
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,660
But right now my job takes priority over judo.

286
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,480
Then why were you running around the hotel at the break of dawn?

287
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,650
Why were you practicing your ukemi and uchikomi on the front lawn?

288
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,670
You saw that? But I do that every day out of habit.











289
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,140
You have to play judo!

290
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,040
You can't be here working!

291
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,710
Your flight to Tokyo leaves at 8:20! I've already made the reservations!

292
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,620
Matsuda will be waiting at Haneda!

293
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,130
Matsuda-san?

294
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,130
She's all yours! Chitose Airport, and step on it!

295
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,470
But what about our assignment with Kato Chu Company?

296
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,970
I'm ordering you as your supervisor! Now go!

297
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,100
Yes, sir!

298
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,480
And toss Honami on her butt! That's an order!

299
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,440
Yes, sir!



300
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,740

Even though you're the one asking, we can't delay the tournament until Yawara-san arrives!

304
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,340
Then change the date!

305
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,790
That's even more impossible!

306
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,220
You mean you don't have the authority to match that big face of yours?!

307
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,850
Hi! Too much anger isn't good for your health!

308
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,250
Oh, Kuni-chan! It's rare to see you cover stuff by yourself.

309
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,030
I know.

310
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,780
Can you believe Kosaku left me with the reporting duties while he went off somewhere?

311
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,990
Oh well, I guess that means he really trusts me!

312
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,350
Ah, I almost forgot!






313
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,790
He also told me to give you this letter. Here!

314
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,290
Letter?

315
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,510
Gimme that!

Matsuda is bringing Yawara here?!

318
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,760
But they won't make it with a 9:50 arrival!

319
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,870
Then put your neck on the line and delay the tournament!

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,900
Accept my apologies!

This is not what you promised!

I'm terribly sorry! I accept all responsibility!

Having your ass fired several times over won't nearly be enough!

328
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,580
This is the critical moment for whether we get to be

the sole exporters of Toyosan's vehicles to Eastern Europe!

330
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,760
Hell, seeing you guillotined a million times won't be enough!
