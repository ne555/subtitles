There are less than 30 seconds left!

Is Tohdoh's victory all but assured?

3
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,910
Back collar!

4
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,210
Let me go to the final round!

5
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,830
Ito forces an Uchi Mata!

6
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,550
Forget it! You ain't getting nothing with that stance!

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,550
You have no choice! Do it with everything you've got, Fujiko-san!

8
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,550
Tohdoh resists! Only a few seconds left!

Ito forces an Uchi Mata!

Tohdoh resists!

...being lifted up!

16
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,160
Incredible!

17
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,430
What the...

18
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,240
Waza Ari!

I-It's a Waza Ari!

23
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,960
Ito's last minute Uchi Mata gets her a Waza Ari!



24
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,490
And that's the end of the match!

25
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,650
So that means...

26
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,730
What does that mean?

27
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,660
Um, let's see...

28
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,490
Fujiko-san got a Yuko at the start,
 then Todo-san got a Waza Ari, then...

29
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,500
Fujiko-san!

30
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,740
Fujiko-san!

31
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,510
She won!

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,590
It went down to the wire!

33
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,810
She made a huge comeback with a last minute Uchi Mata to get a Waza Ari!

34
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,880
Ito Fujiko... will face Inokuma Yawara in the final round!

Whoa...

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,200
Ito Fujiko actually won!

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,770
Say what you will, she made it to the final round!

39
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,480
Even Inokuma-san will have a hard time handling that intensity.

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,250
What? That total newcomer will be no match for Inokuma-san! Right, Mr. Katagiri...

41
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,340
H-Huh?

42
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,260
Whoops...

43
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,530
What a blast! I'm really having fun today!

44
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,470
You rarely see interesting judo matches like these!

45
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,700
That's the managing director of Toyosan for you.

46
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,520
You also recognize Ito's talents. You really do know your judo!

47
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,750
Shucks.

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,740
Still, I'm amazed you managed to get
 Inokuma-san to her tournament on time.

49

Never underrate this travel agency, sir!

50
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,410
Oh, is that right?



51
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,250
You still ruined our company golf tour, Mr. Hotshot!</i>

We really were the best women's collegiate judo team in the country!

Two of our former teammates made it to the final of the All-Japan Championships!

56
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,930
You made us proud!

57
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,220
I promise the best team in the nation will remain proud after this match!

58
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,940
That was cool, Fujiko-san!




59
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,090
You were really incredible out there, Fujiko-san!

60
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,950
There aren't many people who can put up a fight like that.

61
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,420
You put on a strong performance for the cameras, just like me!

62
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,700
You had us on pins and needles, but you won anyway!

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,710
Please, I'm not that good!

64
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,990
There's even a small chance you could make it to Barcelona!

65
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,040
It's not a small chance. She's perfectly capable of going there!

66
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,910
No, I'm not that good.

67
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,720
A-A massage?

68
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,440
Yes. Yawara-san is giving one to Fujiko-san.

69
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,720
Why are our two finalists making nice with each other?

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,020
You're right. That presents a problem.

71
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,940
A problem?

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,470
Yawara-san certainly is strong.




73
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,740
But that may be her sole weakness.

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,650
Actually, that's what I really like about her.

75
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,700
What? Quit grinning and spit it out!

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,300
At any rate, Yawara-san is a gentle spirit.

77
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,140
We don't know if she'll fight Fujiko-san wholeheartedly.

78
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:12,640
She <i>did</i> enter the All-Japan judo tournament to lend Fujiko-san moral support.

79
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,480
Considering that, will she be ruthless with Fujiko-san?

80
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,360
No, Yawara-san is too gentle to be capable of that.

81
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,800
He's right. It's just like he said.</i>

82
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,650
Damn you, Kazamatsuri, for once you're actually being perceptive!</i>

83
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,170
Yawara-san, don't get any stupid ideas! You must fight for real!</i>

84
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,730
I know I'm no match for you, but I'll do my best because it'll be good practice!

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,960
That's not true. You've improved incredibly.

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,220
Let's make it a great match.

87
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,490
Yeah.

88
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,420
I'll see you out there.

89
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,870
It's that tenacity.

90
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,020
Huh?

91
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,510
The only thing that can defeat Yawara is Beanpole's tenacity.

92
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,410
M-Master, are you still trying to make Yawara-san lose?

93
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,580
Of course I am!

94
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,960
The only way to close the book on her stupid office girl career is for her to lose!

95
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,970
Oh.

96
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,360
Coach Yutenji. Master Jigoro.
 It's thanks to you that I'm here.

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,860
It's all in the approach!

98
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,020
Shilly-shally out there, and you'll fall into her sweet spot.

99
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,690
The fight is all in the approach!

100
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,150
B-But, Master...

101
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,040
Yes, sir!

102
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,030
Yawara-san!

103
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,170
Ah, Matsuda-san!

104
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,880
Is your leg all right?

105
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,480
This is no time to worry about me!

106
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,880
Please, this is no joke. Fight her for real!

107
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,090
Miss Inokuma, it's time!

108
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,930
Okay!

109
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,730
Hey!

110
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,440
Wh-What?

111
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,090
Wh-What was that just now?

112
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,910
Th-That smile. Is she going to...

113
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,260
Yawara-san!

114
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,990
Inokuma Yawara and Ito Fujiko!

115
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,230
Both players have entered the ring!

116
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,670
Bleh, how detestable!

117
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,710
"Can you keep up with my training?" My foot!

118
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,830
For ten months on that mountain, I did everything Coach Inokuma Kojiro told me to do.

119
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,640
I was covered in dirt and sweat, but all it got me was this.

120
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,710
B-But, Milady, that left Uchi Mata was marvelous to behold!

121
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,700
You very nearly scored an Ippon on Inokuma Yawara.

122
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,440
Indeed!

123
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,700
It's because of Inokuma Kojiro's feeble little plan

124
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,870
that I suffered the utter humiliation of <i>almost</i> getting an Ippon!

125
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,930
That coach is fired!

126
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,130
Milady!

127
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,090
It's been less than two years since Ito Fujiko started playing judo.

128
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,220
Yet she defeated the veteran Tohdoh Yuki and advanced to the final!











129
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,640
Ito Fujiko and her towering figure have finally arrived!

130
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,610
It takes 99 percent effort and one percent luck.</i>

131
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,070
You'll need that one percent in order to defeat Yawara!</i>

132
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,570
Lady luck may have skipped Honami Sayaka.</i>

133
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,620
But that tall girl...</i>

134
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,620
Order up. One large oyako donburi.

135
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,280
Forget about her.






136
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,080
Even if that beanpole's got good momentum, she's no match for Inokuma Yawara.

137
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,300
Oh? Still, you never know what that girl is capable of.

138
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,140
Sir, you might be a judo fanatic, but you're still an amateur.

139
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,170
Forget it. There's no hope for her.

140
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,590
Here's her opponent, Inokuma Yawara!

141
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,340
Gold medalist in both the World Cup open-weights and World Championship 48 kg class!

142
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,940
There's no denying she's world famous!
 Will Inokuma Yawara remain invincible?

143
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,540
The referees are in position, and it's about to begin!

144
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,040
Don't go soft!

145
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,530
Give it all you've got, Yawara-san!

146
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,390
That's too tall an order.

147
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,050
You can't seriously expect her to toss Fujiko-san on her back.

148
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,490
Fight her for real!

149
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,050
Remember, Fujiko-san somehow fought an even match with Teleshikova!

150
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,020
Please, make this last match count!

151
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,570
EyeCatch






152
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,670
Thank God.</i>

153
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,010
Inokuma-kun did very well up till now.</i>

154
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,460
Katsuo, Honey, I may be fired from my job...</i>

155
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,510
but don't worry. I'll figure something out.</i>

156
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,860
I'll think of a way out of this jam,
 just like Inokuma-kun!</i>

157
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,460
All right.

158
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,970
Time for the final match!

159
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,270
Hurry up, Hagoromo-kun! The match is starting!

160
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,180
Right!

161
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,600
Inokuma-san and Ito Fujiko, make this a good match!

162
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,940
Give it all you've got!

163
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,940
This is the All-Japan Women's Judo Championships,

164
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,430
and the final match is about to begin!

165
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,660
Wh-Who should we cheer for?

166
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,900
We'll figure it out through rock-paper-scissors!

167
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,450
Both of you, good luck!

168
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,440
Yawara-san, don't hold back!

169
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,210
You're wasting your breath. She's not going to fight Fujiko-san for real.

170
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,610
Master Inokuma.

171
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,720
Beanpole has a real chance of winning.

172
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,730
Inokuma-san...</i>

173
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,730
I first saw you on television two years ago.</i>

174
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,120
There it is! Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi!

175
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,780
You threw a huge opponent through the air.</i>

176
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,850
It was like you were cheering me on,</i>

177
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,370
telling me to keep fighting, 
even after I gave up my ballet dreams.</i>

178
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,960
Thank you, Inokuma-san.</i>

179
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,720
Right now I feel like...</i>

180
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,650
I've gone back in time to when I aspired to be a prima ballerina.</i>

181

I'm giving it my all, so the two of you should do your best!</i>

Hajime!

188

It's started!

Ito grabs a good spot!

196

See? She's giving her that grip, just as I predicted.

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,900
Don't hold back!

198
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,580
You can do it. Just get the timing down!</i>

200
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,480

I can't stand on my own feet!</i>

204
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,710
Ippon!

205
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,940
Done!

206
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,980
I... I flew.

207

O-Oh my gosh.</i>

I... I can't believe she's this amazing.</i>

209
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,230
Or this strong!</i>

210
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,200
Inokuma-san!</i>

211
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,950
Fujiko-san? Are you okay?

212
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,990
Ito Fujiko is now raising Inokuma Yawara's hand high in the air!

213
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,020
Inokuma has won the All-Japan Women's Judo Championships!

214
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,710
She unleashed an earth-shattering Ippon Zeoi that literally threw Ito Fujiko through the air!

215
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,040
You couldn't ask for a better Ippon win!

216
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,810
Inokuma Yawara is not giving up her throne so easily!





217
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,060
You two were wonderful!

218
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,870
So cool!

219
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,090
You guys were awesome!

221
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,170

You've been a sports writer for how many years, Matsuda Kosaku?</i>

223
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,220
You thought Yawara-san would go easy on Fujiko-san out of kindness?</i>

224
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,720
She didn't hold back against Fujiko-san because she is kind.</i>

225
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:48,410
Dammit, you still have a lot to learn, Matsuda Kosaku!</i>

226
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,690

Okay!

229
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,790
By the way, Master, what about your plan to make Yawara-san quit her office job?

230
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,430
That Ippon Zeoi left no room for complaints.

231
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,350
We're gonna have to put our plans to make her quit and transfer to Saikai U on hold.

232
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,480
Huh? You're kidding!

233
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,410

Thank you very much.

238
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,730
See, what did I tell you? Ito wasn't a match for her.

239
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,450
Well, I guess even an amateur should...

240
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,900
Let me make a phone call.

241
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,780
Hello? Oh.

242
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,210
I'm amazed you're bold enough to call me right now.

243
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,250
I did what you taught me, but I ended up losing.

244
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,760
This is your fault. How do you propose to take responsibility?

245
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,150
Stop complaining, and come get me.

246
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm at a soba shop in Shinbocho's 3-chome area.

247
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,270
Get you? So that means... You're saying...

248
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:15,280
This time you'll team up with me sincerely in my efforts to defeat Inokuma Yawara?

249
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,150
Just shut up, and come get me!

250
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,310
I placed a huge order, but I don't have the money.

251
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,470
Dear, he's not going to pay!

252
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,460
What can I say, Yawara-san?</i>

253
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,380
You were wonderful, Inokuma-san!

254
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you very much, sir.

255
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:35,640
That Ippon Zeoi... That glow...</i>

256
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,900
I should be the one thanking you!
That Ippon Zeoi... That glow...</i>

257
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,460
You landed a blow against Honami Sayaka right in front of our company signboard!

260
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,670
Um, how is Assistant Manager Hagoromo doing in Hokkaido?

261
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,480
Hokkaido? Oh, there's no hope for that.

262
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,990
Honami Travel can have Kato Chu for all I care!

263
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,330
So it's all my fault.

264
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,260
I made a mess of Mr. Hagoromo's assignment.








265
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,960
Did you see that? That's Inokuma-san's hidden strength!

266
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,490
Gosh, watching judo with you makes it twice as much fun!

267
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,400
Right back at you, you big lug!

268
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,470
Stop it! That's the managing director!

269
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,520
I'm fired anyway, so we're just two judo fans!

270
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,450
You ruined this outing, so quit yukking it up!

271
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,520
I swear...

272
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,980
this has been a really fun corporate trip.

273
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,260
And it's all thanks to Hagoromo-san!

but that amazing Ippon Zeoi she lost to...

I-Is that so?

281
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,010

I thought I'd do an Ouchi Gari after faking an Uchi Mata.

What a great strategy! And then?

290
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,030
It didn't work. I couldn't even stand up!

291
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,250
Before I knew it, I was flying through the sky.

292
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,760
I see. You flew through the sky!

293
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,720
I did! "Strong" doesn't even begin to describe her!

I'm really glad I'm playing judo!

295

Playing against a strong opponent like her was the absolute best!

Ippon! You got me there!

297
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,730
Nope, an Ippon Zeoi!

No, that there's a Yuko!

You have a telephone call from Tokyo.

307
