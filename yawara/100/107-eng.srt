Thank you very much.

You're wrong. That was a Seoi Otoshi.

N-No, though he should've been here already.

That assistant manager Hagoromo-san probably screwed up again.

You mean the corporate outing with Kato Chu?

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,240
Y-Yes?

180
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,960
You have a bad leg. You need to rest.

181
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,500
I'll clean up for you later.

182
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,760
No, that's fine! There are a bunch of documents and stuff I need to sort myself.

183
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,020
Matsuda-san.



184
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,510
Thank you for what you did.

185
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,510
Because of you, my assignment in Hokkaido turned out well.

186
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,770
Enough of that!

187
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,520
I should thank you for giving me a great article to write.

188
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
My assistant manager Hagoromo also wanted to thank you for what you did.

189
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,760
He's a big fan of yours, Matsuda-san.

190
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,490
Of mine?

191
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,150
He said your article made him relive the excitement from yesterday!

192
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,990
He also said there aren't many writers who could do that.




193
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,000
Well...

194
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,260
He said you must love judo a lot.

195
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,670
It made me happy to hear that.

196
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,110
Sheesh, that Kamoda! When did he put that up?

197
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,610
M-Matsuda-san, you're still using that photo as a poster?

198
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,070
Uh, um... sorry.

199
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,080
I'm losing my patience here!

200
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm back.

201
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,640
Oh, you're early. What do you want for dinner?

202
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,910
Don't bother.

203
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,870
Gosh, were you out drinking again?

204
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,550
I've got a hangover. They made me drink well into the morning in Hokkaido.

205
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,970
I've heard enough. And you call that an "assignment"?

206
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,270
My assignment went great.
 I landed a big one this time.

207
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,390
Geez, another fish story?

208
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,980
I mean it this time.

209
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,490
Papa! Where's my crab?!

210
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,080
D-Don't yell. My ears are ringing.

211
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,680
But you said you'd bring me a crab! A crab!

212
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,210
I'll have the crab shipped to you by air!

213
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,950
I was waiting for the crab, not for you.

214
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,680
Can you turn that down?!

215
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Leave him alone. He just got back from cram school.

216
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,150
Katsuo.

217
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,150
Will you be playing judo?

218
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,660
That was great!

219
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,330
There's more where that came from.

220
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,620
No, I'm full.

221
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,430
Okay, I'll put on some tea.

222
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,330
Oh, thanks.

223
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,570
I have to say, your cooking is delicious.

224
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,840
Those little dumplings and those spring rolls were outstanding.

225
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,070
Um, those weren't Chinese food.

226
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,850
They were Italian dishes, cannelloni and ravioli.

227
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,350
Oh, Italian? You mean the leader of The Drifters?

228
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,900
No, that's Ikariya!

229
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,480
Uh, never mind.

230
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,100
Still, I can't believe how well you cleaned this place!

231
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,360
Is this really my room?

232
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,990
You said the same thing last time.

233
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,120
Here, it's hot.

234
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, thanks.



235
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,080
It's been a long while since you last came here.

236
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,080
I was still in high school.

237
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,380
There was that media frenzy when everyone found out who you were.

238
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,760
You had no choice but to hide out at my place.

239
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,640
It was all your fault in the first place, remember?

240
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,780
Is everything all right?

241
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,610
I-I'm fine.

242
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,150
I told you it was hot.

243
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,110
Time really does fly.

244
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,580
So it's been four years, huh?

245
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,720
Four years?

246
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,160
Time went by so quickly.

247
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,660
It's getting late!

248
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,880
Very late indeed!



249
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Sorry, Dad. I'll bring out the miso soup right away.

250
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,200
No, I was talking about Yawara.

251
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,340
Where did that idiot office girl of ours run off to?

252
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,350
I'm sure her coworkers are holding a victory celebration for her.

253
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,840
Getting drunk after another victory, is she?

254
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,360
She's bound to stumble if she goofs off too much!

255
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,260
You competitors live a tough life.

256
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,490
Here's your miso soup.

257
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,110
This is great!

258
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,190
Tamao-san! This chicken stew is delectable!

259
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,570
There's more where that came from.

260
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,330
That's right. We competitors have it rough. Just look at Beanpole!

261
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,930
I couldn't agree more. You were helping her train today, the day after the tournament.

262
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,340
That's the way it should be! I only wish Yawara would follow her example.

263
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,100
Fujiko-san should've eaten something before leaving.

264
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
He's not home yet? I see.

265
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,290
Oh, it's fine. Goodbye.





266
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,040
Hanazono-san must be doing a lot of training.

267
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,150
Up this late?</i>

268
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,790
Morio, you're silly!

269
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,120
It's true, I swear!

270
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,230
No way!

271
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,590
He's such an honest, sweet, wonderful man.</i>

272
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,090
Of course other women would want him!</i>

273
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,080
N-No way!

274
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,310
Hanazono-san must be training hard at judo!

One of the newlyweds wanted to sleep in our tour guide's room,

279
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,530
because she couldn't stand being with him!

280
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,540
Being a tour guide sounds like a rough job!

281
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,660
It sure is!

282
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,500
Wow, look at the time!

283
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,770
I'll walk you to the station.

284
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,500
You can't, not with that leg.

285
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,300
Oh, right.

286
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,010
I'll just make a fuss if I trip and fall again.

287
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,060
You're absolutely right.

288
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,980
Maybe I should stay the night, like last time.

289
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,980
No, I was only kidding!

290
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,720
O-Oh, right. Of course you were!

291
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,990
Don't spring that on me!

292
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,570
You startled me when you spit out your tea!

293
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,490
S-Sorry.

294
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:35,460
However, if I do spend the night here,
 you're sleeping outside like you did last time!

295
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,500
Hey, then I'll catch another cold!

296
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,970
Do you really want to stay the night?

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,570
Nah, just joking.

Kosaku! It's me!

301
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,330
Are you getting your rest?

302
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,830
Oh?

303
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,590
Kuniko-san!

304
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,710
Oh, if it isn't Yawara-chan?

305
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,050
Did you come to see how he's doing? Why, thank you!

306
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,060
I guess you would, because it's your fault Kosaku hurt his leg.

307
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,850
Wh-What are you doing here?!

308
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,580
"What," you ask?

309
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,360
This is food for dinner, and these are the toiletries I always bring for the night!

310
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,780
Toiletries? What the hell?!

311
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,080
What's wrong?

312
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,820
If you'll excuse me, I'll be leaving.

313
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,830
Oh, really? Take care!

314
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,830
Hey, wait up!

315
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Hey, Yawara-san!

316
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,290
You can't walk on that foot!

317
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,860
Yawara-san!

318
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,760
Kosaku, stay put!

319
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,410
Lemme go!

320
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,510

322
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,450
Come on, Kosaku, back inside we go!

323
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,460
You need to sit still and rest!

324
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,540
Ow, quit pulling!

325
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,430
Besides, why are you even here?!

326
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,180
That's mean!

327
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,950
I came here to see how you were doing,
 but you prefer Yawara-chan over me?

328
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,350
N-No, that's not what I'm saying at all!

329
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,050
Then forget about her! Get in here!

330
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:52,080
So he was two-timing her? That guy next door's really got it going on!

What should I do?

Concentrate on intensive training!
