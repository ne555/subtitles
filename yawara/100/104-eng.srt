1
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,380
She's facing another large opponent, Uzaki.

2
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,590
This looks to be another exciting contest.

3
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,480
We thought Inokuma was going to lose by default for not making it to her first match,

4
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
but she arrived in the nick of time.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,510
However, she's proving again and again that she still has it.

6
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,180
Inokuma-kun...

7
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,340
You made it?

8
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,890
Ippon! Done!

9
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,530
She crushed her!

10
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,140
Inokuma Yawara tossed the heavyweight Uzaki through the air with her Ippon Zeoi!

11
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,650
It was worth it.

12
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,460
I'm not going to get fired for nothing.

13
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,150
Inokuma Yawara now advances to the semifinals!
I'm not going to get fired for nothing.

14
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,840
Inokuma Yawara now advances to the semifinals!

15
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,260
We've now come to our decisive battle of the tournament!

16
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,160
Her opponent in the semifinal match will of course be Honami Sayaka!

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,660
Players Waiting Room#
Her opponent in the semifinal match will of course be Honami Sayaka!

18
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,820
The time has come for you to kneel before me, Inokuma Yawara.

19
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,670
<b>The Fateful Showdown!</b>

20
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,430
Hurry, hurry! Why are you guys so slow?

21
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,310
The match between Yawara-chan and Fujiko-san will start if you don't move it!

22
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,010
It's your fault we have to run in the first place!

23
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,860
You were three hours late meeting us at that café!



24
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,980
Geez, don't blame me. I worked very late last night!

25
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,380
Actresses normally finish work at 2:00 or 3:00 AM.

26
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,170
I'm beat!

27
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,500
I lost weight!

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,340
I <i>really</i> want to make the most of my precious free time.

29
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,340
I don't want to spend it hearing about your stupid, fake acting career!

30
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,430
What do you mean, "fake acting career," cop bitch?

31
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,350
If you've been in any type of lewd adult video, I'll arrest you for criminal indecency!

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,390
Please, because of my high rank, I don't have to do any of <i>those</i> scenes.

33
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,360
You've actually appeared in that kind of video?







34
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm so gonna arrest you.

35
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,860
Excuse me.

36
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,420
I think we should hurry.

37
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,400
We might still get to see Inokuma-san compete,

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,340
but we won't get to see Fujiko-san if she's already lost.

39
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,410
You're always such a downer.

40
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,880
But no matter how good Fujiko-san is, 
these are still the <i>nationals</i>.

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,280
Anyway, let's go and watch!

42
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,530
Yeah!

43
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,450
Let's go!
Yeah!

44
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,050
Hurry!

45
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,050
This is the second match of the B Block quarterfinals.

46
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,310
The A Block features a semifinal match between Inokuma Yawara and Honami Sayaka.

47
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,030
In the B Block, Tohdoh Yuki has already advanced to the semis.

48
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,010
So who will end up in the final four?

49
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,070
Shiraishi of Kumamoto Women's Athletic College?

50
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,280
Or Saikai U's freshman athlete, Ito Fujiko?

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,910
Fujiko-san, hang in there!

52
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,330
Inokuma-san, wait for me.</i>

53
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,130
I'll definitely win the next two matches.</i>

54
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,840
I'll win them and meet you in the final match!</i>

55
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,360
Nice try!

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,700
Stranger things have happened in a competition!

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,220
If only it had rolled a little further!


58
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,350
Ito pulled off a superb Ouchi Gari Ippon win in her first match.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,140
She was aggressive in her second and third matches,

60
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,820
but how will she fare in this quarterfinal match?

61
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,350
Who cares about this match?

62
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,500
Hurry up and show the
 Inokuma-san vs. Honami match!

63
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,760
Get this thing over with already!

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,080
Why are you calling it "this thing"?

65
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,810
Ito Fujiko is almost as big a draw at this tournament as Inokuma and Honami.

66
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,790
Just sit and watch!

67
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,520
H-Hey!

68
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,550
Is that any way to talk to our guests from Toyosan?

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,830
Hell, I'm going to be fired anyway!</i>

70
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,230
If that's the case, who cares what happens next?</i>

71
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,800
Screw Kato Chu's negotiations!</i>

72
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,660
I'm only telling them how they should view the tournament.

73
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,810
Ito is Inokuma-san's best friend and her grandfather's best pupil!




74
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,330
You don't refer to her as "this thing"!

75
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,840
Get the hell out of here!

76
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,820
He's right!

77
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,750
I'm a big fan of Ito.

78
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,660
She may not be as good as Inokuma-san, but she plays excellent judo.

79
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,210
You sure know a lot about her, Mr. Tsurukame Travel.

80
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,760
It's because I read <i>All Sports News</i> every day.



81
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,780
It's great to see that the managing director of Toyosan knows his judo.

82
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,580
Yes, you're very right, Managing Director Katagiri.

83
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,390
Let's go and cheer her on!

84
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,140
Let's go, Ito!

85
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,150
Let's go, let's go, Ito! Let's go, let's go, Ito!

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,150
Hajime!

87
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,650
Ito's now fighting Shiraishi for the chance to advance to the semis!

88
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,290
Fujiko-san!

89
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,290
Yawara-chan!

90
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,460
Guys! You came?

91
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,730
Of course we did!



92
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,420
What would happen if the top college women's judo team didn't show up to cheer you on?

93
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,290
Follow me. Hurry!

94
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,300
Yay! Ringside seating!

95
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,430
Good! You grabbed a great spot!

96
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,520
Keep your eyes peeled and go for it!

97
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,120
Master Inokuma, where did you go when your prized pupil's playing her match?

98
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,430
I thought I was feeling out of it, but it turns out I forgot to eat.




99
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,130
That dingbat's tardiness messed up my usual rhythm.

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,510
It's all because she signed up with Mud Turtle Travel.

101
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,300
Don't think I'm just going to fire you, Hagoromo.


102
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,970
You left our 20 billion yen customer out in the cold.

103
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,510
When you get back to Tokyo, 
I'm beating the living crap outta...

104
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,650
You!

105
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,650
Yawara's grandfather!

106
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,900
You damned Mud Turtle kidnappers!

107
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,130
How dare you spirit my granddaughter off to Hokkaido!

108
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,990
W-We're not kidnappers!


109
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,710
You'd better not pull the same trick next time.

110
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,620
Otherwise, I'll make Yawara quit so fast your heads'll spin!

111
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,070
Q-Quit?

112
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,110
That's right! Also...



113
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,880
It's almost time for that showdown.

114
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,240
M-Marriage! If Sayaka-san wins, I'm marrying her!

115
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,350
It gives me the shivers just imagining it!

116
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,490
N-No! Shin-chan don't wanna! I don't wanna!

117
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,670
I've been waiting for you, Kazamatsuri-san.

118
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,670
Hey there, Kazamidori!

119
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,720
What's making you so jumpy?

120
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,600
I thought they made you president of Honami Travel.

121
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,430
Look, your rivals.

122
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,840
The president of Honami Travel?

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,440
S-So you're the young president everyone's talking about?!

124
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,690
President Ohtaguro of Tsurukame Travel?

125
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,750
H-How are you? I'm Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke.

126
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,280
I'm Ohtaguro of Tsurukame Travel.

127
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,420
Thank you. You're very kind.

128
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,970
It's an honor.

129
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,360
Dammit!</i>

130
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,590
We were about to take their Kato Chu account and deal this whelp a real blow!</i>

131
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,280
I gave him our Kato Chu account on a silver platter.</i>

132
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,550
Why did you call Yawara-san back from Hokkaido, you stupid executive!</i>




133
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,780
All I can do now is wait for Inokuma-san to toss Honami and leave this boy speechless.</i>

134
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,820
A-All I can do now is wait for Yawara-san to throw down Sayaka-san hard.</i>

135
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,610
S-So how do you think the match will go?



136
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,120
I see you fellas are already fighting it out!

137
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,450
N-No, I'm not actually rooting for—

138
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,770
You can rest easy, Kazamidori.

139
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,620
Miss Sayaka's in rare form,
 both physically and mentally.

140
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,460
I dunno who coached her, but I gotta hand it to him.

141
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,970
Compared to that, Yawara's barely even been practicing. She even showed up late!

142
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,350
Thanks to this thickheaded CEO!




143
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,640
Yawara might very well lose this.

144
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,020
Well, if she does lose,

145
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,360
she's quitting her job and going back into training at Saikai U.

146
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,230
Hell, losing would actually do her some good!

147
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,620
Fujiko-san, right now!

148
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,950
Get her!

149
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,290
Un! Deux! Trois!

150
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,790
Ippon! Done!

151
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,180
Ito gets an Ippon with her trademark Uchi Mata!

152
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,440
She'll face Tohdoh Yuki in the semifinals!

153
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,270
Guys! Thank you, guys!

154
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,640
You came for me?

155
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,900
You were awesome, Fujiko!

156
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,560
That was an incredible Ippon win!

157
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,440
You can do it, Fujiko-san! You're unstoppable!

158
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,000
Just one more. Just one more match.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,410
Then we can...

160
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,250
I still wish you luck, Inokuma-san.

161
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,250
Honami Sayaka is really in it to win!

162
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,420
Thanks!

163
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,130
You folks watching your TVs can probably tell

164
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,050
how the mood in the National Martial Arts Hall has taken an odd turn.

165
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,750
That's right. The long-awaited event for judo fans

166
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,240
and everybody else in the country has finally arrived!

167
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,360
It's finally here.

168
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,840
Yes, indeed.

169
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,030
Inokuma-kun!

170
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,130
The battle between Inokuma Yawara and Honami Sayaka is about to begin!

171
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,010
Even Master Jigoro wasn't sure?</i>

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,640
Shin-chan's... in a jam!</i>

173
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,670
M-Matsuda-san?

174
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,070
Ow!
M-Matsuda-san?

175
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,420
Watch where you're going, you dumbass!

176
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,880
Get off! I've got a broken leg... Ow!

177
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,040
Kazamatsuri-san, rejoice.

178
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,040
Get off! Get off me now. Come on!

179
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,750
I've already determined our wedding venue.

180
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,300
The Phoenix Room at the Honami Prince Hotel.

181
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,400
Get off! Ow!

182
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,570
It really hurts!

183
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,640
W-Wait. I don't think it's wise to jump the gun before the match.

184
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,870
There's no need to worry.



185
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,940
I will most certainly win,
 thanks to my secret weapon.

186
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,780
S-Secret weapon?

187
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,150
K-Kazamatsuri! What's this secret weapon of hers?!

188
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,460
I-I don't know!

189
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,800
You have to know! You're her coach, remember?!

190
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,290
It's Kojiro-san!

191
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,810
Inokuma Kojiro must've taught her something unimaginable!

192
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,400
Get off. The match is about to start!

193
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,810
If Sayaka-san wins...

194
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,990
No! No! I don't wanna! Shin-chan doesn't wanna!

195
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,150
W-Wait, Sayaka-san!

196
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,590
M-My gosh, what is this?

197
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,500
Honami is making a victory sign before the match!

198
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,620
She's also giving a "V for Victory" to the south seating!



199
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,420
I guess you can call it one of Honami Sayaka's flashy demonstrations.

200
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,630
Yes, but her actions up to now have mostly been mere bravado.

201
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,390
However, the speed and combination techniques we've witnessed today...

202
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,140
certainly attest to her ten-month training and give her a right to that confidence.

203
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,920
She's still at it!

204
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,110
She's now giving the victory sign to the east seating!

205
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,110
There goes that playful little scamp!

206
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,260
B-But that's too much!

207
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,050
Here comes Inokuma Yawara!

208
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,010
She's still living up to her myth of invincibility!

209
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,210
The world of Japanese women's judo rests on that small frame of hers!

210
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,020
Coming into the semis,
 she's won every match with ease!

211
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,320
Waiting for her is Honami Sayaka!

212
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,700
There she is, standing with a bold smile on her face!

213
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,690
Inokuma-san, hang in there!

214
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,720
I'll make it to the final match! So you have to too!







215
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,610
If she throws out a "scissors,"
 hit her with a "rock," Yawara-chan!

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,230
Just shut up and cheer for her!

217
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,430
W-We're counting on you, Inokuma-san.

218
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,240
With our work in Hokkaido in ruins,

219
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,210
please, please, throw down that Honami brat in front of our signboard!

Will it be Honami or Inokuma who advances to the final round?

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,600
Here he comes! Moguri Cap turns it up in the final stretch!

223

Go, go, Moguri Cap! I have 10,000 yen riding on you!

224

Oh, he's caught up! Will Moguri Cap outrun him? Only 120 meters left!

225
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,770
Both Inokuma and Honami have won all their matches with Ippons!

226
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,820
Sir...

227
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,370
More zarusoba.

228
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,650
M-More? But you already had so many bowls!






229
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,630
Let me watch my horse races!

230
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,630
Make it a large helping this time!

231
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,640
Right, right, a large order of zarusoba coming up.

232
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,970
The last time we saw these two fight was three years ago.

233
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,140
Back then Inokuma won with a lightning fast Ippon Zeoi.

234
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,530
Will Honami get revenge for that humiliating loss?

235
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,530
What do you think, Saito-san?

236
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,180
Let's see.

237
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,490
Like we just said, her ten-month training...

238
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,090
Revenge?

Don't let any conceited notions like "revenge" enter your mind.

242
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,090
You're facing a prodigy named Inokuma Yawara.

243
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,150
You'll get only one chance. Don't miss it.

244
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,960
When it comes, that's when you hit her with it!

245
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,390
Hey, he's mumbling something under his breath!

246
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,180
You'd better hope he's gonna pay for his food!

247
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,470
I don't care anymore!

248
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,970
Bow!

249
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,900
The time has finally come for you to grovel at my feet.

250
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Hajime!

251
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,470
They begin with a fierce struggle for the upper hand!

252
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,680
Kosoto Gari! But Inokuma avoids it!

253
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,180
Oh, Honami comes with an Ouchi Gari!

254
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,180
She's fast!

255
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,110
Inokuma-san!

256
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,180
I-I'm scared!

257
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,240
Honami's fast, almost too fast!

258
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,230
Inokuma's completely on the defensive!

259
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,410
Watch out!

260
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,900
Inokuma-san!

261
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,700
Inokuma fends it—

262
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,090
Yuko!

263
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,180
Jougai! Mate!

264
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,100
Honami hangs on!

265
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,340
She just barely survived Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi!

266
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,310
She may have suffered a Yuko, but she avoided something much worse!

267
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,250
I can't believe she withstood that Ippon Zeoi!

268
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,610
Shin-chan's in big trouble!

269
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,610
So close! She almost had her!

270
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,110
Get her with another one!

271
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,040
Honami really dodged a bullet!

272
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,300
Her Ippon Zeoi's gotten rusty, thanks to her life as a reprobate office girl.

273
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,410
If she's gonna lose, she'd better damn well hurry up!

274
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,840
M-Master, what on Earth are you saying?

275
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,700
That's for her sake!

276
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,800
If she loses, she can roll around crying all she wants.

277
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,830
I'm still taking her by the scruff of the neck to Saikai U for a whole lotta judo!

278
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Inokuma's short of breath!

279
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,360
She can't hide her shock at the way Honami's speed is running her ragged!

280
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,370
On the other hand, Honami is wearing an audacious smirk!

281
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,880
Damn that Honami wench!

282
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,790
S-Sir!

283
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,900
Oh, she almost won!





284
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,800
You can do it, Inokuma-san!

285
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,970
Don't get overconfident.

286
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,010
That Ippon Zeoi you avoided is just the first hurdle.

287
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,300
The real fight is about to start!

288
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,080
I've just fended off your celebrated technique.

289
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,760
What do you plan to do now... Inokuma Yawara?

290
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,010
What is it?

291
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,890
D-Did something happen?

292
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,220
She's serious. Yawara-san's now serious about this!

293
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,750
Of course she should be! It'd be bad if she wasn't!

294
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:38,700
It's that look she had when she fought Jody, who was very tough to beat!




295
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,140
She's the real deal.

296
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,450
Honami Sayaka... has really gotten better!
