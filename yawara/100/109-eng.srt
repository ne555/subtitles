00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,840
You dummy!

2
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,280
It's been a month since Hanazono-kun began practicing at our place.
You dummy!

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,060
Quit depending on your strength!
It's been a month since Hanazono-kun began practicing at our place.

4
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,620
Position yourself! Position!
It's been a month since Hanazono-kun began practicing at our place.

5
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,080
We practice three hours in the morning and three hours at night.

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,850
Right!
We practice three hours in the morning and three hours at night.

7
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,750
Faster!
We practice three hours in the morning and three hours at night.

8
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,620
Right!
We practice three hours in the morning and three hours at night.

9
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,870
Fight! Fight! Fight!
We practice three hours in the morning and three hours at night.

10
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,460
Fight! Fight! Fight!

11
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,550
Hanazono-kun still does his regular training at college.
Fight! Fight! Fight!

12
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,860
Hanazono-kun still does his regular training at college.

13
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:57,900
If this little thing makes you scream,
Hanazono-kun still does his regular training at college.

14
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm sure he'll get stronger.
If this little thing makes you scream,

15
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,020
Only two more months until the Shoujiki Cup.
you ain't getting stronger in a hundred years!

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,640
Only two more months until the Shoujiki Cup.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,100
Wait for us, Fujiko-san.

18
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,150
<b>Hanazono's Burning "I Love You"!</b>

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,860
One, two, three, four!

20
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,540
Faster! Your timing is lagging!

21
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,910
Right!

22
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,640
Keep going. Just ten more to go!

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,460
Keep going, for Fujiko-san's sake!

24
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,880
Is Fujiko-san doing all right?

25
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah! She's coming back from training camp today!

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,590
One, two, three, four!

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,700
I-I see, so she's doing well.

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,550
If I caused Fujiko-san to fall into a slump, then I'd lose everything!

29
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,060
Anyway, meet with her! I'm sure she's dying to see you.

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,900
Fujiko-san!

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,430
Hanazono-kun!



32
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,070
You guys are lucky.

33
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,070
It looks like you two are connected, even when you're apart.

34
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,830
That makes me really jealous.

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,330
Don't you have a man, Inokuma?

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,340
Fine, I'll introduce you to someone.

37
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,840
How about a guy like Matsuda-san?

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,350
Why must it be Matsuda-san?

39
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,310
Huh? You don't like him?


40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,640
I think he'd be good for you!

41
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,320
Matsuda-san's a great guy!

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,320
He already has a girlfriend!

43
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,070
All right, enough chit-chat!

44
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,380
...then that customer was wandering through the hotel corridor stark naked!

45
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,540
Isn't that funny?

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

47
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,970
Inokuma-san...

48
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,440
You're hiding something, aren't you?

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,970
L-Like what?

50
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,440
Hanazono-san.

51
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,090
Well...

52
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,400
It's fine. You don't have to say anything.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,740
You're hiding it because you don't want to hurt me.

54
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,320
I'm not actually hiding anything.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,580
It's fine.


56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,830
Anyway, just wait one more month.

57
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,290
One month?

58
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,320
Yes, one month.

59
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,010
You'll get to meet him in a month. Leave it to me.

60
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,410
It'll be all right!

61
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,020
What's with those weak hips!

62
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,630
The days went by, and summer was about to draw to a close.

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,870
Fujiko-san...

64
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,360
Sign: Judo Club#

65
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,820
Good!

66
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,660
Again!

67
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,120
Huh, what are you doing in those clothes, Senpai?

68
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,210
Looking good for our job interviews.

69
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,500
Oh, does that mean you'll be able to graduate, Senpai?

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,400
Don't worry about me!

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,630
Worry about how you'll fill our shoes next year!


72
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,930
We were already weak to begin with.

73
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,190
What will happen when we seniors graduate?

74
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,010
Hey!
What will happen when we seniors graduate?

75
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,770
Come here!

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,860
You get any job offers?

77
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,440
Yeah, fortunately.

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,070
All that's left is to see if we'll graduate.

79
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,800
We'll be sure to make a last splash at the tournament, Coach.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,560
At least we'll get through the second round.

81
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,740
About that,

82
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,260
I know you guys are ready to fight in your last tournament.

83
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,690
But the thing is, um...



84
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,880
The thing is that there's a good chance one of you three might not be a starter.

85
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,880
I-I'm telling you, the guy is just that good!



86
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,930
Well... Murada and Minami are kicking ass,

87
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,430
but who else could there be?

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,390
Hanazono!

89
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,380
Don't be ridiculous!

90
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,650
That womanizer! His hips are so worn out, he's useless!

91
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,650
You're such a kidder, Coach!

92
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,790
You gotta admit he's good!

93
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,750
Let's go again!

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,640
Hey, get up, willya?!

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,930
You think you'll get stronger just lying there?!

96
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,760
All right!

97
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,810
Still, I'm glad they picked you as a starter, Hanazono-kun!

98
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,810
Yes, it's all thanks to you and Master Jigoro!

99
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,780
Don't get giddy over being a starter for some no-name team!

100
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,450
See, this is what happens if you get distracted!

101
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,540
I-I see.




102
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,660
But are you sure I've become better?

103
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,130
What are you saying? You've gotten way better! Right, Grandpa?

104
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,180
That bearded daruma doll you call a coach has made you a starter.

105
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,130
That alone shows you've become reasonably better.

106
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,180
Y-Yes, sir.

107
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,140
But I still haven't thrown Inokuma even once.

108
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,020
Dummy! You ain't throwin' Yawara in a hundred years!

109
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,120
We taught you everything you're able to do. The rest is up to you!

110
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,340
You got it, Mountain Gorilla?

111
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,150
U-Uh, yeah.

112
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,080
If you've got it, then get to your randori!






113
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,500
You have a tournament coming up!

114
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,160
You'd better get moving too, Yawara!

115
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,660
Hanazono-kun, let's keep at it! Fujiko-san is waiting for you!

116
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,300
Fujiko-san...

117
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,120
All right!

118
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,370
Yes, that's the spirit!

119
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,270
Have I really gotten better?</i>

120
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,180
You don't accept it?

121
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,400
No! Why are you tossing me aside in favor of Hanazono?

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,190
I get what you're saying. I'm still pretty doubtful myself.

123
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,660
Then let me take him on in a match!

124
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,400
I'm not going to lose out to some skirt chaser!

125
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,860
Still...

126
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,450
Coach!

127
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,700
One! Two! Three!

128
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,960
Hey, Hanazono!

129
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,370
Yeah?

130
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,130
You're taking on Yoshida in a practice match.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,070
Okay.

132
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,050
Looks like we'll finally see what he's made of.

133
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,320
All right. Pretend this is a real match!

134
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,050
Get him, Yoshida!

135
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,260
Go get him!

136
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,140
Have I really become stronger?</i>
Go get him!

137
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,300
Come on. Give it to him!
Have I really become stronger?</i>

138
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,520
Go get him, Yoshida!

139
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,970
Kick that Lothario's ass!

140
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
Hajime!

141
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,570
I'm gonna bring you down to earth!</i>

142
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,450
Yuko!

143
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,500
Dumbass! You shot yourself in the foot!

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,450
Don't let him break out of your Uchi Mata!

145
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,540
Stop making him look good!

146
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,750
You bastard!

147
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,860
I can see it!</i>

148
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,280
His movements are so slow.</i>

149
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,570
I can now force a...</i>

150
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,390
Quit depending on your strength! Position yourself!

151
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,300
Ip...

152
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,590
Ippon! Done. Hanazono wins!

153
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,640
N-No, Yoshida-san wasn't slow.</i>

154
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,290
Inokuma's and Master Jigoro's judo is beyond amazing!</i>


155
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,140
Sparring with the guys going to the Shoujiki Cup has really worn me out!

156
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,310
Saikai U might win every single division this year.

157
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,610
I wonder what Hanazono-san is doing right now?</i>

158
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,950
F-Fujiko-san, this is Hanazono.

159
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,280
H-Hana... Hanazono-san?!

160
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,120
U-Um, I apologize for not calling you in a while.

161
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,880
It's fine! You don't have to apologize!

162
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,200
Um, I will state my business!

163
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,970
Yes?

164
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,680
I'll be playing in the Shoujiki Cup College Judo Tournament team matches tomorrow,

165
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,220
and I'll be participating in the individual matches the next day.

166
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,980
Just wait one more month.

167
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,390
I will win, win, and win it all, th-then...

168
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,800
then I, Hanazono Kaoru, will show myself to you!

169
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,950
Well then, good night!

170
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,480
But what if he doesn't win, win, and win it all?

171
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,270
Then what will happen?

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,420
Shoot, he's not here either!

177
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,480
Geez, which bathroom is he in?!

178
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,780
Hanazono-san! The first round is starting!

179
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,240

Fight!

Oh!

189
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,860
Um, shouldn't the male players be going to the tournament?

190
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,300
Oh, they're seeded. Their matches start after noon.

191
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,970
Oh, is that right? I should've known that would be the case for Saikai U.


192
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,310
I wonder if Hanazono-san is starting his match?</i>

193
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,270
Good luck, Hanazono-san!</i>

194
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,320
Inagaki-san! Good luck today!

195
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,830
Thanks! We'll win the team tournament and tomorrow's individuals!


196
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,320
Hope you guys cheer us on!

197
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,950
Oh, you know we will!

198
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,580
I-Inagaki-san is a 95 kg heavyweight, right?

199
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:03,340
Sure is! He's a lock to win both the team tournament and his second individual title!

200
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,730
S-So he's in the same weight class as Hanazono-san?</i>

201
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,140
I will win, win, and win it all!

202
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,270
Then I, Hanazono Kaoru, will show myself to you!

203
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,370
He'll have to win, win, and win it all against that guy!</i>

204
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,280

You're Ito Fujiko, correct?

00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,760
Yes.


211
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,220
You're just as tall as advertised!

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm a fan. Can I have your autograph?

My autograph?

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,800
I-I can't!

215
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,610
Come on. Just sign the back of my pamphlet!

216
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,850
O-Okay.

218
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,420
Um, have you seen all the matches?

219
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,420
Yeah, since this morning.

220
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,760
Is Ebitendo College winning their matches?

221
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,870
Ebiten...

222
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Ah, they're going nowhere!

223
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,770
If I remember, they lost 4-1 against Shida University. They never stood a chance.

224
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,810
Is this Inokuma? It's me, Hanazono.

225
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,600
Huh? You won?!

226
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,270
Congratulations, Hanazono-kun!

227
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,270
But the Ebitendo team lost? I see.

228
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,780
So what about Fujiko-san?

229
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,420
S-Sorry, I haven't seen her yet.



230
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,230
She's probably not coming.

231
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,790
Um, I don't feel too good. Can I go home early?

232
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,540
Yes. I'll just have to fight it out at tomorrow's individuals.

233
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,790
I'll be back for more training.

234
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm still going to do it! I'll see you later.

235
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,260
Where did Fujiko-san go?

236
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,460
Hanazono-san... if you lose tomorrow too, what'll... what'll happen to us?</i>

237

Hi, this is Ito.

238
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,700
Ah, Fujiko-san—

239
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,650
I'm not available right now.

240
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,740
Please leave your message at the tone.

241
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,790
She's not home?
Please leave your message at the tone.

242
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,100
It's me, Yawara!

243
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,860
I've tried calling several times,

244
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,980
so please call back when you get home!

245
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Hanazono-kun did an amazing Harai Goshi and gave his team their only victory today!

246
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,680
I'm sure he'll win in tomorrow's individuals.

247
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,010
Let's meet tomorrow at the arena!

Sign: Inokuma#

249
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,600
Inokuma-san, do you know about today's match?



250
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,490
How badly did Hanazono-san lose?

251
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,150
I'm too scared to ask!

252
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,460
You're still relying on your brute strength, King Kong!

253
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
It's all in the positioning!

254
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,960
Right!

255
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,300
Good! Before we go, I'll share a secret with you that I've been hoarding.

256
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,970
A secret?

257
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,970
"I'm hungry."

258
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,700
When I was living from hand-to-mouth during the war,

259
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,680
I made use of this secret while tossing powerful men on their backs.

260
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,900
I'm! Hun! Gree!

261
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,900
It's the same as Fujiko-san's "Un, deux, trois," right?

262
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,220
That's right!

263
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,950
Once you get in position,

264
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,160
you yell out something to get your timing down, and then make your move!

265
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,870
For example, there's "Hoi! Koh! Row!" or "Ha! Poh! Sai!" or "Ban! Ban! Gee!"

266
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,380
But in your case, "I love you!" would prolly work!

267
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
Huh?

268
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,250
Dummy! That was a joke!





269
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,880
This ends our training!

270
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,020
Thank you very much, Master!

271
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,600
The training you gave me these past few months will not be wasted, not on my life!

272
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,430
There's no need to thank me!

273
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:33,110
Thanks to this gorilla, that stupid office girl has been training like the dickens!</i>

274
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,660
All right!

275
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,120
Watch me tomorrow, Fujiko-san!

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,120
I can't! I can't do it! I'm too scared to listen to any messages!

277
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,790
If he loses tomorrow, what'll happen to us?!




278
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,030
You screwup! That was only the first round!

279
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,440
Minami also lost early in the 71kg-and-unders!

280
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,660
If this keeps up, we'll be packing our bags and leaving before noon!

281
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,540
Sorry.

282
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,000
Masuta! You're up!

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Huh? Fujiko-san hasn't come yet?

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,590
No. She said she felt bad yesterday.

285
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,450
She hasn't called since she went home.

286
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,260
Yesterday? So she came to the team competition yesterday?

287
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,120
Well, she did, but she left without seeing any of the matches.

288
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,040
I wonder what's the matter with her?

289
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,930
What happened, Fujiko-san?</i>

290
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,130
E-Et tu, Masuta?

291
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,680
Th-That means <i>he's</i> the only one left.

292
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,990

Hanazono?

323
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,420
Why would Hanazono make the front page of a newspaper?

324
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,460
"Who is his famous Coach X?"

325
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,380

Where'd he come from?

329
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,100
You? You're saying you're the "famous Coach X"?

330
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,270
Yup, that'd be me!

331
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,530
That's not all. Inokuma Yawara also helped him train.



332
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,530
They've been working for months without missing a day.

Hello?

347
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,460
I'm not available right now.

Please leave your message...

349
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,160
Where did you go? Hanazono-kun's second match is about to begin!



350
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,740
You big lug!

351
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,160
You were bluffing the whole time!

352
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,160
So you weren't messing around with girls!

353
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,910
Did you see that, Fujiko-san?

Fujiko-san, what happened?

360
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,740
Hanazono-kun made it all the way to the semifinals!

361
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,990
Yeah, but he's facing a 2-meter, 180-kg bruiser who's two sizes bigger than him!

362
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,950
Don't worry. You'll definitely win, Hanazono-kun!

363
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,960
You've practiced so much for so long! Keep it up for Fujiko-san!

364
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,300
We've come to the big climax! Yawara!

365
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:24,750
