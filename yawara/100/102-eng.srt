1
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,630
You have to play judo!

2
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,990
You can't be here working!

3
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,730
Your flight to Tokyo leaves at 8:20! I've already made the reservations!

4
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,450
Matsuda will be waiting at Haneda!

5
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,210
Matsuda-san?

6
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,280
Let's go!

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,050
Okay!

8
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,900
If she's late because of you and loses by default, Matsuda,

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,390
you'll get an Okuri Eri Jime and a Sankaku Jime, followed by an Ude Hishigi Jyujigatame!

10
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,400
<b>Run! To the All-Japan Championships!!</b>

11
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,440
Hang on tight!

12
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,340
Okay!




13
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,880
B-But... at least drive a bit more safely!

14
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,480
Dammit! The opening ceremony must've started!

15
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,090
Eh?

16
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,550
We won't make it at this rate!

Sign: Martial Arts Hall#

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,570
This, the fifth All-Japan Women's Judo Championship Tournament,

19
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,280
is finally about to begin!

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,610
Who will end up standing atop the world of Japanese women's judo?

21
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,960
Inokuma-san is working hard at her job.</i>

22
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,960
That means I'll have to...</i>

23
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,580
R-Right.

24
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,750
Who will be the champion of this tournament?



25
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,250
Will it be Ito Fujiko, who almost won a medal after putting up a great showing

26
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,700
at last year's World Judo Championships?

27
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,260
Or will it be Tohdoh Yuki, the veteran and longtime pillar of women's judo?

28
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,270
Or will it be the one appearing again before her fans

29
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,230
after an absence of many months, Honami Sayaka?

30
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,600
What do you think, color commentator Saito-san?

31
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,190
Well, I'd bet the farm on...

32
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,470
Huh?

33
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,150
...the farm on... huh?

34
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,590
What?

35
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,620
Wh-What is it, Saito-san?

36
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,080
This is strange.

37
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,580
What's happening?

38
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,090
We're airing this at two, so cut out this part.

39
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,680
What's going on?

40
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,600
She's not here.

41
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,140
Where is she?

42
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,640
What is Inokuma Yawara doing?

43
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,070
What?

44
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,550
Where's Inokuma?

45
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,900
Inokuma's not here!

46
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,480
Aren't they all supposed to stand in line?

47
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,540
You're right. Inokuma's not here!

48
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,990
See?



49
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,120
Inokuma Yawara is not here for the opening ceremony!

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,190
Send her out!

54
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,950
Damn you, Matsuda! Get her here quick, willya?

55
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,290
That lousy attention monger!

56
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,810
She plans to come out any second to thunderous cheers!

57
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,110
Send out Inokuma!

58
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,350
Where's Inokuma?!

59
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,350
Send her out now!

60
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,340
I-I did it!

61
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,650
Yawara-san must be in Hokkaido now.

62
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,180
No matter how strong Sayaka-san has become, she can't win without Yawara-san.

63
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,500
Her wedding plans are toast! 
You're a free man, Shinnosuke!

64
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,180
Where on Earth do you think Inokuma is, Saito-san?

65
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,340
Maybe she's so nervous she had to use the restroom?

66
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,360
...the fact that we're having this tournament is a great pleasure to everyone concerned.

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,030
Director, cut that part out!

This is getting out of hand. What'll we do?

74
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,440
This doesn't make us look good as sponsors.

75
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,890
We busted our humps getting the sponsorship for this event.

76
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,950

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,960
That was the address from the Director of the tournament, Mr. Yutenji Gozo.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,090
You boob!

84
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,800
Couldn't you have given a longer address? It shoulda been an hour!

85
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,140
B-But!

86
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,770
Fine, I'll just show 'em my stuff for two hours.

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,890
M-Master!
Fine, I'll just show 'em my stuff for two hours.

88
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,980
Regrettable as it is, that's not in the program!

89
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,950
Lemme go, Yutenji!

90
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,660
I see you're going for a power drive!

91
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,870
Nice shot!

92
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,290
How's your game, if I may ask?

93
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,140
Real shaky!

94
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,420
Y-You have no need to worry!

95
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,570
The match is still young, believe me.

96
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,790
They're all whispering among themselves as they play!

97
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,390
All because Inokuma Yawara was snatched away from them!

98
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,400
I fed them a line that she'd return soon,

99
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,940
only because I was too afraid to tell them she'd actually gone back!

100
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,330
But once they find out, our negotiations will be ruined! Thanks to a certain someone!

101
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,230
God!

102
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,330
Honey.

103
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,580
Please give up on Katsuo's private school education and a new house.

104
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,540
I'm going to be fired.

105
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,360
Please, at least let Inokuma-kun succeed!

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,870
God! Damn this traffic!

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,590
Matsuda-san?

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,490
I was wrong about you!

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,950
I never knew your work excited people so much!

110
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,160
What? I can't hear you at all!

111
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,230
<i>All Sports News</i> is the only thing I look forward to anymore.

112
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,730
It's thanks to Matsuda. Practically no one else writes with such gusto!



113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,430
Matsuda-san, I...

114
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,350
Hang on tight!

115
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,970

She would rather lose by default than suffer her first loss at my hands.

O-Oh, I see now! How right you are! Yes, indeed!

122
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,540
L-Leaving that aside, Sayaka-san, are you ready for your first match?

123
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,900
I don't need to fight in the first round.

124
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,200
A top seeded player like me will obviously get a bye!

125
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,440

You don't mean that!

131
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,100
H-However, Yawara-san's match is the last one in the A block.

132
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,370
That's our only thread of hope.

133
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,920
Damn you, Matsuda!

134
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,960
If you're late, you're getting a Hadaka Jime <i>and</i> a Jigoku Zeme!

135
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,460
But what if...

136
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,110
What if he doesn't make it on time?

137
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,500
Then he'll get my Hadaka Jime!

138
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,050
Th-That's not what I meant!

139
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,140
Yawara-san's winning streak will end with a loss by default!

140
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,890
Matsuda! Hurry up, willya?!

141
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,950
Here we go!







142
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,410
Here comes the star player for this first round!

143
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,120
She was suddenly entered into the open-weight division of the World Championships,

144
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,660
where she unexpectedly made a strong showing. It's Ito Fujiko!

145
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,890
I have no choice but to do this!</i>

146
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,780
If Inokuma-san is getting an Ippon at work, then I'll...</i>

147
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,380
Facing her is one of the twins from Kuroyuri Women's College, Ohtawara the elder!

148
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,870
Come forward!

149
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,990
I-I'm not going to lose!
 Inokuma-san, I'll do my best!</i>





150
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,020
What? Yawara's playing sooner than thought?

151
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,610
Yes. B block had several Ippons.
 That's moving things along quickly!

152
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,150
What are you saying?

153
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,650
The B block only has Beanpole.
 It has nothing to do with Yawara!

154
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,160
Actually, it does!

155
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,130
If the first round in the B Block ends quickly,

156
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,700
then the remaining A Block matches are played in the B ring!

157
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,010

158
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,090
Dang!

159
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,930
Beanpole's at the top of her form!
 She's gonna get an Ippon real quick!

160
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,810
Then Yawara-san's match will start even sooner!

161
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,690
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

162
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,700
Un! Deux! Trois!

163
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,570
It's Ito Fujiko with her Ouchi Gari!
Un! Deux! Trois!

164
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,120
Wait!

165
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,470
Oh, but Ohtawara comes back with a Harai Goshi!

166
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,460

It's a Waza Ari!

170
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,850
Ito suffers an early Waza Ari!

171
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,430
But something's strange.

172
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,860
The Ouchi Gari that Ito attempted was perfectly timed.

173
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,840
Mate!

174
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,340
She's really strong!</i>

175
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,370
Beanpole!

176
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,380
Master!

177
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,950
That opponent of yours is a real bruiser!

178
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,380
If I hadn't said anything to you, she'da got an Ippon!

179
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,110
Listen! You're gonna play the match like I tell ya!

180
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,890
Do that, and you're guaranteed a win!

181
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,830
You hear me?!

182
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,890
Yes, sir!

183
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,200
Master is giving me advice.</i>

184
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,900
I'm sure to win!</i>

185
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,910
Master, are you making Ito stall for time?

186
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,700
Hajime!

187
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,200
Master, that's too risky!

188
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,890
If we mess up, not only will Yawara-san lose by default,

189
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,690
Ito will be eliminated in the first round!

190
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,750
Now!

191
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,000
Un!

192
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,440
Deux!

193
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,900
Ito goes for another Ouchi Gari!
Deux!

194
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,010
Ito goes for another Ouchi Gari!

195
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,340
Oh, no! This one's too early!

196
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,310
Ohtawara does a Tomoe Nage!

197
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,870
A Tomoe Nage Ippon!

198
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,320
Ito Fujiko is finished!

199
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,820
Jougai! Mate!

200
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,610
No, it's a Jougai!

201
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,820
Ito Fujiko narrowly escapes by going out of bounds!

202
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,830
That was close!

203
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,830
I knew that was gonna happen.

204
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,120
S-So you knew she would go out of bounds?

205
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,340
You'd better believe it!

206
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,340
Hasn't that little attention strumpet shown herself yet?

207
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,160
Indeed she hasn't, Miss.

208
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,830
So you did run from a fight, Inokuma Yawara!

209
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,560
Now!

210
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,570
Jougai! Mate!

211
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,570
Another Jougai! Ito is saved again by a Jougai!

212
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,320
Ito is still down a Waza Ari! This isn't good!

213
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,450
And time is running out!

214
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,290
Why? I'm following Master Jigoro. Why can't I win?</i>

215
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,330
I'm leaving!

216
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,790
If Inokuma Yawara fears me so much that she's avoiding me,

217
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,350
then I couldn't care less about this tournament!

218
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,860
Tokunaga, I'm changing!

219
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,300
Yes, ma'am!

220
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,190
What a great idea, Sayaka-san! Let's all go home, okay?

221
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,750
We'll grab lunch at a five star restaurant on our way!

222
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,970
All right!</i>

223
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,310
With her wedding plans on hold, you're a free man, Shinnosuke!</i>

224
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:51,010
I can't believe I poured my heart and soul into challenging a girl who fled in the end.

225
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,800
How foolish of me.

226
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
Kazamatsuri-san?

227
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,080
What do you wish to eat?

228
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,580
We will no longer give that shirker any more attention.

229
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,170
The challenge has been decided!








230
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,590
Let's prepare for our nuptials!

231
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,860
That's enough, Master! Please give her some sound advice!

232
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,640
Not yet!

233
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,640
What's going on with Ito?

234
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,350
All the moves she made in this match have been countered!

235
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,230
Now there are only seconds left!

236
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,820
Only seven seconds left!

237
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,080
Six!

238
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,900
Five!

239
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,240
Four!

240
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
Three!

241
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,000
Now!

242
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,840
Un! Deux! Trois!

243
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,300
Ippon!

244
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,030
What an incredible comeback!

245
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,310
You really showed us something, Ito Fujiko!

246
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,540
An Ippon at the last possible second!

247
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,270
I-I won!

248
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,280
Look! We bought a little time.

249
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,740
Beanpole really worked her rear off out there.

250
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,120
If that dingbat's late, she's really gonna get it!

251
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,120
Prepare for our nuptials.

252
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,620
Our nuptials.

253
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,650
Nuptials.

254
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,170
Let's prepare for our nuptials.

255
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,670
Tokunaga, I'm changing.

256
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,230
Th-This is bad!</i>

257
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,640
I gotta do something! Come on, think! Think of something good!</i>

258
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,100
W-Wait!

259
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,110
What's the matter with you, Kazamatsuri-san? We need to leave!

260
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,110
N-No, wait a minute, Sayaka-san!
 You're forgetting something important!

261
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,610
Something important?

262
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,020
Th-That's right!



263
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,620
You've forgotten about your match in the Ajisai Cup women's tournament!

264
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,830
Didn't you tie with someone back then?

265
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,080
Don't you want revenge for that humiliation?

266
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,510
It has to be Ito Fujiko.</i>

267
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,070
I have no choice but to place all my bets on her!</i>

268
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,340
If by some small miracle she manages to beat Sayaka-san, she'll become a second rival,</i>

269
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,050
and Sayaka-san will continue with her judo!</i>

270
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,100
That lanky girl is not a worthy opponent for me.

271
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,840
B-But she's <i>the</i> Master Jigoro's prized pupil!

272
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,060
Kazamatsuri-san?
B-But she's <i>the</i> Master Jigoro's prized pupil!

273
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,560
Yes?

274
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:37,080
It appears you do not understand the type of excruciating mountain training I suffered

275
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,570
at the hands of Inokuma Kojiro.

276
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,900
I am now so strong that I frighten even myself.

277
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,650
Tokunaga?

278
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,410
Yes?

279
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,340
Your match!

280
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,790
Inokuma-san is coming?!

281
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,440
But she has work today.

282
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,260
No! She's still a judoka,

283
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,790
so she'd rather have a match with you than work!

284
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,630
A match... with me?

285
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,310
Take these, and wait at the entrance!

286
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,190
Yes, sir!

287
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,360
And don't take her to no dressing room! Make her change outside!

288
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,780
Yes, sir!

289
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,830
Ippon!

290
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,660
You morons! Take more time, dang it!

291
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,670
There are only two more matches left!

292
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,060
She'd rather have a match with you.

293
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,780
Inokuma-san...

294
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,310
Hurry up, Inokuma-san!

295
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,820
Ippon!

296
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,170
Where's Inokuma?

297
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,730
She's still not here.

298
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,330
Really?


299
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,570
All according to plan!

300
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,090
A win by default is still a win!

301
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,500
Tsukushi U will finally defeat Inokuma Yawara!

302
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,870
But I still want to play her in a real—

303
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,370
A real match will end in a real loss!

304
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,750
A win by default is good enough, you hear?

305
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,510
Where's Inokuma?

306
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,590
Still not here!

307
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,100
Her match is about to start!

308
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,780
Now we will conduct the eighth first-round match in Block A.
Her match is about to start!

309
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,760
Now we will conduct the eighth first-round match in Block A.

310
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,910
Inokuma-san, hurry!

311
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,770
In red, Inokuma Yawara, 2-dan.
Inokuma-san, hurry!

312
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,230
In red, Inokuma Yawara, 2-dan.

313
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,330
No, don't start now!
In red, Inokuma Yawara, 2-dan.

314
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:31,660
No, don't start now!

315
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,770
In white, Katori Shinobu, 2-dan.
No, don't start now!

316
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,550
In white, Katori Shinobu, 2-dan.

317
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,890
It's over! Yawara-san has lost her first match!
In white, Katori Shinobu, 2-dan.

318
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,290
It's over! Yawara-san has lost her first match!

319
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,280
That dingbat and her half-wit reporter!

320
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,600
Go on! Go and get that win! Come on!

321
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,280
Yes, sir!

322
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,510
It's finally come to Inokuma Yawara's match.

323
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,250
But what's this? The referees seem to be having a discussion.

324
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,070
Saito-san, we don't see Inokuma Yawara anywhere.

325
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,310
Indeed.

326
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,750
Who'd have thought her undefeated streak would end this way?

327
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,330
The referees are on the mat.

328
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,470
It's over.

329
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,260
No! She can't lose this way!

330
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,410
Inokuma-san! You can't lose!

331
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,520
Inokuma-san...

332
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,290
You're going to...

333
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,210
Inokuma-san!

334
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,850
Fujiko-san!

335
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,190
Matsuda-san!

336
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,650
Inokuma-san! Hurry!

337
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,660
H-Hurry up! Go!

338
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,660
Her opponent, Katori, is the only one entering the ring!

339
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,710
The arena is awash with angry bellows and calls for Inokuma!

340
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,920
Will Inokuma Yawara lose by default?!

341
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,080
Excuse us! Let us though!

342
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,220
Make way! Please!

343
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,040
Is this the end of her undefeated record?!

344
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,530
Chief Referee! Wait!
Is this the end of her undefeated record?!

345
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,840
Chief Referee! Wait!

346
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,890
There's Inokuma!

347
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,850
That dingbat?!

348
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,010
Inokuma's here!

349
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,810
She... She just barely made it to her match. Will she be all right?

350
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,820
Forgive my lateness!

351
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,780
Hajime!

352
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,740
Sayaka-san, can't you at least try playing against Ito Fujiko?

353
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,380
Even Inokuma Yawara is no longer a worthy opponent,

354
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,790
yet I must fight that utter newcomer?

355
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,800
N-No, I'm saying that since you're here and all, a little exercise wouldn't hurt.

356
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,250
Tokunaga, we will order a wedding dress along the way.

357
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,340
Understood.

358
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,800
S-Sayaka... san?

359
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,120
That's Inokuma!

360
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,900
She got a quick Ippon Zeoi!

361
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,440
Yawara-san?

362
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,910
Tokunaga! Get my judo gi!

363
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,070
She made it!

364
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,890

365
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,920
Yawara! You bubbleheaded Ginny-come-lately!

366
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,590
I'm gonna punish you like you ain't never seen!

367
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,580
Thank goodness I made it in one piece!

368
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,360
Riding in back on Matsuda-san's bike nearly cost me my life!

369
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
By the way, Yawara, I dunno who coached her,

370
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,140
but that heiress is in rare form today.

371
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,580
I can't wait to see you two fight!

372
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,100
Yawara!

373
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,750
Sayaka Surges Ahead!

374
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,050
You'll be getting my Hadaka Jime if you don't watch!
