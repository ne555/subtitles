1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,600
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,900
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,400
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,600
What? Let me go!

10
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,700
Everyone, we have all our members now. She is a member of our Musashiyama High Judo Club.

11
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,200
Don't belittle us! You expect us to fight a girl?

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,700
I know it's a bit unreasonable. 
And in addition, I'd like to request 
to change the format of the match.

13
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,000
The match format?

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,300
Instead of the game, pointman vs. pointman, captain vs. captain...

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I'd like to make it kachinukisen. Please!
[kachinukisen--single elimination to the top]

16

Hanazono-kun!

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Inokuma, I beg you. I'll make you the captain!

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Captain?

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,700
I'll be the vice captain and you 
won't ever have to you fight.

20
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,100
What are you talking about? 
I need to go to the bargain sale...

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,300
Wait a minute. A girl. A girl!

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,100
We can legally tackle a girl!

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,900
If it's a kachinukisen, then everyone
has a chance to touch a girl!

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
I get to touch a girl!

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Please, Inokuma!

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,300
Hanazono, we'll give you a samurai's generosity. We'll accept all your terms.

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Right, everyone?

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,700
Y... yeah!

29
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,800
Really? How grateful!

30
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,500
Now just a minute! Why do I 
have to be in the match?

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,100
We'll win all the way so 
you won't have to fight.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Please, Inokuma!

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,700
Hanazono-kun...

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I really need to go to Shibuya...

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,900
Get this over quickly, okay?

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Ahh, it'll end quickly. Just leave it to me.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,700
Grandpa!

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,800
Why, why is he here?

39

Yawara! Episode 5
Finally the Real Fight! The Path of 
Judo Is Not Paved In One Day, Jya!

40

N... newaza it is!
[Newaza--groundwork]

that no one lays a finger on you.

47
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Inokuma, don't worry. I'll make sure 
that no one lays a finger on you.

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,950
We will begin the practice match between Ganryuji High and Musashiyama High. Bow!

Yes!

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,900
Matsuda-san, it was worth following
her all this time, after all.

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah. This is going to be interesting!

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Both pointman, step forward.

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200

72

How shameful for you to get 
distracted by a girl and lose!

86
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,700
In a man's fight, of course you'd 
lose with such evil thoughts!

Of course not!

about your lust-filled face!

Inokuma, you've done enough. I'm 
very satisfied with just one win!

lose the next one anyway.

must have fallen down by themselves!

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,000
Nope! This is the true ability
of Inokuma Yawara!

160
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,000
Kamoda, did you get that one on camera...

161
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
Oww..

162
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't get it.

163
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,400
I don't get the girl, Inokuma Yawara, even more.

164
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
Why is she so defenseless?

165
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,200
If she is a judo athlete, there should 
have been some kind of response.

166
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,700
Is she really strong?

167
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
I finished the circuit training...

168
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,600
Kazamatsuri Coach!

169
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,500
You're thinking about Inokuma
Yawara again, aren't you?

170
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,500
Yes.

171
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,400
I've seen it...

172
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
You were approaching Yawara for a kiss!

173
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,600
I need to see her one more time to check,

174
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,200
To see if she's as strong as you say she is.

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,300
Oww!

176
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,400
Why did you do that, all of a sudden?

177
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,900
Why... why am I so irritated?

178
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,400
Inokuma Yawara!

179
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,500
Inokuma, great job!

You, are you perhaps related
to that Inokuma Rokudan?





182
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,700
The master?

183
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,100
Oh yeah, it is the same surname!

184
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,500
No wonder she's so strong!

185
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,500
N... no way! That baboon grandpa
has no relation to me whatsoever.

186
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,400
Grmphh! Help! Grunt!

187
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,200
By the way, teacher, what time is it?

188
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,400
Oh uhm, it's 3:15pm, but..

189
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,500
Whoa, the match, the match!

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,900
What should I do? I won't make it
to the bargain sale in time anymore!

191
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,000
Please, teacher, could you 
let me lose by default...

192
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Ganryuji High vice captain, Oomori-kun.

193
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,800
Oomori! I don't think you need to be warned but, don't make her lucky 3 times.

194
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,100
Sasaki, I won't let her get to you.

195
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,100
I'll be the last one to do it with the girl then.

196
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,900
All right. Let's go!

197
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Darnit!

198
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,400
Bow! Begin!

199
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,700
Oh, I was going to buy that one-piece miniskirt,

200
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
... and a jacket, too.

201
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,000
Everyone's probably mad by 
now, since I ditched them...

202
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,000
Hey, look at this one-piece! 
And the price, too!

203
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,700
My next date outfit is set!

204
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,000
But where is Yawara? I called
but she wasn't home.

205
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
Yeah. She was looking forward to this, too.

206
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,000
Th... this is!

207
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,000
No, enough!

208
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,000
All right!

209
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,400
Out of bounds!

210
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,100
Both of you, fix your sash.

211
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,700
What are you doing, idiot!

212
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Do it seriously!

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,800
She's for real.

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
She's really strong.

215
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
You're kidding, right?

216
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Oomori is using everything against her.

217
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,900

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Inokuma, straighten up!

222
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,200
That's unfair, aiming just for her leg!

223
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
Inokuma-san!

224
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,800
That one-piece's probably sold already.

225
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,840
I really, really wanted that, too.

226
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,800
How is it, Yawara? This is a real fight.

227
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,200
If you can't even get over this,
the gold medal and the National 
Achievement Award are unreachable.

228
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,200
I quit already!

229
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Why do I have to be treated 
like this over judo?

230
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,100
Teacher, I can't do this anym...

stand up! I'm very deeply moved!

for in Musahiyama High Judo Club...

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,800
Just throw that jerk!

such a strong opponent before!

Don't get that face near me! 
Let me borrow your ear.

Inokuma, I've got an important 
message for you from the master.

Important message?

279

"That Captain, Sasaki, from 
seeing his randori... 
[Randori--judo sparring]

not good to go against him head on.

So, if you don't do exactly as
I say, you'll surely lose."

Therefore, for you to win,

Therefore, for you to win,

buy that one-piece for me.

buy that one-piece for me.

... so that's it. Got it, Inokuma?

289

With just this taping, the pain
probably won't go away.

But one more, just one more person and 
our judo club can finally win for once!

Just one more, just one more!


298
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,900
Just one more, just one more!
And because of a girl, our 
pace was screwed up!

299
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,100
And because of a girl, our 
pace was screwed up!

300
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,500
We should end this ridiculous
match immediately!

301

Girl, girl! Don't make fun of girls!

302
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,400
Normal girls don't usually fight judo
with guys on a weekend afternoon.

You should be downtown, wearing
pretty clothes and dating!

If I had that choice...

305
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,400
I'd LOVE to do that!

306
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,100
Begin!

307
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,100
That's it, Sasaki!

Inokuma-san really can't use 
her leg strength much.

310
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,700
This is looking bad!

311
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,800
"I never went against such a strong
opponent before", yeah, right!

312
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,500
I just need one finger to
defeat this little girl.

313
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,300
N... no way!

314
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,900
A girl can't possibly hold down a guy!

315
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,470
Her breasts! How soft!

316
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
It's a waste to break from the hold so soon.

317
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,200
Let me savor it a while longer!

318
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
5 seconds past.

319
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,000
What's wrong, Sasaki, hurry
up and break away!

320
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
Hah! Maybe he's doing it on purpose!

321
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,200
Sasaki! You dirty rat!

322
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,800
And you call yourself a captain?!

323
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,100
Don't sweat it!

324
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,300
I guess I should break...

325
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,360
I can't break it!

326
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,600
Sasaki!

327
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,900
What are you doing?

328
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Hurry and break the hold!

329
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,200
20 seconds.

330
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,300
N... no way!

331
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm... I'm the nation's third-best, Sasaki!

332
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Excellent, Yawara!

333
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,400
But the path to the National Achievement Award has only just begun!

334
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
985 days until the Olympics!

335
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,900
Oh no, no...!

336
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,900
I didn't know that Kazamatsuri-san
is Sayaka-san's coach!



337
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,000
Eeei, Yawara!

338
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,900
Who cares about that glitzy guy!

339
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
You're going to have an
earth-shattering debut!

340
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,900
Kazamatsuri-san, I want to
know your true feelings!

341
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,900
Next time on "Yawara!" ...

342

"Finally Pictured! The Big Scoop of the Century That Will Bring On a Storm, Jya!"

343

you one hell of an attack!
