9
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
"I never went against such a strong 
opponent before" yeah, right.

10
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,100
I just need one finger for this girl...

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,920
U... unbelievable!

12
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Her breasts!

13
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,900
How soft! It's a waste to break from the hold just yet, let me savor it a while longer.

14
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,800
What's wrong, Sasaki, hurry and break free!

15
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
M... maybe he's doing it on purpose?

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Sasaki! You dirty rat!

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,900
And you call yourself a captain?

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
Don't sweat it. I guess I should break...

19
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,100
I... I can't break loose!



20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,700
Yawara! Episode 6
Finally pictured! The Big Scoop of the Century That Will Bring On a Storm, Jya!!

21
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,400
Thi... this can't be!

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,900
I can't be pinned down by a little girl!

23
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm the nation's third-best, Sasaki!

24
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,000
10 seconds.

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,600
Sasaki!

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Why, why can't I break loose?

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
It's as if a large rock is on me.

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,700
I've done judo for 10 years now.

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,300
If I stay pinned by a girl like her, 
then what was my 10 years for?

30
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,500
15 seconds.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
There's no use in looking at the time.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,300
The holding techniques that I've taught
her won't be broken by some luck.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,300
You can't even break loose even after an hour!

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,100
The teacher's instruction?

35
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,400
20 seconds.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,300
10 more seconds.

37
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,050
9 seconds.

38
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,000
8 seconds.

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,600
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,800
Ippon!
[Ippon--Full 10 points, a win]

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,700
Musashiyama High team victory!

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
It's finally over.

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
All right! We won! Time to
group-toss the victor!

44
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,100
Hold it!

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Hold off on the group-toss... for now.

46
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,800
All of you have probably guessed 
by now, this is my granddaughter.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,100
Grandpa!

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
I thought so.

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,000
Ever since she was little, my 
Yawara personally learned my 
judo and is a judo genius.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,800
And so, Sasaki Captain, there's no 
need to suffer from this loss.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,100
Y... yes sir.

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,800
I, the 5-time national champ and 8th
degree black belt, have personally 
trained her for all these years.

53
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,400
A 10-year punk like you can't possibly
be on the same level as her!

54
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Y... yes.

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,000
By the way, I'd like today's 
match to be our secret.

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,600
A secret?

57
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,800
You Ganryuji kids wouldn't like the rumor
of losing to a girl to be spread, right?

58
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,000
T... true.

59
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,100
You Musashiyama kids would benefit
from pretending to have won with
your own powers, right?

60
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,300
Wh... why so?

61
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:53,600
Inokuma sacrificed her leg to fight on for us, didn't go to the bargain sale she wanted 
to go to, and brought victory to us!

62
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah, why do we have to keep 
such a great story under wraps?

63
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,800
Rather, we should hail Inokuma-san's
great accomplishment!

64
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,400
You can take this great
accomplishment and shove it!

65
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,600
Get this... This girl will have an ultimate accomplishment of getting...

66
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,600
...the Olympic gold medal and the National Achievement Award waiting for her!

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,600
G... gold medal... Olympics...

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,300
In the near future, Yawara will have
a sensational debut, so this was 
just her practice round.

69
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,900
So, no need for a group-toss for
a practice round. Okay?

70
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,900
And so, please keep today's
incident just between us.

71
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, excuse us.

72
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,900
Even so, she's too strong.

73
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,300
Yeah. Gold medal and the National Achievement Award..

74
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,400
It's not an unreachable 
dream... for her, that is.

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Inokuma.

76
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,100
I'm okay, so let me down.

77
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,500
Your leg is precious, don't strain it.

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,400
I'll put my special medicine
on it when we get home.

79
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,100
It it's that crushed up viper 
stuff, I don't want it.

80
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,500
Well now, the real match was
pretty tough, wasn't it?

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Because of it, I had to ditch my 
friends at the bargain sale!

82
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,000
But, the real judo is nothing like that.

83
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,530
That kind of judo was no fun at all.

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:36,830
JUDO

85
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,500
JUDO
One day, there'll come a time for you
to go against that Hon'ami Sayaka.

86
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,700
JUDO

87
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
JUDO
You and that girl will make the 
future of judo very interesting!

88
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,700
You and that girl will make the 
future of judo very interesting!

89
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,500
On the contrary, that will be no fun at all!

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Anyway, how could you have
pulled me into today's match?

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,100
Ah, well...

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,800
What's wrong?

93
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,400
I completely forgot about those
three in the storage room!

94
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,900
Someone! Someone!

95
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,850
Kazamatsuri-san, could I come to
your room next time?

96
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,100
I'll be waiting for your call.

97
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Shinnosuke-sama, this is Yoko.

98
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,100
If you don't call me soon, I'll die!

99
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,500
This is Minako. I have tickets to the piano concert. On Sunday, let's meet at...

100
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,500
Hi, this is Kazamatsuri, the charming...

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,300
Hi, this is Kazamatsuri, the charming...
Why am I so popular?

102
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Why am I so popular?


103
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh well, no girl so far has made me hot. Right now, I'm only interested in one particular girl.

104
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,400
You're thinking about Inokuma
Yawara, aren't you?

105
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,800
Sa... Sayaka-san!

106
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,500
Whatever you think about is up to you.

107
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,500
But, don't ever forget that you are
Hon'ami Sayaka's coach!

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,400
Understood?

109
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,600
Sayaka-san, then, as your coach, 
I need to check one thing..

110
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,600
Inokuma Yawara's strength.

111
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Grandpa, the phone!

112
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,700
I'm tied up right now. Grandpa!

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Shut up. I'm busy right now.

114
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,270
Darnit.

115
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,100
Yes, this is the Inokuma residence.

116
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Kazamatsuri-san!

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,000
No, I have no plans for...

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes, then... on Sunday!

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,100
All right!

120
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,900
What happened, Yawara,
at yesterday's bargain sale?

121
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,700
Yeah, we waited a long time for you!

122
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, I had something come up...

123
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,100
Yeah sure, it was probably that guy...
on a date... or something!

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,400
Oh wow, Yawara, really?

125
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,000
No, no. We're going to date on Sunday...

126
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,500
Ahh, we heard that!

127
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,100
Ahh, we heard that!
Your boyfriend is so fast and aggressive!

128
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,700
Your boyfriend is so fast and aggressive!

129
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,500
He's not my boyfriend yet...

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
It's not good to be so timid!

131
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, you should be more aggressive, too.

132
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Should I?

133
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,900
What's wrong, Yawara?

134
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
What's up?

135
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,000
Enough already!

136
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,500
H... hi!

137
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,500
Don't say "hi" after following me since morning!


138
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,700
I'll keep following you until
I uncover your secret.

139
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,100
What was that?

140
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,630
It's nothing. Let's go.

141
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Geez, he's so persistent!

142
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Our judo team beat Ganryuji High? Cool!


143
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Is it true, Hanazono?

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
And you won with that sorry lineup?

145
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,100
W... well, yeah.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,100
Uhh, move over...

147
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,900
Hey!

148
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,500
Inokuma!

149
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,600
Ah, Hanazono-kun, good morning.

150
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
U.umm, I bought you this cuz I thought 
it might look good on you.

151
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
And, and, could you umm, 
please read this, too?

152
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,500
And, and, could you umm, 
please read this, too?
envelope -- Inokuma Yawara-sama

153
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,400
envelope -- Inokuma Yawara-sama

154
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,500
Uhh.

155
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,300
Actually, I thought Kazumi bought 
that one-piece for me.

156
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,700
Sorry.

157
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,000
Inokuma.

158
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,900
It's complete!

159
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
This came out to be an excellent piece.

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Yawara's shocking and graceful debut 
plan has gone into Phase 2.

161
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,830
None of these grab me.

162
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Oh, if I went to the bargain sale,
I could've bought a new piece.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,500
Yawara!

164
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
Geez, knock before you come in, Grandpa!

165
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I'll be out today for an important engagement.

166
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,500
I'll probably be late, taken to a settai at 
some restaurant, so plan accordingly.
settai--reception

167
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,900
Okay, whatever.

168
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,000
By the way, why are you trying
to be all dressed up for?

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,300
None of your business.

170
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,900
It better not be a date or something.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,100
I won't allow it! If some flashy chump dirties you, then what will happen with obtaining
the National Achievement Award?

172
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,750
Hurry up and leave already.

173
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,300
It's an important engagement, right?


174
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,800
Hey Yawara! Men are forbidden!

175
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,700
Bleah! Unfortunately, Kazamatsuri-san 
isn't that kind of man!

176
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,200
Ahh, it's already time!

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm going to be late!

178
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Today will be different from last time,
I will uncover Inokuma Yawara's secret.

179
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,900
And, she is late...

180
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,600
Kazamatsuri-san!

181
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,950
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long.

182
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
C... cute!

183
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
N... no, I just got here also.

184
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,700
Shall we go then?

185
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,500
Okay!

186
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,500
This park... is the place we came last time.

187
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Maybe Kazamatsuri-san is
thinking of it again...

188
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,100
That's Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke.

189
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,700
Hon'ami Sayaka's coach is with Yawara-san...

190
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,900
There must be something going on.

191
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,750
Inokuma-san, I wanted to meet with you 
again to relax and talk about things.

192
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,200
M... me too.

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Ever since I met you, I've been thinking about you and I wanted to know more about you.
I'd like you to tell me about yourself.

194
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,550
M... me?

195
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,200
Yes, I want to know everything about you.

196
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,200
U... uhm... Well, I...

197
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,030
Yeah, say it, say your secret.

198
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
Actually I...

199
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,930
Go ahead, say it!

200
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,200
I gained 2 kilos [4.5 lbs.] this month!

201
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,900
Hah?

202
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm trying to be careful, but after school on 
the way home, I stop by for ice cream and...

203
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,250
No, not that kind of story, the other kind!

204
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,100
Other kind?

205
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Yeah, what I want to ask you is your...

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,300
My...?

207
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,100
Your...

208
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,400
Minako!

209
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh yeah, I'm ditching her date!

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Th... this is so nostalgic!
I was a fan of this as a child!

211
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,400
Let's go now, Inokuma-san! Let's go!

212
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,400
Come, come.

213
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,300
Hey, pay for it! Un?

214
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,100
Hmm, so you missed the bargain.

215
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
Uh-huh. I was looking forward to it but...

216
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,500
That was unfortunate.

217
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,500
We can't be talking about this stuff forever.

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,800
Anyway, Inokuma-san, I'd like to hear 
the continuation of the previous story.

219
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,900
You should have something
to tell me. Please talk.

220
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,400
I need to tell you something?

221
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,900
Kazamatsuri-san is trying to check my feelings. Maybe he also feels the same about me as...

222
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,900
Come on, tell me your secret this time!

223
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,700
Okay.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,400
Kazamatsuri-san, I, I think...

225
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Don't cry.

226
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,200
Y... Yoko!


227
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,100
Just forget about that guy. He 
was probably just playing.

228
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,500
Liar! Shinnosuke-sama isn't 
that kind of person!

229
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,800
U... uhm, it's gotten kind of chilly all of a
sudden. Let's hurry back to shore.

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I wouldn't want you to catch
a cold, Inokuma-san.

231
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm not gonna lose you guys!

232
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,100
Matsuda-san! Something's up!

233
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,700
Oww... Hey Kamoda, on top of being
late, what's up with this?

234
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,200
Forget this, the Inokuma Gramps
went to the TV station...

235
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,900
What? Oh damn!

236
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Grandpa, you are persistent!

237
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,150
No matter how stubborn you are, it's no use.


238
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Whoever this genius judo girl is, it would've been better to have her come instead of you

239
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,400
If you agree to do Yawara's special TV program, I'll let you meet my grand-daughter.



240
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,600
Anyway, I want you to read the plan I devised over consecutive all-nighters.

241
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,900
Plan?

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,700
Heh, a 3 hour special? You expect 
us to use 3 hours of slot time?


243
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,630
Even that was trimmed down.

244
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,700
And the first hour block is "This Is 
Inokuma Yawara's Everything, Jya"?

245
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,800
Yes.

246
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
I want Yawara's adorable qualities
appealed to everyone.

247
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,300
And the next hour block is "The Hot Battle! Inokuma Yawara's Shocking Debut Match"?


248
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,300
She'll do a match against one 
of the nation's best three.

249
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,700
The place is the National Martial Arts Hall.

250
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,400
And, what is this last hour block 
"This Is Inokuma Jigoro, Jya" ?


251
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,600
My obstacle-filled life will be captured
through photo clips and reenactments.

252
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,300
The program will end amidst a 
storm of moving emotions.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,900
Have him removed.

254
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,100
Yes, sir.

255
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,800
You're satisfied now, aren't you?

256
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,500
What are you doing, you disrespectful moron!

257
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,750
I'm trying to give you my 
grand-daughter's sensational debut!

258
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm trying to give you my 
grand-daughter's sensational debut!
There he is, Matsuda-san.

259
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,200
There he is, Matsuda-san.

260
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,500
OK. Gimme a hand.

261
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
There you are Grand-dad!

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,600
I'm sorry sir!

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,900
He's senile beyond recognition, 
so just ignore whatever he said.

264
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,400
What? I am NOT senile!

265
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,100
Come on Grandpa, let's go home.

266
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,600
Hey, let go of me, let go of me!

267
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,100
Eiii, what part of "let go of me"
don't you get!

268
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,900
That was close! God knows what would happen if you laid hands on us!


269
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,900
You cowards! If you get in my way 
anymore, I'll have to hurt you!

270
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,600
Yeah, but we're putting our lives on the line 
to get Yawara-san's exclusive scoop!

271
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,200
I won't dare let a TV station swipe it from us!


272
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,600
That's right. We're staying close 
until we get Yawara-san's scoop!

273
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,750
Idiots! I won't let you guys do that!

274
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
Not to a third-rate newspaper like you all!

275
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,000
Inokuma-san, let's have some tea.
I know a good cafe close by.

276
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,100
S... sure.

277
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,700
And, as we drink some hot tea, 
I want to know more about you.

278
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
O... okay.

279
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
This is it. Isn't it nice?

280
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,800
Tokunaga, hurry it up!

281
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,300
Y... yes, ma'am!

282
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,500
Sa... Sayaka-san!

283
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,100
This is not my day!

284
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,000
What's wrong?

285
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,300
Ahh, n... nothing really!

286
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,850
Inokuma-san, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

287
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,850
Let's meet again real soon. Goodbye!

288
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,300
Kazamatsuri-san. Kazamatsuri-san.

289
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,900
Please wait, ma'am!

290
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,700
Kazamatsuri-san asked for my feeling 
so persistently, but I couldn't 
even say the word "like"...

291
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,500
"Let's meet again real soon. Goodbye!"

292
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,500
Oh well, I can try again real soon!

293
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Huh? Grandpa?

294
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,100
You're back early. Weren't you supposed to 
be at a restaurant settai or something?
settai--reception

295
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
It didn't happen.

296
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
I went to the Oshiuri TV station but...

297
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,900
No way, a TV station? Did you 
meet anyone famous?

298
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,300
I met and talked with Sugimura Haruko-san 
and Takamine Mieko-san.

299
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
They were more beautiful 
in person than on TV.

300
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Did you see Shonentai and Hikaru Genji?

301
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,900
I've no interest in school-boy groups.

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,700
By the way, why did you go to the 
TV station in the first place?

303
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
Promoting you, of course.

304
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,000
What? Promoting me?

305
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,500
The best way to glamorously promote 
your debut is through the TV, so...

306
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,000
I can't believe it!

307
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,400
But, Oshiuri TV rejected it. How could
they refuse such juicy material!

308
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,000
Of course not!

309
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,900
Please don't do such stupid things anymore!

310
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,900
I have no intention of entering the judo world.


311
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm finally able to be like a normal girl and...

312
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,100
"A normal girl..." and what, hook a guy?

313
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,700
gulp!

314
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Remember, Yawara, that in any world, idols don't get careless and make boyfriends.

315
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,300
Getting the National Achievement
Award means that you'll be the 
idol for all Japanese citizens.

316
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,700
And so, an idol like that can't possibly 
have a boyfriend get in the way.

317
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,900
I don't want to be everyone's girl,
I just need to be one man's girl.

318
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,800
No more! I'm never going to do judo... ever!


319
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,800
Yawara, in you body flow the 
blood of a judo athlete...

320
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,600
You can't quit, even if you try.

321
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,300
Hmph, who cares about the blood 
of a judo athlete. Not fair!

322
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,600
I was forced to do judo ever 
since I could remember.

323
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,000
Who's there?

324
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,800
You're that newspaper reporter 
again, aren't you!

325
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,700
Okay, that's it! How dare you come
invade my house and peep!

326
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,600
What's happening, Yawara?

327
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,400
A peeping tom! He was spying on our dojo!

328
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,100
You thug!

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,300
Ka... Kazamatsuri-san!

330
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,400
There's another one there!

331
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,200
Show yourselves!

332
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,300
Ta-dahh! The Daily Every Sports' Matsuda Kosaku has finally captured the decisive scene!

333
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,100
I got great shots, Matsuda-san!


334
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,200
And, to throw Hon'ami Sayaka's coach 
and pin him with an arm-crushing cross 
body lock, an overwhelming scoop!

335
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Sayaka-san's coach?

336
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,300
Kazamatsuri-san is...?

337
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,200
Well then! Please look forward to 
tomorrow's The Daily Every Sports!

338
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,600
Wait, you're not getting away with this!

339
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,100
I didn't mean to hide it from you. I didn't approach you for spying, either.

340
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,800
Well, I'll see you...


341
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What fast, sneaky slimeballs!

342
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,300
I must somehow get them 
and tear them to pieces!

343
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,400
All right!

344
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,200
We finally did it, huh, Matsuda-san!

345
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,400
Yeah, sure did! From this one picture,
Japan's superstar is born!

346
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,100
You better see tomorrow's Daily Every Sports!

347
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,900
Kazamatsuri-san is Sayaka-san's coach?

348
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,300
Kazamatsuri-san is...?

349
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:23,100
978 days to the Barcelona Olympics!


350
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Geez, everything is screwed up!

351
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,100
Because of that newspaper reporter, 
Matsuda, my identity is revealed!

352
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,200
Yawara-san, you need to be 
Japan's shining star!

353
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,800
A superstar!

354
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,500
Please, leave me alone!

355
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
Next time, on "Yawara!"...

356
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,900
Hohohoh! The Yawara Boom 
That Shakes Japan, Jya!

357
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,100
Please watch it, okay?

358
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,800
A second helping of tofu-miso soup, please!
