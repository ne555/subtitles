Wh... wh... wh... what's that?

10
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,300
What's up? What is it?

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,100
Oh yeah...

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Last night, I let Yawara-san sleep
inside, while I stayed outside.

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,300
But what's going on so early in the morning?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh, morning practice!

15
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,800
She's been doing it every morning
for 10 years, no doubt.

16
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,800
Even though she claims to dislike judo, 
she can't shake off that daily habit.

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,100
Wha... don't answer it, don't...!

18
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,540
Yes, this is the Matsuda residence.

19
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,300
Matsuda-san, are you up?

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,400
Yeah...

21
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
You have a phone call...

22
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,400
From the editor-in-chief.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Th... this is Matsuda.

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
You big fat idiot!

25
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,300
What are doing at a time like this! Why
are you fooling around with a girl?!

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
W... well... actually, uhm...

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,100
I've got a cold... and my little 
sister came to take care of me...

28
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,900
I don't care about your excuses!

29
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,400
Last night, the Hon'ami family invited Inokuma Jigoro and held a private meeting!

30
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,200
Hah?

31
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Inokuma Yawara is missing, too! 
Despite you chasing her all this time, 
why'd she slip through your fingers?!

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,100
Umm, what did you say 
about Inokuma Jigoro?

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Grandpa?

34
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,400
Look at the TV!

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,700
TV?

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The switch, the switch!

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,530
As for the details of the private meeting,
the Hon'ami family has no comments.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
But, according to inside sources,
the Hon'ami family was apparently
trying to hire 7th degree black belt...

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,600
But, according to inside sources,
the Hon'ami family was apparently
trying to hire 7th degree black belt...
G... Grandpa!

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
G... Grandpa!
..Inokuma Jigoro, also the legal guardian of Inokuma Yawara, as their personal coach.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,100
..Inokuma Jigoro, also the legal guardian of Inokuma Yawara, as their personal coach.

42
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,500
Knowing the fact that he raised
her rival, Inokuma Yawara...

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
Knowing the fact that he raised
her rival, Inokuma Yawara...
Grandpa... Grandpa is..?

44
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,400
...it is a rather bold move for Hon'ami Sayaka.

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:03,700
How is Inokuma Yawara 
going to handle this news?

46
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,000
How is Inokuma Yawara 
going to handle this news?
Grandpa is Sayaka-san's coach?

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,680
How is Inokuma Yawara 
going to handle this news?

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:16,200
Yawara Episode 8
Enough of Judo! I'm 
Going To Be In a Match!

49
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,230
Inokuma-san, open up!

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,900
Just one comment, please!

51
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,900
What happened at last night's dinner meeting?

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,200
Are you really going to be 
Hon'ami Sayaka's coach?

53
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Eii! That delinquent girl!

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,500
How dare she stay out without my 
permission! I'm going to give her the 
lecture of her life when she gets back!

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,300
But, that meal at last night's
French restaurant...

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Umm, Inokuma-sensei, what do you think?

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,300
This is truly delicious!

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:04,430
N... no, not the food. I was referring to
what we've been requesting of you.. 
to take over as Sayaka's coach.

59
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,700
Of course, if you agree, I can 
arrange for an ample bonus.

60
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,600
And that's not all.

61
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,000
We'll even offer total support
to Yawara-san's debut.

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
The place of event is the 
martial arts hall-size!

63
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,200
We'll bring over top level world-class 
athletes and conduct a very 
splashy debut as you wished.

64
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,500
I have one question.

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
Sure! Please ask!

66
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,000
Can I have this food in a doggy bag?

67
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,600
F... father... wh... what is a doggy bag?

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,200
This French food is truly delicious!

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Wh... what a grand person!

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,300
Eii! That delinquent girl!

71
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,700
I brought that good food for her, too!

72
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,700
Where in the world did she go?

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Grandpa is going to be Sayaka-san's coach?

74
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm finally... alone, aren't I?

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,800
Come on, cheer up!

76
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,350
Oh hey, we should go out somewhere for fun!

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,000
Eh?

78
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,700
You just need to let loose 
sometimes! Just have fun!

79
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,400
Now that that's settled, seconds, please!

80
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,400
Uryaahh!

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,130
This... Am I still weak even after THIS?

82
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,650
N... nobody's saying that!

83
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,830
Miss Sayaka, you're the strongest in Japan!

84
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,590
Yes, that's exactly right.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
But that... that...

86
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
... please excuse this vulgar phrase...

87
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,800
that piece-of-shit old man!

88
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I refuse.

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,600
R... refuse?

90
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Even with all those benefits, you're 
not willing to be Sayaka's coach?

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,100
Benefits have nothing to do with it.

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Then, what more can we do for you?

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,930
Miss Sayaka, invite me when
you get a little stronger.

94
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,500
I don't teach wimps!

95
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,320
Wh... what did you say?

96
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,500
Oh, don't take back this doggy bag 
just cuz I rejected you!

97
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,000
I've always gotten what I've wanted.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,600
But, those two Inokumas!

99
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,400
Why can't I get it my way?

100
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,300
Sayaka-san's pretty ticked off.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,100
I guess it can't be helped, 
though. But, that time...

102
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,700
Well then, I bid you farewell. I look
forward to more dinner invitations!

103
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Th... this isn't good!

104
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I can't let him leave just like that!

105
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,300
I... Inokuma-sensei!

106
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Eii! You persistent fool! I told you, 
I'm not returning the doggy bag!

107
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,200
N... no... not that... umm...

108
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,800
C... could you sign this book?

109
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,800
Sign? Oh, very well!

110
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,000
Tha... thank you very much!

111
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,300
Tha... thank you very much!

112
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,300
Inokuma Jigoro!

113
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,130
I got him to sign it!

114
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
Oh, what is that?

115
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,500
Oh, nothing at all!

116
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,600
U...umm, let's start the practice, shall we?

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,900
If you're weak on rides, you 
shouldn't have ridden at all!

118
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,200
Hehe, I'm fine. But, you're unaffected...

119
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it because your sense of balance
is more advanced from judo?

120
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,800
Don't talk about me like I'm a cat!

121
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,350
Grandpa! Let's ride that one next!

122
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Come on, come on!

123
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,900
Whoa there, don't pull me so hard.

124
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,600
Oh hey, watch it, watch it.

125
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,100
Oh hey, watch it, watch it.
Grandpa...

126
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,400
Grandpa...

127
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,800
Sir...

128
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Excuse me, sir?

129
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,700
Your order's ready.

130
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,800
How much?

131
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
980 yen, please.

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,300
Hey girl!

133
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Hello!

134
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,100
Do you happen to be Inokuma Yawara?

135
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,800
The one on yesterday's paper?

136
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,600
N... no.

137
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,000
It's gotta be you! C'mon, 
show me a judo move!

138
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,900
You've got the wrong person.

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
Aw, c'mon, show us!

140
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,750
P... please stop!

141
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,900
C'mon!

142
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
C'mon now!

143
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,300
Those jerks!

144
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,800
Geez, I've had...

145
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,500
Enough!

146
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,100
Let's go!

147
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,600
Even if you stay hidden, things
like that will continue.

148
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,700
What... should I do? I can't be outside anymore.

149
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,900
Well, then, you'll have to go public.

150
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,500
W... what?

151
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Just do a match. It doesn't have
to be an official one, either.

152
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,200
You just need to show your skills to everyone.


153
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,100
How could I? If I do, it'll 
only make things worse!

154
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
N... no it's not! L... let me finish...

155
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,800
Hey, hold it!

156
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Let me go!

157
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,400
Let me finish...

158
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,300
Watch out!

159
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,700
Here!

160
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,150
Thanks!

161
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,700
What a waste!

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,700
With all that athletic ability and sharp skills...

163
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,600
What a waste!

164
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,300
But...

165
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,200
I just want to be a normal girl... a normal girl.


166
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,000
Yawara-san.

167
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,900
Do a match and...

168
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,300
LOSE in front of everybody!

169
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
Ma... Matsuda!

170
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,500
Where the hell were you all this time!

171
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,400
Were you on a date with that 
"little sister" of yours?

172
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,740
Because you didn't follow through, we lost 
the big news of Hon'ami Sayaka trying to
hire Inokuma Jigoro as her coach.

173
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,700
Our original scoop is down the 
drain after losing that one!

174
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,900
Listen up! Go find Inokuma
Yawara, or you're fired!

175
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,400
No, that's not enough! 
Go cut your stomach !

176
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,630
At about now, Inokuma Yawara
returned to her home.

177
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,500
Huh?

178
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,500
I was with Inokuma Yawara up until now.

179
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,100
And, she just agreed to do a match.

180
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,100
Wh... what did you say?

181
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,600
She is going to do a match!

182
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,380
And, under our sponsorship, too! The 
place and opponent is our choice!

183
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,500
The place will be the Saikai College Judo Hall.

184
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:24,900
I plan to have the opponent be the 20kg heavier, 72kg-class defender, Tohdoh
Yuki. Any problems with that, sir?





185
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,000
N... no, I... I don't think so...

186
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,000
Tomorrow's front page alteration
will be in time, then?

187
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Y... yes!

188
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,580
M... Matsuda-chan, you're the type of man...

189
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, how should I put it...

190
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:45,300
Banzai! Banzai!

191
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
Yawara-san, where have you 
been all this time?

192
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,340
Who is that motorcycle guy 
that kidnapped you?

193
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
P... please let me through.

194
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,840
Did you hear about your grandfather
becoming Sayaka-san's coach?

195
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,000
P... please quiet down!

196
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,100
I have nothing to tell you now.

197
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,100
For details, please see tomorrow's 
Daily Every Sports.

198
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
That's all for now.

199
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,200
Oh great! Daily Every Sports beat us again!

200
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,700
I'm home!


201
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,340
G... Grandpa!

202
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,100
Argh! You delinquent girl!

203
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,400
Who with, where, and what have you
been doing all this time?

204
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,500
It's no big deal... I just stayed
over at a friend's house.

205
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,900
How could a yet-to-be married girl stay
out all night without permission...

206
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,100
Go join the nunnery! The nunnery!

207
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,700
Oh yeah. This is for you!

208
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,200
This is... good!

209
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,850
Right! I got it from a store 
that hand-bakes it!

210
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,370
I don't care about that. Don't tell me you've spent the night with a random guy...

211
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,350
Oh yeah, that's right. I brought 
you some taiyaki.
taiyaki--fish shaped sweet bean cake

212
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:04,360
taiyaki--fish shaped sweet bean cake

213
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,400
This is also good! The beans are packed all the way into the tail portion. Delicious!

214
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,900
Oh well, I'm going to go change.


215
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,290
Oh, Grandpa. I saw the sports 
news on TV today.

216
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,800
You're going to be Sayaka-san's coach, right? She's got a lot of potential, you know! 
And unlike me, she's motivated, too!

217
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,250
Oh yeah. I have some news, too.

218
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm... going to be in a match.

219
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,800
The Daily Every Sports is the sponsor. 
I'm going to do the what-do-you-call-it...
an exhibition game at some judo hall.

220
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,600
Whatever happens to me won't
affect Grandpa anymore...

221
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,900
...because Grandpa will train Sayaka-san 
and get the gold medal and the 
National Achievement Award.

222
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,200
"Gold medal... and the National 
Achievement Award."

223
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,400
I've heard that phrase a million
times over everyday, but...

224
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,400
I won't be a part of that anymore.

225
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,900
No more of Grandpa's rigorous training!

226
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,500
No more judo... no more...

227
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Yawara!

228
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is what you just said true?

229
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
Say it one more...

230
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,100
Knock on the door before 
you come in, okay!

231
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,000
Wh... what is that exhibi, exi, exhib...

232
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,300
Wh... what is that exhibi, exi, exhib...
The reporters will come 
see me in my match.

233
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,800
The reporters will come 
see me in my match.

234
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,800
Hey, that's just like a practice match!

235
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Isn't my debut your long-awaited dream?

236
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,400
Even though it might not 
matter to you anymore.

237
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,200
No! I won't allow that!

238
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,300
I didn't keep you under wraps all this 
time just for that kind of cheap debut!

239
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,500
Just forget about me!

240
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,330
You're now Sayaka-san's coach, right?

241
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,060
Then you should get attention
with Sayaka-san....

242
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,300
...Grandpa.

243
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
I rejected that offer.

244
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,020
Rejected?

245
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,400
Really?

246
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,700
You're not going to be 
Sayaka-san's coach?

247
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,300
How can I leave you before your debut?

248
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,100
And, I don't teach wimps!

249
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,400
What's with your face?

250
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Grandpa!

251
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,100
And so, is what you said true?

252
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Yeah. It'll probably be on 
tomorrow's morning edition.

253
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,300
I guess it can't be helped.

254
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,100
You've refused to do a match until now, 
but, you're finally willing to do a match.

255
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
We can set up glamorous 
matches in the future so..

256
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,300
Yawara, you've finally decided!
I'm really happy!

257
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,900
But, Grandpa, I'm...

258
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,390
What? Inokuma Yawara is going to lose?

259
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,280
Losing... meaning, on purpose?

260
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,900
Yeah. That's right.

261
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,300
Master, seconds!

262
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,050
If she loses in front of everyone,
they'll see no talent in her.

263
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,900
Their hopes will fade into disappointment.

264
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,600
And she'll go back to being a normal girl, which will end the whole "Yawara" hype.

265
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,600
But why? You were so obsessed
with Yawara-san!


266
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,400
You said she was a once-in-
a-lifetime superstar!

267
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,500
There are those that love to bask 
in all the fame and glory, and 
there are those that just don't.

268
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,230
Matsuda-san, maybe you have 
feelings for Yawara-san?

269
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,900
A guy with that kind of sleazy thought
won't ever understood my feelings!

270
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,400
Dammit!

271
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:27,400
Why do you think I left Yamagata to 
work at such a measly paying job!

272
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,600
Is he a crying drunk?

273
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,000
Ever since I was a kid, I've idolized all kinds
of superstars for all my 25 years alive!

274
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,950
I wanted to use this job to share that excitement with everyone!

275
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,250
A noble reason, right?

276
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,100
Y... yes..

277
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,300
But, it's all over.

278
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,330
It's all a dream!

279
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, there'll be another one... a 
second or third "Yawara-chan".

280
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,500
No there won't!


281
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,630
There won't be another!

282
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Even if I wait 10 years.. or 20 years,

283
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,300
or even a 100 years!

284
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,100
S.sir...

285
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,100
A girl like that won't ever appear agai...

286
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,900
N... no!

287
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Yawara. Where are you, Yawara?

288
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,600
Now that it's settled, it's time for some practice.

289
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,600
Yawara!


290
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,400
Oh, Grandpa. It's kinda late, 
but I'll be making dinner.

291
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,650
I see. You can't fight on 
an empty stomach.

292
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,700
This looks really delicious!

293
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,100
Eat some good food, so you can 
whip the opponent in grand style 
in that inky little practice match!

294
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,670
But... but, Grandpa.

295
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm.. I'm going to LOSE.

296
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,100
964 days to Barcelona Olympics!

297
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Ho,ho,hoh! Finally, Yawara's debut match! Win the match with a lightning fast ippon 
and surprise the heck out of everyone!

298
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,270
Yeah. But, Grandpa, I...

299
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,600
What's wrong, Yawara? What's
taking you so long?

300
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,850
Next time, on "Yawara!"...

301
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
"Yawara's Debut Match! An Ippon Victory Before You Even Know It Happened! Jya!"

302
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,600
If you don't watch it, I'll explode 
a yama-arashi attack on you!
yama-arashi--porcupine
