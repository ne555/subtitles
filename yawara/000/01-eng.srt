FroZen-Evil Presents

2
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,980
Yes, of course. That's why I'd be grateful if you could give me a few comments.

3
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,480
Yes, yes. O-Of course!

4
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,930
That's why I'm calling you.

5
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,700
Yes.

6
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,090
No! That's not it.

7
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,370
You're the clean-up hitter for the Tokyo Mets,

8
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,330
so you need to make a statement about this scandal.

9
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,940
One word. Just one word!


10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,930
What is your relationship with the woman who came out of your apartment?

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,950
Ah, screw you!


12
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,810
You think I <i>want</i> to deal with this crap?!

13
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,840
Sheesh! I'm a sports reporter, but all they want me to do is work scandals!

14
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,700
A purse snatcher! Somebody stop him!

15
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,790
Move it! Move it!
A purse snatcher! Somebody stop him!

16
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,580
Move it! Move it!

17
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,920
Outta my way!

18
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,900
Kamoda!

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,590
Right!

20
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,340
T-Tell me you got that.

21
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,200
I... I... did...

22
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,630
A... Ama...

23
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,880
Amazing!

24
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,490
Watching the skillful Tomoe Nage that took down the purse snatcher, ++

25
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:37,100
this reporter sensed that this girl was destined to shoulder the future of judo. ++

26
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,240
This paper will do its best to locate the mysterious young girl... ++





27
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,010
This sucks! It sucks!
 Such stiff writing won't do.

28
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,370
We need a full-page spread on her panties! Think panties!

29
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,010
It's such a pity. I wish her 
face was in the photo.

30
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,210
What kind of girl was she?


31
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,940
Unfortunately, from where we were, all we could see were her panties.

32
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,870
You're missing the point!


33
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,720
The public is yearning for the birth of an athletic superstar!

34
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,740
This girl has a lot of talent!


35
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,730
I can spot talent when it comes to judo.

36
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,730
As you know, Japan has not been successful in the World Cup or at Wimbledon!

37
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,110
However, I know this girl will conquer the world.

38
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,810
We can't waste our time
 chasing sports scandals.

39
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,740
Do you feel better now, Matsuda?


40
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,650
Well, make sure you play up the panty angle.

41
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,130
Play up her panties? It's an insult to call this photo a mere panty-shot.

42
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,090
Show her panties?

43
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,400
I'd better make a few extra copies.


44
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,740
What's wrong, Yawara?
 You're not concentrating at all!

45
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,050
B-But, Grandpa, I've done 100 pushups, harabai, gyaku-ebi, and kata-ashitobi.

46
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,250
And on top of all that, randori as well!

47
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,790
You fool!

48
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,840
Yawara, sit down for a minute.

49
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm already sitting!

50
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,970
What's the meaning of this?


51
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm shocked. Is this what you do when you're playing hooky from practice?!

52
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,410
Did you forget that I've decreed you can't engage in outside matches?



53
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,170
Grandpa, this wasn't a match.

54
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,570
I just subdued a purse snatcher.

55
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,570
Snatcher, schmatcher!
It's all the same to me!

56
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,130
Yawara, listen to me. The future of judo rests on your shoulders.

57
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,380
However, this fact is the greatest of all secrets.

58
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,230
At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, I foresee that women's judo will be a medal sport.



59
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,860
And that is where you'll make your sensational debut.

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,340
This is my master plan!

61
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,080
Listen carefully, Yawara. Win the Olympic gold medal, and then win the...

62
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,770
National Achievement Award!

63
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,530
That's why you shouldn't be infatuated with men like these!

64
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,400
Grandpa, you searched my room again, didn't you?

65
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,710
"I'm writing this letter in my room and drinking black tea."

66
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,630
"I wonder what you're doing at this moment."

67
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,240
Your handwriting is so curly and cutesy I can hardly read it!

68
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,890
That's cruel.

69
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,840
You're my grandpa, and I respect you, but you shouldn't read my letters.



70
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,910
Did you make it to first or second base with that boy?

71
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,340
You didn't go all the way home, did you?

72
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,310
Don't be ridiculous!

73
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,310
Wait a minute, Yawara.

74
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,860
If you win an Olympic gold medal and the Achievement Award,


75
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,110
then wonderful men will pursue you.

76
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,070
Stop it! Who cares about the National
 Achievement Award or an Olympic gold medal?

77
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,030
In 1992, I'll be 20 years old!

78
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,120
Until then, what kind of youth will I have?

79
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,040
A worthwhile one.

80
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,590
Since I was a child, you've been training me,
 but I won't be misled any longer.

81
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,290
I want to be a normal girl.

82
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,680
I want to fall in love like other girls.

83
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,620
And another thing. Don't you ever barge into my room again!


84
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,410
You're soft! Soft and squishy, Yawara. ++

85
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,570
And speaking of squishy, there should be a box of yokan jelly left in the cupboard. ++

86
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,380
Give me a break! How dare he make decisions about my life.

87
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,440
I'm leaving now.

88
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,180
I'm certain that this is
 the same school uniform.

89
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,810
Are you sure we should be
 doing this, Matsuda-san?

90
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,540
If the chief finds out what we're up to, he'll have our butts.

91
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,950
Idiot! How can we endure spending every day looking for scandals?!

92
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,950
We're on the verge of discovering the superstar of the next generation.

93
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,950
Soon, the day will come when the chief will shed tears of joy.

94
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,210
I-I hope you're right.



95
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:53,210
<i>My love is fine the way it is.</i>

96
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,140
<i>She told me that as she left.</i>

97
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,570
Nishikimori-san is totally owning the school festival.

98
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,360
I heard that a scout from the Journey Talent Agency came here.

99
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,740
When he graduates, he'll finally
 make his big debut.

100
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,220
He looked this way! He looked this way!

101
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,330
Nishikimori-kun!

102
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,330
What's with this Nishikimori-kun?

103
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,530
Hey, aren't you mortified that someone like him gets all the girls?

104
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,570
We're disgusted!

105
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,850
I'm also mortified.

106
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,460
Who cares about good looks?!

107
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,850
A man's virtue comes from the inside. We compete with what's inside!

108
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,450
And if that's true, then I'm also beautiful.

109
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,370
Right?

110
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,320
Y-Yes...

111
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,820
Run 100 laps around the school grounds!

112
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,750
Forgive me.

113
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,330
In any case, I don't like him.

114
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,600
Should we stomp him?

115
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,850
Go ahead, stomp him!

116
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,410
Wh-Who the hell are you, old man?

117
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,090
That evil Nishikimori!

118
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,780
My granddaughter is in the clutches of his poisonous claws.

119
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,410
His poisonous claws?

120
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,100
Really, old man?

121
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,850
He has attacked my innocent
granddaughter many, many times.

122
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,440
What?!

123
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,290
She now drowns her misery by wearing make-up,

124
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,190
as well as flashy clothes, and by frequenting that den of iniquity called the “desco”!

125
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,190
Going to discos?!

126
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,660
And then, she got involved with a gangster at the desco.

127
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:47,200
He forced her to work in a sleazy business to make money for him!

128
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,300
I've been rather weak lately, and this situation has aggravated my illness.

129
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,810
Are you all right, old man?

130
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,700
Nishikimori! This is unforgivable!

131
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,980
Here she is. The girl we're looking for.

132
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,980
Second year, class B: Inokuma Yawara.

133
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,480
Th-This girl may be...

134
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,650
Look! She lives at the same address as the famous Inokuma Jigoro!

135
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,990
Inokuma Jigoro. I've heard that name somewhere before.

136
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,340
Inokuma is the only man ever to win five straight victories in the All-Japan Judo Championship.

137
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,980
He's a judo genius!

138
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,840
I suspect that Inokuma Yawara is his granddaughter.

139
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,590
What's wrong, Yawara?

140
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,490
The competition is very stiff.
 You've gotta be more aggressive.

141
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,570
One per person, one per person...

142
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,900
I-I can't do it today.

143
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,730
Hey, Yawara!

144
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,880
Alas, poor Yawara. You've fallen in love with a playboy.

149
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,670
Grandpa?

150
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,560
Grandpa!

151
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,690
Grandpa... huh?

152
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,660
You can do it, Yawara!

153
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,920
Yes, Nishikimori speaking.

154
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,440
Hello? Hello?

155
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,440
Um...

156
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,960
Hello? Who's there?

157
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,420
Um...

158
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,250
Hello?

159
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,360
I'm sorry. Wrong number!

160
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,880
Challenge!

161
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,530
Challenge!

162
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,000
Challenge!

163
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,900
Who is it? Can't you ring the doorbell?

164
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,280
So we have a masked wrestler!

165
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,050
Don't be silly. It's a face mask.

166
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,010
I don't know what you're doing, but it's strange.

167
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,230
Anyway, what do you want? I'm not paying the NHK fee.

168
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,060
Wait!

169
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,920
What is it?

170
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,300
The reason I came to see you is this.

171
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,760
Please do not make advances toward my granddaughter.

172
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,170
Your granddaughter? Who's she?

173
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,760
I'm talking about Inokuma Yawara.

174
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,310
Inokuma?

175
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,270
I don't think I know her.

176
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,520
As you might know, I have many fans. I can't remember every face or name.

177
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,190
Consider this a warning from the referee!

178
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:53,130
Don't you have the sincerity to devote yourself entirely to just one girl?!

179
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,040
I don't know what you're talking about,

180
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,750
but I've been advised by
 my agent to act prudently.

181
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,800
Since I'm an idol, I don't go out with one specific girl. Well, then...

182
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,490
Wait! Listen carefully!

183
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,890
If you make further advances toward Yawara, I will use my "deathblow techniques."

184
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,720
Don't force me to use them for
something insignificant like this!

185
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,500
Hey! Do you understand?

186
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,400
Please leave and take these.

187
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,070
Oh, and buy my records and CDs too.

188
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,730
Wh-What are these?

189
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,290
My autograph and picture.

190
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,260
What lousy handwriting.

191
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,380
I'll correct it.

192
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,760
Moron!

193
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,400
Well, it should be around here.

194
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,480
Should we really be doing-

195
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,610
This way. Let's go!

196
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,420
Hey, okay!

197
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,990
What?!

198
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,260
Y-You went to see Nishikimori-san?

199
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,460
Delicious. These strawberry-filled rice cakes are exquisite.


200
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,420
I'm too ashamed to see him. This is the end.

201
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,440
Yawara, don't you want one?

202
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,610
Grandpa, you idiot!

203
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,640
You don't want to eat these delicious sweets?

204
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,260
I wonder if Yawara is perhaps feeling ill.

205
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,010
Delicious!

206
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,380
Hello?

207
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,300
Yawara study judo?


208
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,730
Have some homemade radish pickles.

209
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,770
Yes. Thank you.

210
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,990
Well, I can understand how
 you got the wrong idea.

211
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,090
After all, I <i>am</i> the judo genius who won

212
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,420
the All-Japan Judo Championship five times in a row.

213
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,820
Y-Yes...

214
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,630
But that was more than 30 years ago.

215
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:28,070
I'm retired and don't practice judo anymore.
These days, I make a living doing bone setting.

216
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,050
Why, the very idea of me teaching her judo is silly, quite silly...

217
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,330
Yes.

218
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,800
Here.

219
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,880
Oh, sorry.

220
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,170
By the way, 6-dan Master Inokuma...

221
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,590
I'm a 7-dan!

222
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,540
Ah, that's right, 7-dan Master Inokuma, can we see your dojo?

223
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,310
If I can see the dojo, I can tell whether or not they’ve been practicing. ++

224
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,480
Good plan! ++

225
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,090
If you wish.

226
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,100
As you can see,

227
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:10,120
my dojo, which was a place of blood, sweat, and tears, is now used to race slot cars.

228
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,530
This Ferrari is very fast.

229
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,530
Well, won't you have a race or two?

230
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,000
S-Sorry for bothering you.

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,540
Me too. Sorry for bothering you!

232
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,510
Well, when you feel like racing,
 please come again.

233
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,300
Thank you. Well, please excuse us.

234
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,940
It's already this late?

235
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,060
Matsuda-san, we're in trouble!

236
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,000
Mission accomplished.

237
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,980
I'll never allow a third-rate
newspaper to get this scoop.

238
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,250
Yawara must make a <i>sensational</i> debut.

239
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,170
See you, Yawara.

240
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,950
See you!

241
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,500
That must be Inokuma Yawara.

242
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Do we follow her?

243
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,170
Judging from the old man, I don't think she has anything to do with judo.

244
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,550
I've got a hunch that the old geezer is hiding something.

245
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,850
Are you sure?

246
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,420
Let's go.

247
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,590
Y-Yes.

248
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,620
Nishikimori-san, please don't forget us after you make your formal debut.




249
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,560
Please buy my records.

250
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,220
Of course. We will follow you
wherever you go, Nishikimori-san!

251
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,150
Buy my CDs too!

252
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,580
Of course.
As I thought, he hasn't mended his ways.

253
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,330
As I thought, he hasn't mended his ways.

254
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,460
He may still make advances toward Yawara.


255
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,440
Time to give him a real attitude adjustment.

256
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,160
Wh-Who are you?

257
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,300
Nishikimori! You bastard, I heard that you seduced a young girl...

258
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,170
and on top of that, you forced her into a sleazy business!

259
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,210
What?



260
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,170
Now receive our Iron Fists of Justice!

261
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,220
W-Wait for me!

262
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,090
Wait!

263
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,300
Help!

264
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,790
Get him!

265
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,810
What?! Only a total cad shows his back to the enemy!

266
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,820
Help!

267
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Nishikimori!

268
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Wait!

269
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,250
Help!

270
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,010
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

271
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,020
Chastise him to your heart's content!

272
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,140
Nishikimori!

273
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,690
What did I do?

274
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,600
Don't! Pretend! To! Be! Innocent!

275
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,240
Yawara...

276
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,970
As things were going dark, this reporter witnessed... ++

277
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:18,180
a performance that one day would be re-enacted before the entire world... ++

278
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,060
one day... for sure. ++

279
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,250
Do you see, Yawara? This is his true spirit.





280
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,440
Now throw that man on his back, hard!

281
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,440
Nishikimori-san...

282
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,160
Y-Yes?

283
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,220
If you need help, call me.

284
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,490
I'll protect you.

285
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,920
Since then, whenever he
sees me, Nishikimori-san... ++

286
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,800
flees in abject terror. ++

287
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,260
I will never, ever practice judo again!

288
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,050
G-Grandpa...




289
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,340
Listen, Yawara. Your youth belongs to judo! ++

290
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:50,780
Win the People's Honor Award and become Japan's shining star! ++
