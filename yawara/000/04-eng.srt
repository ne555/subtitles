00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,600
kuchibiruni melody itsushika kizamu yuugure.

2
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:31,000
Machi o mioroseba kimi no sugata mieru.

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,400
Akirame kirenai. Yume no kakera sutenaide!

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,600
Mooichido sono mune atatame naoshiteyo.

5
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,200
Koosaten no hito no nagare. 
Ima, dare, doko, nani shiteru?

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:02,300
Suna no naka no daiyamondo
Sagasu mitaina tokimeki!

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,700
kiseki wa itsudemo kimi no heart shidai.

8
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,210
Hitomi no negai wa itsuka kanawu hazuyoo.

9
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,470
Not good enough. Not good enough.

10
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,290
Stand up, Sayaka-san.

11
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,250
Let's rest a while. How about some tea?


12
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,470
You are taking it too easy. It is like eating 
a Marron glace together with anmitsu.

13
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,380
Do you think you can beat 
Yawara Inokuma this way?

14
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,830
Kazamatsuri-san, ever since you met 
Yawara Inokuma, you've become
a completely different person.

15
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,980
That's right!

16
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,200
Your opponent is the grand-daughter 
of Master Jigoro Inokuma.

17
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,630
Master Inokuma is the author of my favorite book, Judo is not build in a day.

18
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,690
In addition, he won the All Japan Championships five times.



19
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:34,360
Yawara Inokuma is the person to 
whom he taught his splendid art.

20
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,970
I want to see it. I want to see her skills.

21
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,770
No good! Such a half-hearted 
lesson is not good enough.

22
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,210
You're right. They must be practicing
judo until they shed blood.

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,420
My elbows are bleeding since he forced
me to practice harabai so many times.
harabai--move on one's stomach.

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,690
Tighten your sides, Yawara.

25
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,330
Put everything into it, Yawara.

26
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,040
Yawara.

27
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,320
Yawara!

28
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,070
Yawara...

29
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,610
Yawara!

30
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,940
Yawara, how could you sneak out 
of the lesson to take a bath?

31
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,020
Because my elbow got all 
scraped up and it's painful.

32
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,840
You're trying to stay away from the 
lesson for one reason or another.

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,880
I have a date with Kazamatsuri-san tomorrow.

34
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,220
I have no time to practice.

35
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,550
Here! Use my special lizard 
oil for scraped skin.

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,190
Aaaa! Pervert!

37
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,640
Even if you are my grand-father, you're 
not allowed to peep into the bathroom.

38
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,450
I wish you would exhibit the 
same spirit towards judo.

39
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,070
I wonder when she grew up so much.

40
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,600
Even though she's my grand-daughter,
it was a bit too stimulating.

41
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:07,820
Episode 4
This is my strategy to make Yawara
take part in a real match.

42
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,730
The smell of tea, a delicious cake, 
and a wonderful man.

43
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,180
I'm so happy to be able to have this
dream-like Saturday afternoon.

44
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,540
It was indeed wonderful, that Osotogari.

45
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,630
Oh, you didn't watch Sayaka Honami's tournament on television, the other day?


46
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,420
Sorry, I'm not interested in judo.

47
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,150
Is that so?

48
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,910
Sayaka-san is right. She hardly 
shows any interest in judo.

49
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,130
But today is the last day you 
can pretend to be innocent.

50
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,440
I'll reveal your true power today.

51
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,380
Err...

52
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,740
Please.

53
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,440
You go first, Inokuma-san.

54
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,580
No, Err... Well... ummm...

55
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,000
That's right! Tell me all about your secret.

56
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,620
Well...

57
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,000
You always dress so well.

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,960
I get them during bargain sales. All of this.

59
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,340
That's wonderful. I, too, buy only at
bargain sales. Do you stand in line?

60
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:29,940
Pardon?

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,090
When you go to a bargain sale.

62
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,640
Of course I stand in line. Usually, 
I stand in line all night long.

63
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,860
Amazing!

64
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,820
That's not it! I didn't come here 
to talk about this with her.

65
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,050
Chief, look at all the commotion made
by the mass media about Yawara.

66
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,190
Ever since Sayaka Honami challenged 
Yawara on television, there has been 
this "Yawara Fever" everywhere.

67
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,540
Ever since Sayaka Honami challenged 
Yawara on television, there has been 
this "Yawara Fever" everywhere.
Challenge to Yawara.
Find who Yawara is.

68
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,740
Challenge to Yawara.
Find who Yawara is.

69
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,460
Yawara is the girl whom I'm trying to locate.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,980
Please. Let me print this picture again.


71
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,630
Only we have the proof.

72
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,270
This does not serve as a proof.

73
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,430
Bring proof that she is the real Yawara to me.

74
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,470
If I could, I would have brought 
it to you a long time ago.

75
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,530
If you can't get it, then stop it!

76
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,670
We can't have you wasting all your time working on this pointless "pan-chira" girl.

77
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,890
Pointless "pan-chira" girl?

78
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,110
Understood! I'll definitely bring one.

79
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,510
Proof that will knock your socks off.

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,090
Let's go, Kameda.

81
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,100
Okay!


82
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,230
Listen, chief!

83
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,370
I'm going to get the scoop.

84
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,970
Soon will be the day when the pointless "pan-chira" girl will become the 
idol to 120 million people.

85
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,750
You again?

86
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,760
Until you tell me the truth, I'll 
come back again and again.

87
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,950
Have some home-made dried persimmons.

88
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,350
Thank you. Here.

89
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,310
You can't bribe me with 
a dried persimmon.

90
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm determined to get Master Inokuma's acknowledgment today.

91
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,620
This old man does not have any recollection that I was to be called master by you.

92
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,910
Stop playing these monkey games with me...

93
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,900
You have no right to call me a monkey.

94
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,560
Look at these newspapers.

95
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,830
Look at these newspapers.
Who is the real Yawara?

96
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,960
Who is the real Yawara?

97
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
Who is the real Yawara?
All of them are making a 
great uproar over Yawara.

98
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,300
All of them are making a 
great uproar over Yawara.

99
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,710
All of them are talking about your grand-daughter, right?

100
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,830
That's right.

101
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,540
So, you finally admit it?

102
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,490
That's right.

103
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,040
That girl is my grand-daughter, Yawara.

104
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,240
I beg you.

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,050
Please give us the scoop.

106
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,860
No! I will not!

107
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:36,440
Since Sayaka Honami made her 
debut in a grand style, Yawara's 
debut must be better than hers.

108
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,460
Well. Our paper will push Yawara 
staking the future of our company.

109
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,640
Please leave. I will not permit a third 
class newspaper to have the scoop.

110
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,210
Yawara must make a debut 
according to my plan.

111
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,570
It's already developed in my head.

112
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,730
The 7th dan Master Inokuma.

113
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,180
I have the 8th dan.

114
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,300
The time is ripe.

115
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,740
So, Miss Inokuma, you like cooking?

116
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,030
Yes. I cook Beef Stroganoff very well.

117
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,640
Beef Stroganoff? I would 
like to try it sometime.

118
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,630
Really!? I'll make the best one for you.

119
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,690
I'll look forward to your Beef Stroganoff.

120
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm embarrassed.

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,950
Ouch, that hurts!

122
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,760
The way she fell did not give any indication 
that she had any knowledge of judo.

123
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,860
Is she really practicing judo?

124
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,920
I have to be careful. I almost used ukemi.
ukemi--a special judo technique to prepare 
the body to accept some blow.

125
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,320
Are you alright?

126
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,620
Yes.

127
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,270
You were a bit careless.

128
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,420
This scraped skin. This is the result 
of practicing forward harabai.

129
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,940
I'm ashamed.

130
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,670
My arms have scars from scraped 
skin. Perhaps, this girl...

131
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,650
Now is my opportunity. 
Let me challenge her.

132
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,570
She's thoroughly on guard. If I try to
attack her, what will happen to me?

133
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,810
Throw me. I'm ready.

134
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,750
This can't be happening! What 
should I do? What should I do!?

135
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,890
Finally, I will get my first kiss.

136
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:53,500
She's defenseless! This girl can't 
be a genius in judo. She can't be!

137
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,480
Yawara Inokuma...

138
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,440
A date?

139
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,820
You must be joking, little girl.

140
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,660
Tell us what kind of a man he is.

141
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,600
Well... He's tall, handsome, and the sporty type.

142
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,590
How dare you!

143
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,930
... and how far did you go with him?

144
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,230
We went to a cafe and to the park.

145
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,050
Don't play dumb. You know, A, B, or C...

146
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,400
To tell you the truth...

147
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,440
He tried to kiss you!?

148
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,930
He was just about to.

149
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,500
Kazamatsuri-san.

150
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,410
Sorry. Please forgive me.

151
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,970
It must be true love!

152
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,430
That's right. If he really likes 
you, he's unable to do it.

153
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,910
Do you think so?

154
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,200
I hate you!

155
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,780
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

156
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,880
I'm fine. Oh, no.

157
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,110
Do you belong to the Judo Club?

158
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,060
Yes. I must wash them again.

159
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,690
Give them to me. I'll wash them for you.

160
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,520
I cannot accept your offer. I'm not 
good at judo, so I have to at least 
do some work to compensate.

161
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Don't worry. I'm the one
who caused all this.

162
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,150
No...

163
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,940
Yawara, he's saying it's O.K.

164
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,240
Don't worry. I'm used to washing judo suits.

165
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:43,960
What!?

166
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,410
Oh, nothing. BY the way, when do 
I have to return them to you?

167
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,590
Let's see. We have extra judo suits, 
so you don't need to rush.

168
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,920
Good. I'll also mend the ripped areas.

169
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,980
No... that's too much...

170
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,620
You won't be strong if you 
continue to wash judo suits.

171
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,400
No, one lesson... No, two lesson...

172
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,020
Since you insist, I'll leave them to you.

173
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,350
How did you feel at that time?

174
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,030
Are you still asking that silly question?

175
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,090
She's a typical female high school student.

176
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,240
No. Soon she will show her true color.

177
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,130
By the way, Yawara.

178
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,910
Yes.

179
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,660
There's a big bargain sale in Shibuya tomorrow. Do you want to go?

180
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,180
A bargain? I'll come. I'll come. 
I'll definitely come.

181
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,620
Alright. Then, let's meet in front of 
the Hachiko statue at 3:00 pm.

182
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,310
Yes.

183
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,780
A bargain sale? I want to go, too!


184
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,160
I'll go anywhere she goes...

185
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,190
... and, we'll take the photo... Only one is needed, to capture her real power.

186
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
Judo Club.

187
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,700
I wish you would stop folk-dancing.

188
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,110
Are you going to disgrace yourselves 
again at the tournament with 
Ganryuji High School tomorrow?

189
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:23,310
Judo is a sport to throw your 
opponent like this to win.

190
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,930
Please win at least once.

191
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,640
I'll be a senior soon and before I graduate,
I want us to win at least once.

192
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,790
Hanazono-san is crying again.

193
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,220
Our captain cries easily.

194
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,710
Don't stand around...Continue free practice.

195
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,280
This is not good.

196
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,880
I wanted Yawara to have a real fighting experience before she makes her debut.

197
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,400
They are no match for her. I thought 
there was hope in the big captain, 
but he's just a mad gorilla.

198
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,430
He uses only his physical power
and is far from skillful.

199
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,890
I heard you over the window.

200
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,600
Excuse me. Oh my!

201
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,100
It's been a long time since I 
enjoyed seeing children play.

202
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,100
Damn you, you mustached old man!

203
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,850
Wait, I will not permit an outsider 
to say such slander about us.

204
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,510
Who are you?

205
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm an amateur judo lover 
who's just passing by.

206
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,330
I see you have not won any 
tournament this year.

207
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,990
I'm ashamed.

208
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,600
Long time ago, our club competed 
at the National Tournament.

209
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:55,860
However, nowadays, since I became 
captain of the club, I am the only senior, 
and the rest are just 4 freshmen.

210
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,100
We may not be able to participate 
in the group tournament tomorrow 
if we miss even one member.

211
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,340
Is tomorrow's opponent, the 
Ganryuji High School, strong?

212
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,230
Yes. Frankly speaking, we 
were equally competitive.

213
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,250
During our past regional tournaments, 
we always tried to surpass each other 
and exhibited great matches.

214
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,960
... but now the difference is so obvious.

215
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,290
They cast their pitiful eyes on us.

216
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,510
I told the team that I don't expect them to 
win the tournament, but they shouldn't disgrace themselves, either.

217
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,280
There's no sense in losing a fight.

218
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,360
In any battle, there is only 
one way to spell victory.

219
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,230
But...

220
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,350
Leave it to me.

221
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,330
I'll make sure you win.

222
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,990
Master.

223
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,250
Master? It's music to my ears.

224
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,980
There is a big rip.

225
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,290
Grandpa!

226
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,140
You are washing judo suits.

227
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,890
I'm impressed. But, why so many?

228
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,980
They belong to the judo club of my school.

229
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,580
What? They belong to the judo 
club of your school? Is that so?

230
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,840
What is it? You're acting strangely.

231
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,590
The Ganryuji High School

232
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,820
Don't act intimidated.

233
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,320
Okay!

234
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,190
There are only 5 club members.

235
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,870
Sasaki.

236
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,920
Hanazono, I guess your club is strong
even though there are few members.

237
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,110
Um... I am very delighted that the four time
All Japan champion, Mr. Inokuma, is volunteering as the adviser to our school.

238
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,610
I won 5 times.


239
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,360
The captain, Hanazono, hinted to me that you have some strategy for today's tournament.

240
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,700
Wait and see.

241
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,620
Come here. I will give you special instructions.

242
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,700
Since I have to be at Shibuya at 3 o'clock. 
I had better get ready soon.

243
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,430
Yes, this is Inokuma. What!?

244
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,150
I'm sorry, Miss Inokuma. We cannot start 
the tournament without the suits.

245
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,560
Don't you have extra suits?

246
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,630
B... but. A... anyway, please bring 
them here immediately. Please.!

247
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
You're so selfish!

248
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,900
He said anytime. Kaori and the gang 
are waiting for me at Shibuya.

249
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,920
What if I miss the bargain sale?

250
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,680
Gym closet.

251
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,720
Be good. It won't be too long.

252
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,780
What? Kawada is gone?

253
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,450
I think the judo club of the Musashiyama High School has fallen to the bottom of the barrel.

254
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,610
Running away before the tournament 
is the lowest act of all!

255
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,870
I hate judo!

256
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:35,020
I ask you to leave. We do not wish to have a tournament with the team whose members disappear when facing the opponent.

257
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,480
Please reconsider. I propose to have the tournament between 5 members vs. 4.

258
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,130
Have a sense of shame, a sense of shame.

259
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,320
The 7th dan master Inokuma, 
we have a terrible situation.

260
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,930
I have the 8th dan.

261
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,220
Should I put a judo suit on 
and be a member?

262
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,850
Wait for awhile. Soon she will 
come. The Goddess of Victory.

263
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,220
Damn... Where is the judo hall?

264
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,270
I better hurry up or I'll 
miss the bargain sale.

265
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,590
What is everyone looking at? 
Ahh... Here's the judo uniforms.

266
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,590
You are Inokuma from Junior B class.

267
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,100
Hanazono-kun.

268
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,740
Why are you here? It doesn't matter.

269
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,770
Ehh, everyone has a judo suit on. 
Never mind. Well, see ya.

270
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,590
What is it? Let me go.

271
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,780
Everyone. All the members are here. 
She's a member of the Musashiyama 
High School Judo Club.

272
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,120
Don't make fun of us. Do you expect
us to fight with a woman?

273
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,370
I know I'm making an
unreasonable request.

274
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,680
In addition, I want to request 
that we change the rules.

275
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,050
The rules of the tournament?

276
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,420
I request that we do not use the 
usual senposen or taishosen.

277
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,430
Instead, I wish to propose kachinukisen.

278
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,600
Hanazono-kun...

279
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,990
Listen Inokuma, you'll be
the head of the team...

280
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,810
The head?

281
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,770
I will be the vice captain...
I will never let you fight.

282
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,330
I don't understand what you are talking about. I'm going to a bargain sale.

283
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,930
Please, Inokuma. All you have to do is 
to wear a judo suit and to sit with us.

284
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,710
Wait a minute. A girl? A girl? 
We can legally tackle a girl!

285
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,240
A Kachinukisen tournament would give everyone a chance to touch a girl!

286
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,210
Let go of me. I must go.

287
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:37,280
Let go of me. I must go.
Please, Inokuma.

288
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,990
Please, Inokuma.

289
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:45,580
Hanazono, we will be generous 
like samurai should. We accept all 
of your requests. Right, everyone?

290
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm really grateful.

291
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,720
Wait a minute. Why do I have to 
participate in the tournament?

292
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,470
We will win so that you will not have 
to be in it. Please, Inokuma.

293
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,530
Hanazono-kun...

294
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,200
I really have to go to Shibuya. 
Please finish as soon as possible.

295
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,340
Ahh, it will be over soon. 
Just leave it to me.

296
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,930
Grandpa! Why, why is he here?

297
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,920
Change Room.

298
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:33,920
I wanted to press him for an answer, but if
they discover that I'm his grand-daughter, 
it might cause even more trouble.

299
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,120
I don't have a T-shirt.

300
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,380
Inokuma, are you ready?

301
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,690
Inokuma, are you ready?
Pervert!

302
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,200
Pervert!

303
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,620
What am I going to do? If I fight without a T-shirt, I'll never be able to get married.

304
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,650
Ready, Yawara? This is 
your first real fight.

305
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:22,870
992 days till the Olympics in Barcelona

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,020
A girl... A girl... A girl... This is the 
first time we fought with a girl.

307
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,500
Idiots and perverts. This is a judo tournament. What are they thinking about?

308
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,180
This is the harsh reality of a real fight.

309
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,760
On the next Yawara.




310
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,340
The moment of a real match has arrived. The road to "Judo Yawara" is not built in a day.

311
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,450
Watch. My Ippon zuyoi will explode.

312
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,040
No. You perverts! Don't look!
