1
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,765
What's the matter with you?!
You've become such a wimp.

2
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,933


3
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,559
Hmm.. Wh... What?!

4
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,733
Yawaraw your lin collar is unusually
bright. ls this a l'ilpstjck stain?!

5
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,195
I'm old enough to wear lipstick!

6
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,613
You idiot!

7
00:01:54,155 --> 00:02:00,495
If you wiln the gold medal and the award, you'll
be invited to parties where you need to
wear lipstick even if you don't want tn.

8
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,580
How many times do I have to tell you?!

9
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:07,210
l have no interest in Winning the gold medal
or the National Achievement Award.

10
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,752


11
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,963
Yawara, sit dawn for a minute.

12
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,507
l"m already sitting.

13
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,429
Yawalra, why aren't you taking judo seriously?

14
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:21,224
I think there's only one reasan for
you not to be serious about jwudo.

15
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,311
IIt's because you have no rivals!

16
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:26,855
Riva ls?

17
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,189


18
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:34,404
That's right, like Shimn Takeda and Kenshin
Uesusgi, Mumhi Miyamato and Kojiro Sasaki.

19
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:34,863


20
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,032
Recently. Ta'iko and Kashiwa.

21
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:37,323


22
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,700
They're not recent figures.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,367


24
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:45,790
In the recent judo world, Yamashita and
Saito were fierce competitors. They
honed their ski'l-ls agaimt each other.

25
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,082


26
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,834
L-Listen, Grandpa. . .

27
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,796
Don't say it! You wan-t to have rivals whom
you can compete with, don't you?

28
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,966
Grandpa, I don't want to have any rivals.

29
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,429
All I want is to be a normal girl. I want to faxl'l in
love with someone and dress-up sometimes...

30
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:06,353
If you head a serious rival, yew would not say such
a thing I'm going to find one immediautety.

31
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,730
Just a minute. Grandpa!

32
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,033
l"m really bored.

33
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,241


34
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,702
Please stop playing around, Miss.

35
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,329
Miss !


36
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,923
T-Thafs why I suggested not to retire from
the tennis worid for awhile, Mais;

37
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:41,888
You should wait just a little longer
until next year's Wimbledon.

38
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,515
What about Wimbledon?

39
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,520
At the exhibition match by Navratilova, l was
disgusted by the world's tennis standards.

40
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,023
Well then, how about returning to gymnastics?

41
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,233


42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,780
Tankunaga, I've already experienced
the ultimate beauty of gymnastics.

43
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,032
Swi mmimg. . .

44
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:02,951
Ridi ng. . .

45
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:04,703
Tennis. . .

46
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,705
Ski. . .

47
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:08,581
Figure Skating...

48
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,044
They left me with empty
feelings, like biting sand.

49
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,795


50
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:18,091
I have all the honor and money. Why isn't there
anyone who can set my spirit on fire?

51
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,512
Tokunaga, why was I buorn so multi-taluented?

52
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,973
Let's go home.

53
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,236
P-vPleage forgi...

54
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,697


55
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,741
Were you injured?

56
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,369
You threatened our lives. Who are you?

57
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,788
Did you know that I'm J-ivgoro lnokuxma?

58
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,205


59
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:53,084
A... Absolutely not. Really. I have no excuse.

60
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,462
I was careless and wasn't keeping
my eyes on the road.

61
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,006
Tokunaga, please invite them to our
house and treat their injuries.

62
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,884
No, we're fine. We weren't hurt.

63
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:01,426


64
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,347
I don't believe that you are atright.
The accident must have hurt you...

65
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,933
Do you know ukemi?

66
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,938
I can't bet you go after thjE. I"ll
get scolded by my master.

67
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,149
Do you serve sweets?

68
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,319
I'm asking you if you serve sweets.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,321
Gra ndpa !

70
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:26,242
Today cur cook made a western style sweet.

71
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,452
Is it edible?

72
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,914
Forget it. Don't pay any attention
to him. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,333
I'm asking if it is edible.

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:33,625


75
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,710
I certainly think it is.

76
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,169


77
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,504
How about you show me the way, then?

78
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,682
Amazing!

79
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,558
IIt's only a humble house.

80
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,521
Our house in Canada is twice as big as this ane.

81
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:54,729


82
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,150
Our house in Australia is three times
bigger than that of Canada.

83
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,611


84
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,698
This is del'iuciuus. I want secands.

85
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:05,782
Y-Yes.

86
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:05,949
Gra n dxpa !
Y-Yes.

87
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,700
Gra ndxpa!

88
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,496
Instead of giving me little servings of
cream in this pretty plate, I'd prefer
if yuu served me a large bowl of it.

89
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,872
Grandpa, really!

90
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,877


91
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,130
Oh, these are splendid trophies.

92
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,547


93
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,882
Seishin Wumawn's School... Sayaaka Honami.

94
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,220
They were awarded to you, young lady?

95
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,556
They're just made out of gims.

96
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,232
Th... Th... This way. This
way. This way. Done.

97
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:44,362
Th... Th... This way.

98
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:51,244


99
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,040
Miss, they're completely destroyed.

100
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,084
Mnninng has no value to me.

101
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,254
The issue is how excited they can make me.

102
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,970
But, I have nothing tn get extited about.

103
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,266
Fot those who are given one ability by God,
they do not understand how boring it is.

104
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:18,396
I regret that God has given me not
only two, but three abilities.

105
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,778
We-Il, judo was not among them?

106
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,321
Judo?

107
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:27,697
Grandpa!

108
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,077
Saying that without knowing judo
its like a frog in the pond.

109
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,078


110
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:33,828
Grandpa.

111
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,292
To me, judo is wrestling for barbarians.

112
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,712
You are making a hasty judgment wiihout
knowing anything about it.

113
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:47,133
Even this obd fraiil body can still beat the young!

114
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,553
That's judo.


115
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,182
Kamata! Kamata, are you there?

116
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,061
You called, Miss?

117
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,231
My body guard, Kamata, is Sth dan iin judo.

118
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,859
To prove what you've said,
throw this man down.

119
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,863
I can throw a big unskilled fellaw
like this with one hand.

120
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,326
Grandpa, let's go! Thank
you for your hospitality.

121
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,162
Attack me any way you like.

122
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,996
Grandpa!

123
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:29,300


124
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,344
Are you sure this is okay, Miss?

125
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:47,110
Oh, no, now you've done it. Grandpa, you idiot!

126
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,528


127
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,114
Did I surprise you, Miss?

128
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,119
There will be more surprises.

129
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,749
I know a giwl who is much stronger than
I am. She's the same age as you are.

130
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,041
Oh no, don't!

I know a girl who is much stronger than
I am. She's the same age as you are.

131
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,791
Oh no, don't!

132
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,588
There's no one like that. This old man
is always saying things like that.

133
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,549
Please don't be concerned about what he said.
Well, I'm afraid we've stayed too long.

134
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:09,841


135
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,594
Who's the strong g-iri, who is she?

136
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,846
I won't disclase her name to a weak person.

137
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,724


138
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,060
M-Miss, I just remembered.

139
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,226


140
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:26,316
He's Inokuma, who achieved S successive
victories at the All Japan Judo Championship.

141
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,734


142
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,903
YouTe out of control. You threw him
down to your heart's content.

143
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,445
Yodre out of control. You threw him
down to your heart's content.

144
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,323


145
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,577
Iknow a girl who's your age
that's stronger than I am!

146
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:38,912
Tokuinagaw . .

147
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:39,996
Yes...

148
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,918
Call the designer Mori Hanae from
Paris. I need new clothes.

149
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,630
Yes, Missw What kind of clothes?

150
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,842
Judo clothes.

151
00:09:52,842 --> 00:10:09,442


152
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,071
Jigo'ro IInnkuma, it's been a month.

153
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:13,154


154
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,826
When you see the results of my hard training.
you"lll be" me the whereabouts of the girl.

155
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:18,451


156
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,080
But I wonder if I've became stranger than her.

157
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,957
I'm late. I'm late.

158
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,546
Ah, Sayaka-san.. l"m sorry. I'm in a hurry.

159
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,508
Wait! I'm sure you know her too.

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,759
What are you talking about?

161
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,051


162
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,095
You know the identity of the
really strong girl, don't you?

163
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:37,679


164
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,682
I 'm realty in a hurry! I have a test!

165
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,683


166
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,060
I will not let you hide that information from me.

167
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,769


168
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,729
Please re lease me.

169

If you dan't tell me, you'll get hurt.

170

You want me to show you the
results of my hard training?

171
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,112

00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,168

Oh no! You lost a tooth!

178
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,838


179
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,425
So, you saw it! You saw my face
without the false tooth.

180
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,762
I'm relieved. It's only a false tooth.

181
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,890
Nobody has seen me like this before.

182
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,265


183
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,809
I understand. I won't tell anyone! See ya!

184
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,936


185
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,772
Kamalta, knock her down.

186
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:34,527
Enough... is... enough.

187
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,827
I'm really in a hurry.

188
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,372
Are you alright, Miss?

189
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,292
That's the girl. That's the gm
who is extrwrdinarily strung.

190
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,252
Mi as?

191
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,881
Not only did she beat my perfectly
executed move.

192
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,468
She al-so saw me without my false tooth.

193
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,846
Remember me!

194
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,514


195
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,809
Tokuxnaga, I"m going home. I will start
training hard as soon as I get home.

196
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:06,518
Yes!

197
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,104


198
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:13,858
Be happy, Yawum. The rival who will
change your destiny is finally here.

199
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,753
More. more!

200
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:40,135
Miss, miss! Your father sent a few fwrisode. He
says that you should select one that you lilke.

201
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,594
What is it?

202
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,140
l"m taking about furirsodae, New Year's
Day is just around the corner.

203
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,934
Tokunaga. l have more important
things on my mind.

204
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,602
Select an appraprime one far me.

205
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,022
But I can't do ft by myself.

206
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:52,522


207
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,399
How munch was last year's furisode?

208
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,568
It was I! million yen.

209
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,612
Well, this year I will select
a My rnlllllixon yen fulrismde.

210
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:10,415
You've changed. Miss, you're
alive with enthusiasm.

211
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:26,598


212
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,682
This is very delicious

213
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,600


214
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,392
Grandpa.

215
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:40,904


216
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:41,988
You loonk beautiful.

217
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,697


218
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,201
Right? After allv girls Look better in kimono
than in judo uniform, don't they?

219
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:46,743


220
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,955
You look exactly like your grandmother,
Kaneko, when she was young.

221
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,289


222
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,500
Ehh? That wuman. right?

223
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,920


224
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,254
Kaneko was also strong.

225
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,840
She was so strong that I could never beat her.

226
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:00,965


227
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,967
Yawara, you must also be stronger.

228
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,261
I wonder what kind of person grandmother was.

229
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,765


230
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,936
Damn it! As soon as I get out of the hospital,
I catch a cold. I'm so ulnlhucky.

231
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:18,024
Seriously, Matsuda-san. I never thought you had
to go to the hospital for an injury like this.

232
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,444
Idiot! I don't know wha-t you take
me for, but I'm very delicate.

233
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,988


234
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:29,077
If Yawara lnokuma did not come to rescue
me, I might have fallen completely.

235
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,288
But hapless is a newspaper reporter.

236
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:32,706


237
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,209
Immediately after leaving the hospital, you
have to work. And i-t's New Year's Day too.

238
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,502
What can I do?

239
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,797
We learned that Sayaka Honami is coming
to this shrine for the New Year's prayer.

240
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,548


241
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,051
Jeezue. So what if she's the daughter of
the chainrman of the Honami Graup.

242
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:45,427


243
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,096
Rich people who take up sports
are too much for me.

244
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:55,687


245
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,190
If it wasn't for workv I wouldn't
even have to meet the gin.

246
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:10,952
Ma-tsu da-san. . .

247
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:11,202


248
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:15,165
What nonsense! She said that there's no rival
strong enough fm' her. She's so conceited.

249
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:19,502
w-

250
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:24,299
She looks like a snovb and an egoist. She's like
the typical bad girl in a shoujo manga.

251
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:24,591


252
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,427
Who's like the typical bad girl in a shoujo mange?

253
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,596
Which newspaper are you representing?

254
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,099
l-H'm from Every Day Sports daily.

255
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,060
I see, a third-rate news rag.

256
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,353


257
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,312
Go to hell!

258
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,357
May I have one ward from you?

259
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,443
Which sport are you trying to conquer next?

260
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,111


261
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:45,987
It's judo.

262
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:46,905


263
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,323
J... Judo?

264
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:48,907


265
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:54,329
You've been focusing only on fashionable sports.
like riding, gymnastics, fencing; and tennis.

266
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:54,621


267
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,498
Why are you interested in judo now?

268
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,210
That's because I finally found a rival
who can compete with me.

269
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,462
Thafs all for today.

270
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,464
Someone who can compete with you?

271
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,010
It can't be! You aren't talking
about Yawara Inokuma!

272
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,264
How do you know that name?

273
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:17,852


274
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,313
How do you know about Yawara Inokuma?

275
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,400
Do not underestimate a newspaper reporter.

276
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,945
If you're going to Fight with her...

277
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,571


278
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,949
Don't dirty my lS million yen fu'ri-sode, please!

279
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,119
This is going to be very exciting.

280
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,089
I pray that I can find a nice boyfriend this year.

281
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,549


282
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,094
I hope Yawara will make a sensational
debut this year.

283
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,303


284
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:56,224
I hope I will be able to dress up
like an ordinary girl this year.

285
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,270
I hope Yawara will master the secret
principle of juyokugosei this year.

286
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,442
And I hope Yawara will be closer to the Gold
Medal and the National Achievement Award.

287
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:05,942


288
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:06,651
Grandpa!

289
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:19,080


290
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,875
Miss, I think we should stop now.

291
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,375


292
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,295
I don't want to be though-t stingy.
Don't stop things in the middle.

293
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:33,136
Yawara, you are my target this year. I will
demolish you in from: of all of Japan.

294
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,349
Jligoaro lnokurna.

295
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,099


296
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,101
As uaual, you like to make a big show.

297
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,311
Grandrpa!

298
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,645
Yawaara lnokuma.

299
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,231
Sayaka-san, I'm sorry for what
happened the other day.

300
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,649
I see that you fixed the fake booth.

301
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,192


302
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,652
You promised than: you wouldn't
telll anyone about it.

303
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,612


304
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,363
Oh yeah". you're right!

305
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,072


306
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,199
I hope you will pray for your victory.

307
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,491


308
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,450
Grandpa, I'm going.

309
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,538
Those two rub me the wrong way.
Wait and see what PM do.

310
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,958
They will be astonished by my power.

311
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,628


312
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,505
Oh, no. My kimono was slashed.

313
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,174
My kimono was also slashed.

314
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,261
Be careful, Miss. There's a slasher.

315
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,054


316
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:16,930
Everyone's slow.

317
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,263


318
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:21,142
If they were as alert and sharp as I am...

319
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:27,440


320
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,360
Oh. no! My ILS million yen kimono!

321
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,155
Wait!

322
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:38,034


323
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,036
Grandpa, let's go home.

324
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:40,412


325
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,831
l"m drinking the holy sake. Just a minute.

326
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,667
Is this lnokuma-san's grand-daughter?

327
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,419
My, she's grown up.

328
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,380
She used to be like a gobo.

329
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,964


330
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,215
Who's a gnbo?

331
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,883
Waiti

332
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,266
My kimono is not HIKE everyone else's!

333
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,392
Sayaka- Ban .


334
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,198
Splendid. Splendid.

335
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,700
Well done, young girl.

336
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:18,950


337
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,996
Jigoro O'nokuma and Yawara...
I'm gtad that you are here.

338
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,124
Now you know how powerfwl I've become.

339
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:26,583


340
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,502
For such a short period of time,
you've done well. I praise you.

341
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:29,919


342
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,547
After all, you are the "Seven
Star" of the sport world.

343
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:32,797


344
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,174
It's  "Sulper Star".

345
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:34,966


346
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,302
However, your ability isn't extracrdilnzmry.

347
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,304
You and Vawara are like "tsuki to suppon"!



348
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:43,641
If: a tie. l"mrnnt as strong
as you are, Sayaka-sam

349
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,229
This is a good opportunity. Let's have
a match here, Yawara lnoKu-ma.

350
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:48,730


351
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,399
I don't want to. We're wearing formal kimono.

352
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:51,733


353
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,819
It's such a cheap kirrnnono. I
can buy a new one for you.

354
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,070


355
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,321
It's not a cheap kimono.

356
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:56,529


357
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,281
Miss, your back. Your back.

358
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,574
What about my back?

359
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,368
Don't mess with me!

360
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,202


361
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,413
Thia is terrible. Pulilce. We must call the police.

362
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,790


363
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,875
Well, what are you going to do. Miss?

364
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,542


365
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,335
Sa'yaka- san .

366
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:10,794


367
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:16,383
D-Dun't give me a hand. I can manage
by myself, without your help.

368
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:16,508


369
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,092
What did you say?

370
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,802


371
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,263
Sayakat-san, twist the hand holding
the knife the other way around.

372
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,725
I... I Know that. This way.

373
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:26,893
You rascal!

374
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:33,817
I cant watch! If your face gets damaged, it
will be worse than your false tooth fayhl'ilng.

375
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,944
D-Don't talk about that!

376
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,656
Yonu are so troublesome.

377
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:41,574
Who are you?

378
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:42,784
Don't come closer.

379
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,329
I'm telling you not to come any closer.

380
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,250
Don't!

381
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:58,758
You bitch!

382
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:10,812


383
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,313
Sayaka-sann, I'll hand over the baton to you.

384
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:12,981


385
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:13,481
H:uh ?

386
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,274


387
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,152
Hold him tight so that he
will not attack wu again.

388
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:17,861
Yes.

389
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:22,323


390
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:26,453
If you act like a tombcry, even when you're all
dressed up, you'Ll never meet a nice guy.

391
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:26,995


392
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:27,537
Hluh ?

393
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,288


394
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:34,586
Now you see how strong Yawara is.
Reach her level as soon as possible.

395
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,549
Oh my goodness, I got my kilmuonno all dirty.

396
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,346
Yawalra Inclkuma. ..

397
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:48,558

00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,398



401
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,901
Of course. I'm not a peaceful person like this.

402
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,864
Camera, cameri This is a scoop!

403
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:03,323
Yes .

404
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,248
I'm ashamed of this.

405
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,043
Miss, that is your valuable achievement,

406
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:23,259
Yawara lnokuma, if you ever meet
that 'nice guy'. Remember this...

00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,553


408
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,846
The rival has debuted.

409
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:33,019
Yawara will make a sensational debut toward
the gold medal and the award.

410
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,229


411
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,898
Grandpa, how many rice cakes do
you want in your ozoni soup?

412
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,775

00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:39,359
Okay.

414
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,302
With the appearance of a rival for Yawanra,
the story is getting interesting.

415
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:10,390
I don't thrink i-t's interesting.
I'm never practice judo.

416
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,892
All I want is to fa.ll iIn have like everyone else.

417
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:13,351
It's not possible.

We'll see. I feel I will meet someone
wonderful in the next episode.

W'ha-t's the matter with you, Yawara, to
be infatuated with the idea of love?

423
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,072
