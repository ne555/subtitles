1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,600
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,500
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,900
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,400
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,300
Superidol Surfaces!

10
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Hon'ami Sayaka's coach ippon-zeoi.
ippon-zeoi--one arm shoulder flip

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,200
Yawara

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,100
Inokuma Yawara (17 years old)

13
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,900
Yawara-san, when did you first begin judo?

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,900
What are your 3 sizes? [bust, waist, hip]


15
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,800
And do you sleep in pajamas or-- ?

16
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Please! Let me through!

17
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,400
You've learned judo from your grandfather,
so what do the practices consist of?

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
Like, playing the piano with 
your toes or something?

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,500
Please get out of my way!

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,700
Look this way!

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,300
Get the hell out of here, you scumbags!

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,900
If you lay even one finger on
this child, I will get you!

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
Yawara, go!

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
Ya... Yawara-san!

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,500
Ahh, oh well. Then please say 
something, grandfather.

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,000
When is she doing an official match?

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,900
What are Yawara-san's practices like?

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,700
It's... LOVE!

29
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,400
Hah?

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:40,300
Education is when the teacher and the learner both value and respect each other. It's only natural to have sympathy rub off.




31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,500
And so, this is one form of...

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
LOVE!



33
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,500
Hah?

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,100
The way Kaneko and I united 
was because of true love.

35
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,600
It was during the depressing times 
right before the 2.26 incident, jyatta.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
...jyatta... eh?

37
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I was a young martial arts lad trying to 
be Japan's best and Kaneko was also...

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,100
Hey wait up, gramps!

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Don't try to fake us out!

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,900
Yeah, yeah!

41
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
We were both attracted to each other...

42
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
We were both attracted to each other...
Come on, gramps!

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,200
Come on, gramps!

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Ka... Kaneko!

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,800
It turned out to be one heck of 
a mob, huh, Matsuda-san?

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah.

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,200
If the media is stirring it up this much, 
they can't keep it a secret anymore.

48
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:40,200
Yawara! Episode 7
Hohohoh! The Yawara Boom
That Shakes Japan, Jya!

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Inokuma, you're so cool!

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm surprised you're so strong!

51
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,950
Hey, famous person!

52
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,200
Try a throw for us!

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,300
It's not true!

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Nope, it's definitely you!

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,300
Yeah!

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Quit lying, even your full name 
and school is mentioned here.

57
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,000
Stop it. Yawara can't possibly do such a thing!


58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,300
Y... yeah. And she has a 
smaller arm than me!

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,900
Then, let's try and test her here!

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,100
Lay off!

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
If you mess with Yawara, I will get you!


62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,600
Dammit! Hey, let's everyone get her!

63
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,200
Yeah!

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,900
That's enough!

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Hanazono-kun.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,500
You guys! How could you guys 
gang up on a helpless girl?

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,900
This is... this is not what a 
fellow student should do!

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,600
I am extremely saddened by this fact!

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,400
If you say anything more 
stupid, I'll attend to you!

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,700
We were only kidding!

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Y... yeah, you don't need to cry over it!

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,200
Get the hell out of here!

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Hanazono-kun.

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,900
W... well, you know...

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,700
I... Inokuma, if you ever need 
anything, just call me.

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,700
Well then...

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
My life is so screwed up!

78
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,300
Ahh! Him!

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,300
Yeah, that's right, it's all that newspaper reporter, Matsuda's fault!

80
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,500
Ever since he appeared, 
nothing has gone right.

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,700
Hey! Don't space out during class!

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry, sir.

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
I... Inokuma!

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,300
Oh, it was you, Inokuma.

85
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,700
I hit you without knowing.

86
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
My bad, my bad, Hahahah!

87
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,800
U...uhm, my home loan's been 
only paid half a year now and...

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,100
What page do I need to read, sir?

89
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,900
Ahh! I'm sorry, I have a wife and kids! 
Don't kill me with an ippon-zeoi!
Please! Please! Please!
ippon-zeoi--one arm shoulder throw

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:13,300
Hey, why did things turn out like this? There's no way Yawara can do judo, you know.

91
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,400
Yeah.. but the more I look at it, 
she really looks like Yawara.

92
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,000
Eh?


93
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,900
But, it could just be a stranger really closely resembling you, so cheer up, Yawara!

94
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,300
It's okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,100
The media really likes these kinds of things!

96
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,600
"The Hidden Abilities of Today's
High-school Gals!"

97
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,800
That's perverted!

98
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
What's going to happen to me now?

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,600
But, but Kazamatsuri-san... 
why were you with me?

100
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,400
Is it really for spying on me?

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,800
Or is it...?

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,700
Don't kid me!

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,200
Today's lunch menu is ocean
turtle soup, lamb steak...

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,400
But, isn't this Yawara-san a 
very formidable opponent?

105
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Uhm... fois de gras caviar...

106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm sick of fois de gras, discard it.

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,300
Yes, ma'am.

108
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,300
Inokuma Yawara has no status now, so
the story won't be exciting unless she's handled extravagantly by the media.

109
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,300
For dessert, we have foreign
pear sherbert cake..

110
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,700
For dessert, we have foreign
pear sherbert cake..
So, this is all your doing, Sayaka-san?

111
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,200
So, this is all your doing, Sayaka-san?

112
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Of course!

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
From your previous TV 
comments to this incident?

114
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,300
All according to my plans.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,900
The more the public fevers over her, 
the more it's worth throwing her!

116
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,900
I see! But don't worry, everyone in the
public is on your side, Sayaka-san!

117
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Compared to that disgustingly
LOW-LEVEL character throwing
the opponent's coach, that is!

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
My! Oh-hohohohoh!

119
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,500
Inokuma Yawara!

120
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Matsuda-chan, you're great! 
I like you, I really like you!

121
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,000
Because of your scoop, Matsuda-chan,
our newspaper is the talk of town 
and our sales are through the roof!

122
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,600
I believed that Matsuda-chan, you 
would definitely... definitely
accomplish great things for us!

123
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,200
Hey, someone... someone get 
some tea for Matsuda-chan!

124
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,200
I've been waiting a long time for this moment! Today's such a wonderful day!

125
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,150
If it's a dream, I don't ever want to wake up.

126
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
The tea's going to get cold...

127
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,900
Ohh, we're going to Takotsubo-ten tonight!

128
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Is it your tab, sir?

129
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,300
Of course!

130
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,400
All right!

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,200
Kazamatsuri-san, I want to see you...

132
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,500
See you and know your true feelings...

133
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,300
You're Yawara-san, right?

134
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Excuse me! Yawara-san!

135
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,400
When is your debut match?

136
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Please get out of my way!

137
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Why were you hiding yourself all this time?

138
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,600
What's your relationship with Hon'ami Sayaka?

139
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,950
Nothing!

140
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,700
What about Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke?

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,200
Geez!

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Hey! Don't touch Inokuma!

143
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,920
Help me! Help me!

144
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,500
Yawara-san, get on, quick!

145
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,900
Hurry!

146
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,450
Kazamatsuri-san!

147
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh no! Inokuma Yawara has 
been kidnapped! Chase her!

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Don't kid me! Why do I have 
to do a press interview?

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Tokunaga, have them vacate the premise.

150
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,700
Yes, ma'am!

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,600
You can't go out in public after 
having this embarrassing photo,
right, Kazamatsuri-san?

152
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,200
Exactly!

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,900
I was thrown so well to the 
point of embarrassment.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,600
That shows how sharp and 
precise her technique was.


155
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,300
A very skilled swordsman is known 
to cut the opponent without giving 
any time for them to feel any pain.

156
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,900
Those thrown by her will 
learn that the hard way.

157
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,200
You can't defeat her, the skill
difference is too much.

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,900
No, no, no! No way! I will 
beat her somehow!

159
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,800
There's never been anything 
I couldn't get before!

160
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,700
I will definitely steal victory away from her!

161
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,730
And, and, and... get you, too!

162
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,700
No, nothing... really.

163
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,700
If there is a way, there is just 
one way to win against her.

164
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
And that is?

165
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,700
To get the master, Inokuma Jigoro, the 
7th degree black belt, as YOUR coach.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,900
I'm 8TH degree, Jya!

167
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,150
Hang on tight!

168
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,600
Eh?

169
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
I said hang on tight!

170
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,700
Okay!

171
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,100
As I said before many times...

172
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,730
There's no way that Yawara 
can throw a man!

173
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,800
One more question, do you know
where she is? Did she come here?

174
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,900
I don't know, okay?

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You shouldn't hide things from us. 
Isn't she in your house?

176
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,400
I said I don't know! Go home!

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,300
If you see her, call us.

178
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,400
How persistent! Go home!

179
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
Kaori's house is probably no good, either.

180
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,100
Ahh! That motorcycle! 
It's Inokuma Yawara!

181
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh shoot!

182
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,700
Wait, wait!

183
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,000
I was suspicious about you, Kazamatsuri-san.

185
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I thought you were trying to figure
me out, like everyone else.

186
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:06,100
I even thought you were Sayaka-san's
spy. But.. since you did all this 
for me Kazamatsuri-san...

187
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm really sorry, Kazamatsuri-san... Ahh!

188
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm sorry I'm not Kazamatsuri.

189
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,200
I don't know what's between you
and him, but it's not my style to 
impose on your private life.

190
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,200
I'll ignore what you just said.

191
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,300
I'm going home!

192
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,300
Going home?

193
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,000
W... wait, where do you think you're going?

194
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,700
Let me go!

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,800
If you go home now, you can't do anything!

196
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,900
All this is your fault!

197
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,500
Is it all my fault?

198
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,700
Yeah, it's ALL your fault!

199
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh yeah? Yeah! Okay! It's all my fault!

200
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
What are you trying to say
now? Just let me go!

201
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,400
No!

202
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,400
Let me go!

203
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,800
Just calm down now!

204
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,400
Geez!

205
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Don't ever come before me again!

206
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,100
A... awesome!


207
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,700
It was way beyond my expectations! 
She threw me without using any power.

208
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,300
If it's her, she can do it... the gold medal 
and the National Achievement Award!

209
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,800
But...

210
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,800
Ah! Oww, oww!

211
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,500
Are you okay?

212
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,500
No, not really good. Oww!

213
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,000
Any injuries? Broken bones?

214
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,100
My whole's body's rattled, so I'm not sure.

215
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,900
Sorry.

216
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,400
Instead of me, we should be concerned
with your situation, since you have
no place to return to.

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Oww, oww, oww!

218
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,200
Who is it?

219
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:10,500
Mm? Who is it? Wait, I've heard that cutsey voice somewhere before... hold on...

220
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,100
And, these adorably soft, maple
leaf handy-wandies...

221
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,800
I know... it must be Sayaka-chan!

222
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,500
No fun, no fun, no fun!

223
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:29,100
I tried really hard to fool you but you saw through it too quickly, daddy-waddy! I hate you!

224
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,300
I'm in trouble. What should 
I do to make it up?

225
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Try and guess!

226
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,000
Well.. let's see, something that'd
make my Sayaka happy...

227
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,600
I bought you 10 fur items recently, 
and you've got a boatload of jewelry,

228
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,800
you have 5 cars, and 3 yachts... 
oh, I know... airplanes!

229
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
You want an airplane, right, Sayaka?

230
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
No, no!

231
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,000
Actually,

232
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,700
I want one old person!

233
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Old person?

234
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,100
Yes, a terrific old person! A judo master!

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
W... well, come on in!

236
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,800
I cleaned this place just last month. 
This is a little bearable, right?

237
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,200
People need to bear through things, you know?

238
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,600
I... I'll make a spot for you 
here, so hang on a sec.

239
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Ahh, no, no, no! It's okay, don't worry!

240
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,800
Who is that?

241
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Rikido-zan... the pro wrestler, Rikido-zan.

242
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,400
And this person?

243
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,400
Nagashima! You don't know him?

244
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,300
Ah, this is Yamashita athlete, right?

245
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,100
Yeah!

246
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Ahh!

247
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm not using this for weird 
things... don't worry!

248
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,700
They're all weird posters.

249
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,900
What do you mean? They're 
all superstars of the era!

250
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:18,200
Taking a small possible situation, tying it 
to a sure chance, and grabbing the glory.
They all made my dreams come true!




251
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,500
And one day, you, too, will...

252
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
No, not me.

253
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,800
What is she doing out still?

254
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Uhm, hello...

255
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:48,100
Pin pon pan pon! This number is no
longer in service, so... excuse me!

256
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,200
Ahh, you're Jigoro-san, correct?

257
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm fine, thank you. Excuse me!

258
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
W... wait, Jigoro-sama!

259
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,000
Excuse me!

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Jigoro-sensei!

261
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,200
Yes, what?

262
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,000
No way, this my room?

263
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Okay, next is dinner prep.

264
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,300
Ah, it's okay, there's a good ramen 
shop just around the corner.

265
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,300
You probably eat ramen all time, right?

266
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,900
Eh?


267
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Are there any grocery shops nearby?

268
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,300
Yeah, there's a convenience store...

269
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,400
I'll make you beef stroganoff.

270
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,200
B... beef stroga.. what's that?

271
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
A thank you gift for today.

272
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,300
Hey, what's this car? Don't push, man!

273
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,200
Which newspaper company is it?

274
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,900
Stupid, it can't be a newspaper company!


275
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,340
News reporters, great job, great job.

276
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,300
I am here to escort you.

277
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
Inokuma-san, where are you going?

278
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,400
I've been invited to dinner. What 
was it that's being served?

279
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,500
A bit of French cuisine, sire.

280
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,700
A bit, a bit! I'm eating that.

281
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,700
Delicious! This is really delicious! We should've called your grandfather over!


282
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,100
What's wrong, aren't you gonna eat? If 
you don't eat, you won't become strong!

283
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,900
I don't care about getting strong.

284
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,900
When did you start doing judo?

285
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,700
I don't know...

286
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,900
But, I do remember stomach throwing
my father when I was 5 years old.

287
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,430
5 years old?!

288
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,500
I wanted to be praised by everyone.

289
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:48,900
Of course, grandpa was overjoyed, but at 
that time, it seemed like my mother was 
in the shadows of the dojo, crying.

290
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,800
At that time, I had no idea that 
I was different than other kids.

291
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,400
But, my mother must have known.

292
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,800
When I got in junior high, I finally noticed it.


293
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,600
All my friends weren't doing 
morning and night practices.

294
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:16,100
Everyone wore pretty clothes, 
and dated boys, having fun...

295
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,100
While only I... only I...

296
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:31,400
I don't hate judo. But, I just want to 
be a normal girl... just a normal girl.

297
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:44,100
I... I don't know how many times I cried...
for exactly the opposite reason.

298
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,200
I told you before, right, that my 
dream was a sports star.

299
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:55,900
A sports star that gave everyone a chance
to dream... that's what I wanted to be.

300
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:07,200
Baseball, soccer, rugby... I did all 
kinds, but none of them clicked.

301
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,900
In the end, I always cried... it was rough, you know, to give up each dream, one by one.

302
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,200
Ah, heck! All of that is history!

303
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,100
I'm pretty satisfied now, with being a newspaper reporter. People are strange, huh?

304
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,000
This is delicious!



305
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
Ahh, I'll clean it up!

306
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

307
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
Really, you can just leave it there...

308
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,700
Eeek!

309
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,200
What?

310
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,700
A c... cockroach just...

311
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,700
Eeek... ran.. it ran...

312
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,600
A cockroach ran! Gross!

313
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,100
She really is just a normal girl.

314
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,500
What are you doing? Please 
hurry up and catch it!

315
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
What, me?

316
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,900
Ah, don't tell me that you're afraid of cockroaches, too, Matsuda-san!

317
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,100
Wha... no way, it's just a cockroach...

318
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,000
Dohhyah!

319
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,400
The cockroach flew!

320
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
Another plateful!

321
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,000
U... uhm... Inokuma-sensei.

322
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,500
Hm?

323
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,600
Isn't it time to discuss being 
Sayaka's coach...

324
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,100
Don't sweat it.

325
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,900
Hah...

326
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,100
But...

327
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,030
But this food is really delicious. 
Another plateful, jya!

328
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,200
The fifth helping... right?

329
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,800
What a grand person!

330
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
The boldness of requesting seconds 
at a prestigious restaurant!

331
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,200
This is a challenge to the weight-classes
and rules and manners of the 
Japanese Judo Federation!

332
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,900
He can do it! The master will definitely bring about a revolution in the Japanese judo world!

333
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,300
Another plateful, please!

334
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,800
971 days until Barcelona Olympics

335
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,300
Hey, Grandpa, are you really going
to be Sayaka-san's coach?

336
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,500
This is tasty, too. Yawara, I 
want more kimpira goboh!

337
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,800
Geez... Grandpa, I'm going to be in a match.

338
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,400
W... what did you say?

339
