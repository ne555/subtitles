1
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,760
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,160
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,560
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,760
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,360
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:03,460
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,860
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,370
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,280
It's a queen!

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,430
What does it mean?

11
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,010
Be quiet!

12
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,660
Yawara Inokuma, you will meet a 
gorgeous man within 24 hours.

13
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,080
She said within 24 hours.

14
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,350
No way! Yawara will find a boyfriend
before me!? No way! No way! No way!

15
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,270
I beg you, read my fortune next.

16
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,580
Mine, mine!

17
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,520
You did it!

18
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,470
It's amazing, Yawara.

19
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,210
Now way. No way. No way.

20
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,700
Now way. No way. No way.
Let's go.

21
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:17,960
Let's go.

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,470
Oops, I made a mistake! There are 
two cards sticking together.

23
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,840
No way!

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,240
Episode 3
Enter Kazamatsuri. What a shame 
that she is infatuated with love.

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,130
See ya, Yawara.

26
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,550
I hope you'll do well in the 
English test tomorrow.

27
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,460
Yawara, if you meet the gorgeous 
man, be sure to tell us.

28
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,890
It's been a long time, 
Miss Yawara Inokuma.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,270
Wh... Who are you?

30
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,620
Oh yes. I've never introduced myself to you.

31
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,300
I'm Matsuda from Every Sports Daily.

32
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,280
Y... You are?

33
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,090
Yes... I'm Matsuda who reported your great tomoenage and showed your panties.


34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,040
Also, I was saved by you when I was almost smashed by a group of delinquent boys.

35
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,410
In other words, I know you better 
than anyone else in mass media.

36
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,750
I don't know what you're talking about.


37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,160
Come, come. You're pretending 
that you don't know!

38
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,810
I'm trying to memorize English 
vocabularies. Please be quiet!

39
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,060
Even if you pretend, I have proof.

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,730
You must be on special judo training 
by the 7th dan master, Inokuma,
ever since you were young.

41
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,470
Unrelated - nothing to do with! 
False charge - an unjust accusation!

42
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,530
Why!? Why don't you make a debut in
the judo world when you are so skilled?

43
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,070
Why are you trying to hide your talent?

44
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,100
I'll cry out! - I'll make a big noise!

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,000
I beg of you! Please answer me, 
even if it's just one word!

46
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm betting my "reporter's life" on you.

47
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,190
Please leave me alone!

48
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,080
What's this? Kyoko's prediction is off the mark.

49
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,020
That's enough, you molester. Leave her alone.

50
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,050
I'm just gathering data on her.

51
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,030
You have no right to violate her 
privacy and to collect material.

52
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,690
It's OK now. You don't 
need to worry anymore.

53
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,370
Yes.

54
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,640
He's so cool. Kyoko's prediction 
may be on the mark.

55
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,920
Who is that man?

56
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,930
Really, thank you very much.

57
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,350
Don't mention it. By the way,
are you feeling better now?

58
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,230
Yes!

59
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,870
Wow! This is the first time 
I'm in a cafe with a man.

60
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,660
Waiter. A cake for her. How about 
Charlotte Bois and tea?

61
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,630
I'll get it immediately, sir.

62
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,280
Is that man a reporter from a photo magazine?

63
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:26,940
What!?

64
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,150
No... I thought you may be a popular idol singer or something that was being followed.

65
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,190
An idol? Me!? No, not at all!

66
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,990
I'm also invading your privacy.

67
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,360
That's only because you're dazzling!

68
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,970
I... I... I am!?

69
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,950
Yes. You have something special.

70
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,270
You have some kind of magnetic
power that pulls people to you, 
like the gravitational force of stars.

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,640
I've never gotten this kind of 
compliment from men.

72
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,220
He said I'm dazzling.

73
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,740
I have something special.

74
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:25,930
I'm home.

75
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,130
Uncle Uomata, what's the matter with you?

76
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,530
Yawara, help me.

77
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,180
He has a minor disc problem.

78
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,250
Stop being a cry baby. 
You're a grown-up man.

79
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,800
What are you watching? 
We should start our lesson.

80
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,570
Change your clothes and 
wait for me in the drill hall.

81
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,040
Yes.

82
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,930
Oh, oh, did I do too much?

83
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,550
Yawara, why are you in a daze?

84
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,470
How many times do I have to tell you that an unguarded moment may cost you your life?

85
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,900
But, grandpa...

86
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,820
There are no but's or anything!


87
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,230
Your eyes tell me that you are in love again.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,280
If you have time to think about a 
worthless fellow, polish your skills.

89
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,540
If you do, you can get everything.

90
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,700
The Gold Medal, the National Achievement Award, and even men.

91
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,870
Get?

92
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,160
We're not talking about things.

93
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,230
Love should be pure.


94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,140
You can't have love in such 
a calculating manner.

95
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,080
You've become argumentative.

96
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,540
I, too, tasted the sweets and bitters of life.

97
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,720
When I met Kaneko, it was just before the 2.26 incident. It was a very unsettling time.


98
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,360
In those days, all young men 
were sincere. Not like today!


99
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,030
It was a time when true love existed.

100
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,710
I... I know. Once you start the story, 
it takes more than two to three hours...

101
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,610
I was a handsome and bright young man who wanted to be number one in judo in Japan.

102
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,260
I... I understand. Let's start our lesson.

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,990
Kaneko and I fell in love at first sight...

104
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,120
Each other at first sight...

105
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,810
Each other...

106
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,940
Each other...

107
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,910
Will I meet him again?


108
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,510
Kazamatsuri. This is Yurie. You're always out.

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,870
The next time I see you, I'll pinch you.

110
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,840
Shinnosuke. It's me. Akina.

111
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,300
I've reserved a room in the hotel we 
stayed at last time. Call me.

112
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:50,700
I'm your Maiko. If you don't call me, I'll have
an affair with someone. It's a lie!

113
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,990
This is Minako. Don't you like me anymore?

114
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,490
I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself.

115
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,690
Shin-chan. This is Shizuka. You were great the other day. Let's do it again soon.

116
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,380
Why is the big city lonely in the night time?



117
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,160
Sayaka, how confident are you?

118
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,300
Is your objective to win the title?

119
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,830
Why judo now?

120
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,700
Please give me your answer. 
One word will do. One word.

121
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,350
With a full-fledged technique...


122
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,660
I plan to win the championship with 
full-fledged points all the way.

123
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,560
She's making a big splash again.

124
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,600
Hey, Yawara, it's about to begin.

125
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,650
What will start?

126
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,970
Didn't you read the newspaper? Sayaka Honami will make a debut in judo.

127
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,190
Is that so?


128
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,290
What are you saying? Your 
rival is on television.

129
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,280
Grandpa, you made her my rival for your 
own accord without my consent.

130
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,610
Why are you hiding your happiness?

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,030
I'm not hiding anything.

132
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
I know how you must feel.

133
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,970
You must be irritated because your
rival made her debut before you.

134
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,930
You still don't understand.

135
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,330
A 48 kilo or less class title 
match is about to start.

136
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,710
The topic of this match is how 
skillful Sayaka Honami will be.

137
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,660
The sports genius who has conquered almost all types of sports will now take on judo.

138
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,080
The sports genius who has conquered almost all types of sports will now take on judo.
She's really ostentatious.

139
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,790
The sports genius who has conquered almost all types of sports will now take on judo.

140
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,540
The sports genius who has conquered almost all types of sports will now take on judo.
Your debut must be better than hers.

141
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,530
Your debut must be better than hers.

142
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,320
Before the match starts, 
here is an announcement.

143
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,020
Rapidly developing Honami Group.

144
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,850
The Honami Group is for the 21st Century.

145
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,410
Incredible! They are taking 
advantage of each other.

146
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,310
The first opponent for Honami Sayaka is Nagasaki Hisako, who was the runner-up 
at the last All Japan Championship.

147
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,920
I did not take up judo 
to fight with small fry.

148
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,840
Start!

149
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,940
I want to beat you, Yawara Inokuma.

150
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,540
OK, I decided. Beef Stroganoff. Let's go with it.

151
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,610
Hey, Yawara! Where are you going?

152
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,540
To the kitchen.

153
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,740
To the kitchen?

154
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,850
Haraigoshi for Sayaka Honami.

155
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,740
She started the first match with an easy victory against a strong opponent. Sayaka is strong!


156
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,530
Did you see that, Yawara Inokuma?

157
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,840
This is the result of my hard training.

158
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,210
Tokunaga...

159
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,390
My judo suit has some wrinkles.

160
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,210
I want to change into a fresh one. 
Please get it ready.

161
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,780
Yes!

162
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,310
I need to make some preparation. 
Some pepper on the beef...

163
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,990
After all, a girl has to learn to cook, right?

164
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,960
Because you're dazzling...

165
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,430
... you have something special...

166
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,680
I'll definitely make a delicious dish.

167
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,470
Fierce ashibarai, continue!

168
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,560
Watch me with your...

169
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,040
Oosotogari. Honami shaky.

170
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,460
Tomoenage.

171
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,820
Without a doubt. Sayaka Honami 
won the second match easily.

172
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,710
Are you surprised, Yawara Inokuma?

173
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,560
You must be shocked by my powers.

174
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,160
Tokunaga, I perspired a little.

175
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,050
I want to change into a new suit. 
Get it ready immediately!

176
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:55,850
Yes.

177
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,100
Yawara Inokuma. If you feel chagrin, come out.

178
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,620
Ippon!


179
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,930
She won.

180
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,480
She won the championship in the 
48 kilo or less class match.

181
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,510
She's quite proficient. I'm convinced
that she has an excellent coach.

182
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,470
I must compliment myself. I made a
delicious Beef Stroganoff dish.

183
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,680
I wish I could serve this dish to him, 
but I didn't even ask him his name.

184
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,920
This is the announcer.

185
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,390
Everyone is chanting Sayaka here!

186
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,290
Now I would like to get a victorious comment from the winner, Sayaka Honami.

187
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,810
Congratulations.

188
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,220
Some comments...

189
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,450
Some comments, please.

190
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,320
This is an empty victory.

191
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,170
Ah, surely it isn't...

192
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,950
You have taken the judo championship.

193
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,600
You would not win and then retire, would you?

194
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,260
Usually I would do that...

195
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,000
... but this is not a real victory.

196
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,310
This is not a real victory!?

197
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,730
No, I have not fought with a 
truly strong opponent.

198
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:34,750
But you beat last year's winner, 
Kaoru Yamada, today.

199
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,990
You're irritating me. Let me use your microphone. I don't need you.

200
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,600
Please...

201
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,620
Camera one, and camera two.

202
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,360
Close in on me.

203
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,340
That's good.

204
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,660
Take a good shot of me.

205
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,430
Are you watching Yawara-san?

206
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,590
I just won the judo tournament!

207
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,460
You're suffering, aren't you, Yawara?

208
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,620
Yawara, if you're regretting what you have seen, come out soon. I will not dodge.

209
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,350
I decided to take up judo to 
fight only with you because...

210
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,590
... I want to knock you down.

211
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,250
This is something.

212
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,650
I can't believe it.

213
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,210
Yawara, it's a great challenge from her. 
What are you going to do?

214
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,560
You're not joking! She has no right to mention my name on television without my consent.

215
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,240
Honami-san, who is Yawara?

216
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,800
Is she stronger than you?


217
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,290
If you are in the mass media business, 
you should find the person by yourself.

218
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,710
Now excuse me, everyone.

219
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,000
Sayaka-san became strong.

220
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,030
Do you recall the man who was 
accompanying her during the match?

221
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,130
He's the one who helped her win.

222
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,910
That handsome guy?

223
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,050
That's him. He's the one who 
threw me out of the bus.

224
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,290
I checked his background carefully.

225
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,930
His name is Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke.

226
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,220
He became her coach.

227
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,200
Sayaka-san gave us the slip...

228
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,680
Let's get the coach...

229
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,920
Is he a great coach?

230
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,880
I've never heard of his name before.

231
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,730
He's one of the best in Japan...

232
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,090
... but he has never won in a real match.

233
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,310
Not even one victory? Why is that?

234
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,020
Is it delicious?

235
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,280
Jeez, if you have time to cook this beef-over-rice dish, then why 
don't you practice judo?

236
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,350
It's not a beef-over-rice dish. 
It is called Beef Stroganoff.

237
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,510
What's shironge pongo?


238
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,670
Jeez! How does it taste?

239
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,520
While your rival hired an excellent 
coach and won the championship, 
you are leisurely cooking.

240
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,520
If you're only going to complain, 
you don't have to eat it.

241
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,140
If you're only going to complain, 
you don't have to eat it.
Wait! I'm still eating! Hey... Hey...

242
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,790
Wait! I'm still eating! Hey... Hey...

243
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,030
I didn't make this for you.

244
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,970
What! The coach has disappeared too!

245
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,580
Look for him! Look for him! Damn!

246
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,880
I can't handle it...

247
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,040
The press interviews...

248
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,020
Nervousness?

249
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,060
In front of people, he becomes
completely different.

250
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,870
When it comes to an actual match, he cannot demonstrate his real strength.

251
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,800
I can't believe it. Something is wrong.

252
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,910
As you see, he's trying to 
hide from the reporters.

253
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,610
I guess you're right.

254
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:35,120
This should be destroyed this way! 
Th... th... this way!

255
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,630
Tokunaga, clean up this mess.

256
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,710
Miss, the well-deserved trophy...

257
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,100
This is junk!

258
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,640
Without beating Yawara Inokuma, how can I treat this as the trophy for the victory for me?

259
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,240
Why are you so irritated, Sayaka?

260
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,930
When it comes to Yawara Inokuma, 
you lose control completely.


261
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,040
You have demonstrated the ability to beat 
the winner of All Japan Championship
Match under my guidance.

262
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,830
I think you are invincible.

263
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,120
You're not serious.

264
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,420
It's like eating yokan while
sipping redbean soup.

265
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,680
You can say that since you don't know 
how strong Yawara Inokuma is.

266
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,720
Sayaka-san, I heard that you've actually 
seen her strength only twice.

267
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,480
How can you conclude 
that she's so strong?

268
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,630
It's my intuition.

269
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,650
The perception that is felt only 
between two strong opponents.

270
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,070
I see... I think I know how you feel.

271
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,210
The other day I sensed a similar 
feeling with someone.

272
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,930
I would very much like to meet 
Yawara Inokuma.

273
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,530
It's no use. Usually, she does 
not show her ability.

274
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,000
You're not jealous of Yawara because
I want to meet her, are you?

275
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,820
N.. no way! What are you talking about?

276
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
Tokunaga, give him her address.

277
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,580
Yes!

278
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,450
He was not on the bus today!

279
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,440
I didn't get his name nor his
telephone number. I'm helpless.

280
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,680
I must be out of practice of this kind because my grandpa forces me to practice judo.

281
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,070
That's right. Grandpa is to be blamed.

282
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,520
Ah! I'm sorry!

283
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,480
It's dangerous. Don't do that.

284
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,070
What a coincidence. I thought 
I might meet you again.

285
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,700
What are you doing around here?

286
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,300
Err... Some errand.

287
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,480
If you like, would you like to come 
to my house for a cup of tea?

288
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,370
You saved me from the newspaper 
reporter the other day and today 
I kicked a can at you... and...

289
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,190
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet. 
My name is Shinnosuke Kazamatsuri.

290
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,100
Kazamatsuri-san?

291
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,010
Ahh, this is my house.

292
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,240
This is a lovely house. Oh.. Inokuma?

293
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,710
I am Inokuma. Please come in.

294
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,650
Yawara, are you home?

295
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,440
Ah, grandpa.

296
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,150
Yawara? This is Yawara Inokuma!?

297
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,940
Grandpa, we have a guest.

298
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,970
A guest?

299
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,760
This old man is...?


300
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,320
I am Jigoro Inokuma. How do you do?

301
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,620
Ah! Inokuma-san!

302
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,180
I need to excuse myself today.

303
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,140
Oh, yes! Let's meet Saturday at 3 o'clock 
at the shop we went to the other day.

304
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,700
That's better. Let's do that.

305
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,140
Kazamatsuri-san.

306
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,690
See ya!

307
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,530
How odd, I've seen that face somewhere.

308
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,820
Grandpa, you should not display 
thing like that in front of him.

309
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,530
I finally meet the master, Jigoro Inokuma.

310
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,090
When I was young, I decided to dedicate 
myself to judo after I read this book.

311
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:28,640
Even now, I always keep this book 
with me, Judo is not build in a day.

312
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,070
I got nervous. Damn!

313
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:43,870
I now know why Sayaka Honami wants 
to make the girl and the 7th dan master
Jigoro Inokuma as her opponents.

314
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,530
I'm the 8th dan master.

315
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:02,030
999 more days till the Olympics in Barcelona

316
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,240
I'm in high spirits. I have a date tomorrow.

317
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,120
Yawara, why are you so excited?

318
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,390
Yawara, why are you so excited?
NO! Grandpa, you're a pervert. You are 
the lowest to peep into a bathroom.

319
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,890
NO! Grandpa, you're a pervert. You are 
the lowest to peep into a bathroom.

320
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:18,460
She hasn't learned from past lessons
and is meeting a man again.

321
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,410
Grandpa, you are not 
scheming again, are you?

322
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,240
On the next Yawara.

323
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,940
The strategy to make Yawara participate in a real match. This is my strategy. Don't miss it.
