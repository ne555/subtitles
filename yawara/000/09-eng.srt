00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,400
Translator's Notes:
The ice cream shop "Golgo 13 ice cream" is a spoof of Baskin Robins. Golgo 13 ran in the same anthology book as Yawara, so the artist spoofed his peer's comic. (Common practice among Japanese cartoonists.)

it was you that I clearly saw.

That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,900
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,400
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

16
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,110
Even if you stay hidden, 
things like that will continue.

17
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,120
What... should I do? I can't 
be outside anymore.

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Well, then, you'll have to go public.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,410
Wh... what?

20
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,840
Do a match and...

21
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,010
LOSE in front of everybody!

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,140
Episode 9
Yawara's Debut Match! An Ippon Victory Before You Even Knew It Happened! Jya!

23
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,530
Next!

24
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,470
Hey, today's Miss Sayaka is...

25
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,450
Pretty ticked off, huh?

26
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,880
Did you say something?

27
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,410
Uh no! Such wonderful skills! Truly splendid!

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,260
I am, aren't I?

29
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,140
Since I became so powerful, all I need to do 
is defeat Yawara Inokuma and live up to my reputation of being Japan's number one.

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,820
But, why... why, Yawara Inokuma?

31
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,050
Why do you avoid me and instead, 
do such a meaningless match?

32
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,060
"Yawara" finally debuts! 
At the Saikai College Judo Hall!
Opponent is over 20 kg heavier, Yuki Tohdoh!

33
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,370
As the person thrown by Yawara 
Inokuma, Coach Kazamatsuri, what 
are your feelings about this match?

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,430
Get Coach Kazamatsuri out! 
Coach Kazamatsuri!

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,960
Just a moment, please. I shall read
Mr. Kazamatsuri's comments now.

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,350
"Yawara Inokuma's opponent, Yuki Tohdoh, 
is a very strong defender in her weight
class for the national matches...

37
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,840
..and is over 20 kilograms heavier than her, 
but in this case, that is pretty irrelevant.

38
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,580
I, Kazamatsuri, predict that 
Yawara Inokuma will win."

39
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,020
End of comment.

40
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,600
Wait a sec! What does he mean by "...in 
this case, that is pretty irrelevant"?

41
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,110
We need more than just that comment!

42
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,180
Yes, but...

43
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,420
We want him in person!

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,180
But, umm...

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,670
Get him out here!

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,550
Tokunaga-san, please forgive me.

47
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,220
Because of my nervous tendencies, 
I've caused you all this trouble.

48
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,650
But, Yawara-san, your incredible skills
will finally be made public.

49
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,650
Yuki Tohdoh... she's not even close 
to being your opponent!

50
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,890
Gimme a break!

51
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,450
So, Miss Yuki Tohdoh, you don't feel 
you'll lose in the coming match?

52
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,850
You expect to win?

53
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,780
Of course! Matter of fact, I didn't need
to accept to do this match.

54
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,800
But I accepted for the sake of the 
Japanese Judo World.

55
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,310
To "Yawara" or whatever her name was... I'll teach that girl the true terror of real judo!

56
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,640
Somebody, volunteer!

57
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,430
Me!

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,180
In that match, one minute...

59
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,870
No, 30 seconds, and I'll beat her!

60
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,840
But I doubt I'll even need
30 seconds, though!


61
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,290
And so, athlete Tohdoh is all fired up.

62
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,740
How is the mysterious Yawara Inokuma
going to fight against her?

63
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,210
The excitement is starting to build up!

64
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,030
What excitement is there to build up?

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,710
That stupid Daily Every reporter!

66
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,470
Yawara won't even need 10 seconds 
to whip that opponent!

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:20,350
So, even as the Judo Club coach, Mr. Kaizuka, you knew nothing about Yawara Inokuma?

68
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,570
Y... yes, principal.

69
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:29,020
And as the PE teacher, Mr. Kawakami,
you didn't notice any hidden athletic 
potential in her during class?

70
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,270
No potential. She's just a normal 
high school female.

71
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,640
I didn't sense any sort of advanced 
physical ability at all.

72
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,580
Then what is all the 
commotion about?

73
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,750
If it is true, though, then it would be 
highly honorable for our school.

74
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,730
Hey, Yawara, did you see 
your opponent on TV?

75
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,900
She was scary-looking, like a 
gorilla or something!

76
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,390
Why'd you agree to fight 
a person like that?

77
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,340
If not, then no one would 
believe that I'm weak.

78
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,380
Yeah, right... you seem to
look weak anyway!

79
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,150
The enemy's twice your size!

80
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,400
You're gonna get killed!

81
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,390
Listen, Yawara. If you're about
to get hurt, just cry!

82
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,580
If you cry, I'm sure she'll back off. Even she's got to have an ounce of sympathy in her!

83
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,430
Maybe I should fight for you!

84
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,650
Yeah, let Kaori do it!

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,050
Yeah! Let her, Yawara!


86
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,840
Inokuma.

87
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,460
Hanazono-kun.

88
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,920
Th... the time has finally come, hasn't it?

89
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,350
D... do your best.

90
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,070
What's up with that?

91
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,840
His head was steaming.

92
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,610
Wow!

93
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,990
Yes, this the Daily Every Sports editorial room.

94
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,460
Yawara Inokuma's profile? 
Just read our paper... ours!

95
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,450
The place is Saikai College's Judo Hall.

96
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,460
So, Coach Kazamatsuri predicted 
Yawara Inokuma's victory, eh?

97
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,490
Well, it's hard to determine the winner.

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,870
But, I can say this.


99
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:28,380
This match may reveal the genius girl 
who might shoulder the Japan... 
no, the world's Judo World.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,910
This is surely the biggest scoop that this
Daily Every has had in its entire history!

101
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,290
Matsuda-san. Matsuda-san.

102
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,180
Oh, there you are.

103
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,010
What are you doing here?

104
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,810
The editor-in-chief's overjoyed.

105
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,670
And the editorial department is chaotic with 
an overwhelming number of inquiries.

106
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,310
Yawara-chan's popularity is really enormous.

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,780
Oh, but she's gonna lose, right?

108
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,810
Ahh, shut up!

109
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,360
Oww...

110
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,030
What are you looking for?

111
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,720
Yawara Inokuma's...

112
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,230
Oh, Matsuda-san, you're still not 
giving up on her, are you?

113
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,370
Well, I can see why, since you were 
so obsessed with her.

114
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,290
You're trying to find a way to
not let her lose, right?

115
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,540
That's not it!

116
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,590
What I'm looking for is 
Yawara Inokuma's father!

117
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,510
Yawara-chan's father?

118
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,930
The man having Jigoro Inokuma as the father and having Yawara Inokuma as the daughter...

119
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,040
He's got to have left his name in 
the world of judo somewhere.

120
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,720
I see. It runs in the family... 
just like a thoroughbred.

121
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,460
Quit jabbering and help me find him!

122
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,050
C'mon, c'mon, is that it?

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,460
That's it, Yawara!

124
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,720
This is the first time you've been 
so fired up for practice!

125
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,760
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,310
But, that's not enough.

127
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,860
You'll need to improve more if you 
want to astonish the world!

128
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,750
Let's go!

129
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,630
This will be the last practice with Grandpa.

130
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,250
And, it's the last judo for me.

131
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,430
Good, that's the spirit!

132
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,010
I'm going to lose, you know!

133
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,110
Okay, lower your hips now!

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm sorry... really sorry, Grandpa!

135
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,250
Found him!

136
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,100
M... Matsuda-san.

137
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,030
1974 National Champion!

138
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,120
A rookie appeared like a comet!

139
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,510
This debut sounds just like the plan that Jigoro Inokuma set up for Yawara Inokuma!

140
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,920
Despite being nameless until the year
before, he appeared out of nowhere 
and stole away the championship.

141
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,950
But, the following year, he was 
nowhere to be found.

142
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,950
He ran away!

143
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,950
What?

144
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,370
One year after his debut, he succeeded in disappearing from the world of judo.

145
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,180
His name is?


146
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,120
His name is...

147
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,610
Kojiro Inokuma!

148
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,030
The match is finally tomorrow, huh?

149
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:36,980
Yes.

150
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,040
Do your best, okay? Oh yeah, no use,
since you're gonna lose, huh?

151
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,800
I'll do my best to lose.

152
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,500
I warn you, don't lose so easily. 
You'll give away the setup if you do.

153
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,000
Just act like you're trying hard. Make sure 
you attack every once in a while.

154
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,160
That way, people will think 
that's all you are.

155
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,190
Yes.

156
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,190
You seem really refreshed.

157
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,370
I do?

158
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,780
You're totally different from last time. 
You seemed like you were about 
to cry the whole time.

159
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,230
I seemed to have troubled you, but 
I'm bidding farewell to judo.

160
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,070
Thank you for everything.

161
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,160
Is your father... going to come?

162
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,130
Eh?

163
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,500
At tomorrow's match. Is Kojiro 
Inokuma going to come?

164
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,360
Why? Why do you know about my father?

165
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,610
Maybe you can see your father again!

166
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,080
My dad won't come back yet.

167
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,460
My mom is out looking for him, but I haven't heard any news about finding him yet.

168
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,480
Your mother is out looking for him?


169
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,330
She comes back home a few times 
out of the year, but otherwise, 
she's out searching for him.

170
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:17,120
Why did your father run away? One year 
after the national championships... why?

171
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,900
I don't know.

172
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,710
This is the last time I'll meet you like this.

173
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,900
To tell you the truth, I don't want you to lose.

174
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,020
I wanted you to win and win on, 
like in my dreams.

175
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,960
You really saw that much in me...?

176
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm sure there'll be another person 
much more stronger than me!

177
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,450
Y... yeah, I guess so. 
There'll be another, huh?

178
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,660
Well, I need to go now. We're going to 
be busy for tomorrow's preparation.

179
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,490
Yes. Thank you very much.

180
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,670
You're a senior in high school. After quitting judo, what are you going to do?

181
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,880
I want to go to an all-female college.


182
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:53,800
Grandpa wants me to go to a 
martial-arts related school, but I 
want to major in housekeeping.

183
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,610
Housekeeping, huh? Then you 
need to study hard.

184
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,600
Yes. Well then.

185
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,740
Later.

186
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,240
I've been hearing it. Ever since I saw you.

187
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,780
All that supportive cheering 
from the large crowds!

188
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:39,860
Yawara! Yawara!

189
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,000
Yawara! Yawara!
All right!

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,040
All right!

191
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,370
The cheers are getting smaller.

192
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,440
And tomorrow, everything will end.

193
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,030
Tomorrow...

194
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,220
Yuki Tohdoh, it's finally time!

195
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,810
How do you feel about today's match?

196
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,230
As I've said many times, today's 
thing isn't even a match!

197
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,200
30 seconds! I'll win in 30 seconds!

198
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,740
You are...

199
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,470
Jigoro Inokuma!

200
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,920
30 seconds is such a waste. 5 seconds, 5 seconds! 5 seconds is all that's needed.

201
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,760
Another kitsune-udon!

202
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,170
5 seconds and who'll win?

203
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,800
Another tanuki-udon!

204
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,610
Of course Yawara!





205
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,310
Another kitsune-udon!

206
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,210
You bold chump!

207
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,180
Then I'll win in 3 seconds!

208
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,760
Another tanuki-udon!

209
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,420
Then I'll go for one second!

210
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,290
And then, with one finger, 
she'll take you down!

211
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,460
Another kitsune-udon!

212
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,240
You old geezer!

213
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,800
Another tanuki-udon!

214
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,510
Not bad kitsune-udon for 
a college mess hall!

215
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,140
Hey, hey, there's so many 
people outside! I'm surprised!

216
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,090
Yawara really doesn't look
good in these, huh?

217
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,950
Yeah, really.

218
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:35,970
Right?

219
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,080
Besides, judo outfits have no
fashion quality whatsoever.

220
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,130
Yeah, no coloring.

221
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,390
It's too plain. Really plain.

222
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,290
You should put on a ribbon, at least.

223
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,210
Yeah, you need at least this one-point fashion.

224
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,120
Yup, that's a lot cuter, Yawara.

225
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:01,760
Dosuko--i! Dosuko--i! Dosuko--i!
(Dosuko--i! : An athletic grunt, more commonly used by huge sumo wrestlers)

226
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,480
Yawara.

227
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,410
If you're gonna run, now's the time.

228
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,850
It's too late to run.

229
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,660
Aren't you scared, Yawara?

230
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,720
Yeah, your opponent is the type that 
bounces off 10 people at once.

231
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,180
O... of course I'm scared. Scared 
enough to want to run away.

232
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,100
But, in order to calm down the 
commotion, I need to do it.

233
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,150
But you might get killed!

234
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,550
In the least, you'll probably break
a couple of bones!

235
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,550
You should run away, Yawara.

236
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,190
Uhmm...

237
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,560
Hey, look guys!

238
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,700
Kazamatsuri-san!

239
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,590
It's almost time, huh?

240
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,180
Yes.

241
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,190
Who is it? Who is it?

242
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,030
Don't tell me he's the one
you've been dating!

243
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,050
Introduce him to us, Yawara!

244
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,310
U... uhmmm...

245
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,430
I am Kazamatsuri.

246
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,590
Wonderful!

247
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,830
W... we're Yawara's friends!

248
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,570
And I'm single, by the way!

249
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,370
Me too.

250
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,650
And me, too.

251
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,810
N... nice to meet you all.

252
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,480
Yawara-san, I might be a bit pretentious, but there's more than a 20 kilogram difference between you and your opponent.

253
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,650
You're at a disadvantage if 
you're pinned down.

254
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:24,530
Please be more careful when the opponent 
tries to pull a throw to a pindown combo.

255
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,720
Y... yes.

256
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,980
T... that's okay. If she's in a 
pinch, she'll just cry.

257
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,690
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,810
If she cries, the match will end, right?

259
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,070
Well, it depends on the referee, but...

260
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,130
Yawara-san, anyways, you'll win for sure.

261
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,860
What a stud!

262
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,010
Wonderful!

263
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm tingling!

264
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,820
I'll look forward to your 
awesome display of skills.

265
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,920
Kazamatsuri-san.

266
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,850
U... uhh, we'll go on ahead.

267
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,820
Yawara, do your best with, whatever!

268
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,380
I know you still have your suspicions, but 
this isn't the time to explain things, is it?

269
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,040
But it's not that I suspect you for...

270
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,300
That's okay. Just think about the match now.

271
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,310
But...

272
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,210
Kazamatsuri-san, but in this match...

273
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,350
Everybody in the hall. Thank you
for your patience.

274
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,440
We will now begin the match between 
Yuki Tohdoh and Yawara Inokuma.

275
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,830
Well, shall we go?

276
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,620
Yes.

277
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,590
Well, well.

278
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,470
We see each other often, don't we?

279
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,880
Because you sniffed around like a hyena, Yawara-san is able to debut.

280
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,130
I appreciate that.

281
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,290
Yawara Inokuma!

282
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,820
You took my... my Kazamatsuri-san!

283
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,530
Inokuma!

284
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,470
Inokuma!


285
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,020
Yawara Inokuma is here!

286
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,700
Go on, Yawara-san.

287
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,600
Yawara, why don't you give a good 
face for the camera people?

288
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:29,530
Oh well, you could save your 
best smile for when you get the 
National Achievement Award, though!

289
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,970
Inokuma. Finally... it's finally time, huh?

290
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:53,100
No way she'll lose. She beated me, 
the nation's third best, you know.

291
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,080
It's not too late!

292
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,900
Just cry, Yawara!

293
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,340
You're gonna die!

294
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,700
Bow!

295
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,480
Begin!

296
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,980
Hurry up and win it, Yawara.

297
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,210
You don't need to work 
hard on this opponent.

298
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,960
Okay, do an ippon-zeoi there!
[ippon-zeoi : one-armed shoulder throw]

299
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,150
There you go!

300
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,090
Yuhkoh! 
[Yuhkoh : partial 5 points]

301
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,820
Inokuma!

302
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,710
