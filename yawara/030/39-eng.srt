1
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,385
Yaw-a ra! Yawam!

2
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:33,551


3
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,177


4
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:39,265
How dare you skilp pmctice! Where'd
you go, you lazy girl?

5
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,725
Vawarra!

6
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,768


7
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,894
Gem: morning, Grandpa.

8
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,603


9
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,771
It is not a good morning.

10
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:44,896


11
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,607
Stop eatmgi! We have morm-ng pracnce!

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,984
I a-tzready practiced.

13
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,652
What?

14
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,114
It's unusual for you to oversleep, Farther.

15
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,157
It's adready S o'clock?

16
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,368
Why didn't you wake me up, Varwara?

17
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,454
Don't tell me you only dim a light wurkout.

18
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,622
Ridiculous !

19
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:09,587
Oh? What happened last night probably
tired you out, so I thought you
needed a break this morning.

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,300
Sh... Shut up!

21
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:19,389
I was asking your senior students to "please
take care of my granddaughter."

22
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,058
And what were you domg out the-t Late anyway?

23
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:29,274
rm in college already, so I'm busy with
new friends and places to go.

24
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:29,357


25
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,401
New friends, huh?

26
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:31,484


27
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:36,031
I bet you were secretly dating
some perverted guy.

28
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:36,865
That's so mean!

29
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:37,866
I must be right.

30
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,326
Everyone, please. Not this eariy in the morning,

31
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,370
This sucks. I'm going.

32
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,163


33
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:48,084
Yawara! You'd better not be
one second late for curferm

34
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:57,177
Last night, I was invited by those
so-calied cheerleaders. .,

35
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,804
Grandpa, you're fu.n',

36
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,185
Oops, that was karate... oh well.

37
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,355
What corruption.

38
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:14,027
Even I fell prey to that merry atmosphere,
so Vawara has no chance

39
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,656
What a horrifying Mii-haa coilege! Its too evil!

40
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:35,715


41
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,926
After fourth period, let's go to Roppongi.

42
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,761
What did you cheese as your miner?

43
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,431
IInaokwma-san.

44
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,183
Ah, Fujiloo-sam

45
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,393
Thank you for yesterday.

46
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:52,524
So, fiill out this course registration form.

47
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,860
Okay, Home Emnnomics courses
and major-related commas

48
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,154
Clothing guidelines and Nutrition courses.

49
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,533
This is so specialized. This
is what college Level is like.

50
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:06,913
But we have general education courses
along with these major coursesw
Zlyeaar colleges are pretty hectic.

51
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,205


52
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,832
We might not have- time to have fun

53
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,251
No. Don't give up, lnukuma-san-

54
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,964
Let's find a wonderful man and enjoy
our youth as math as we can!

55
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,633
To do that, we need to find the right club.

56
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:19,926


57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,930
momma-sen, were you in
any clubs in high school?

58
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,473
No. not reaI'Iy.

59
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,728
You said you did tea or flower ceremonies.

60
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,187
Do you have a license yet?

61
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,231
I guess first degree.

62
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,107
First degree?

63
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,692
Wow, that's great.

64
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,277
It s nuthung much.

65
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:37,360


66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,737
What about you, Fujilm-san?

67
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,948
I don't have anything.

68
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,912
Anyway, let's find a good
cllub today, Inozkuma-sa'n.

69
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,039
Okay.



70
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,252
Which should we join?

71
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:59,049
Unlike yesterday's gloomy I-CZLulb,
we should find a livelier clulb.

72
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,091
Yes, I agree.

73
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,179
Hey, two new chub members!

74
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,306
Wh... who are you guys?

75
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:12,270
I am Mi'tsuxba College's Ochi-Club member,
Edogawa's "What's up" Kama.

76
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,939
I am Hayashiya Kompei-tou

77
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,231


78
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,274
Ochi-Club?

79
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,610
As in Comic storytelling research club?

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,904
Absolutely! Life is a big joke!

81
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:25,325
Enjoy yowr fashionable coilege life fashionably
in the OCIhIFCIlUb! Just kidding.

82
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,452
Registranan is over nere.

83
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,162
Wait a minute.

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,330
I... lnokuma-san.

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:30,497


86
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,956
Lat me go!

87
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,793
Don't be so cold. Phase. Please.

88
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,672


89
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:44,010
I told you abreaady, I don't have time
to waste an you pathetic iools.

90
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,389


91
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,933
W.,. we get the hint!

92
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,818
So, youu guys wre looking for
a club to find good men, too?

93
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,153
Sounds weird when you say it so bluntly.

94
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:08,368
But. I thought the fastest way to enjoy
my youth was to meet a nice man.

95
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:13,081
Don't be so naive to milk about youth.

96
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,415


97
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,290
Oh really?

98
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,666


99
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:24,551
With a mind set like that. you'll! get fooled
by a guy and dumped in a second.

100
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:32,100
Relationship are not a boy-girl game or romance.
It's a wm or loae high-tension battle.

101
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:39,774
A wumavn's liilfe objective is to find the best
man. Once you find a good man, don't ever
let him go. Then marry into the wealth!

102
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,823
If you're looking for a good guy,
leave it to me. Follow me.

103
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
Please teach us!

104
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,041
Everyone, please join the Archery Chub!

105
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,210
Ixnokuma-san, aren't thQ Archery
Club's uniforms wonderful?

106
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,419


107
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,045
Yes, they are.

108
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:00,337


109
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,674
That club's not good. They practice so hard,
they don't hawe time to hang out with guys.

110
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,262
And their cn-ed parties have bullky idiotic jocks.

111
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:09,721


112
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,680


113
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:15,310
That Sociology Club is a good place.

114
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,560


115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,604
It seems so saph-isticated.

116
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:17,687


117
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,150
But their co-ed mates are from
the elite Toudau Universr'ty.

118
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,991
So, if you catch a Toudou University
elite now, your potential to mmry
a first class businessman is high.

119
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,826
You've thmught that far?

120
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,830
Isn't that different from the image
of a college girl's youth?

121
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,122
Isn't that different from the image
of a cml'lege girl'x youth?

122
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,331


123
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,709
Yeah. that's why I was thinking of this club.

124
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,711


125
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,629
Golf club?

126
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,962


127
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,632
Isn't that an old man's game?

128
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,007


129
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,720
Whax are you saying? This is the trendiest
wort for young people rigm now.

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:50,804


131
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,930
Just fallow me.

132
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,640


133
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,895
Excuse me, but I huealrd that your co-ed mates
are from Meilhou University, is that true?

134
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,104


135
00:07:59,104 --> 00:07:59,896
Yes, they are.

136
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,021
Yes, they are.

137
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:06,695
You've heard about Msihou University, full
of rich boys with great career: set up.

138
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:06,820


139
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,156
They're- the hottest group among
the college girls these days.

140
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,407


141
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,618
But, we've never played golf before.

142
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:13,827


143
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,245
It's okay.

144
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,124
The Meiihnou University men
will teach you hands-on,

145
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,209
See? It gets even better!

146
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:21,376


147
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,629
W'eTe going to join, so please
help us out, semnpaa.

148
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,840
Umm, but we...

149
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,843
I decidedk l 'm joining.

150
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,722
That's good. You're ta-ll, so you
might be able to hm far.

151
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,851
Mensa dnnt talk about my height!

152
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,855
Let's join this club, Inakuma-aan.

153
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,149
But, I have a curfew.

154
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,817
Curfew? What time?

155
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:46,609
b o'clock.

156
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,112
No way! That's like a grade school curfew!

157
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,990
You won't ever find a guy with that restriction!

158
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:59,748
Unlike other clubs. our practice ends early,
so it won't interfere with your curfew.

159
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,081


160
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,875
It's okay, right, lnokuma-san?

161
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,294
Three new members!

162
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,756
Oh, ft's a little late, but I'm Komriya YukarL

163
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,507
Itou Fujiko.

164
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,551
I-nokunma Vawara.

165
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,178
Nice to meet yam

166
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:27,525


167
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,279
See, just lika this. ht's not that hard, IS it?

168
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,655


169
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,617
I see. Golf isn't so hard.

170
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:35,867


171
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,869
Aren't you grippung int backwards!

172
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:38,328


173
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:38,912
Really?

174
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,996


175
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,164
Luke this?

176
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,791
Yes, it Inoaks good.

177
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,124


178
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,502
No, the grip is too shallow.

179
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,172
You'll slice all your balls, Yaw-ara-san.

180
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,508
Kazamautsulri-san.

181
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,093


182
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,554
Golf is a good, relaxing sport.

183
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:05,230
Filrst, relax and approach the ball. Then, be
square with the ball and swing through from
the inside tn the outside. That's the basics.

184
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,815
Y... Yes.

185
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,400


186
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,151
Let me try for a bit.

187
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:28,503
Yawara-san, I"m sorry I was too busy
to come to your ceremanry.

188
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,548

00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:51,192

lnakuma-sann, is he your boyfriend?

200
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,078
That's not fair.

201
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,873
How could you hide such a wonderful boyfriend?

202
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:05,915
No, hoe's norm

203
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,835
Oh, he's Inokuammsan's acquaintance.

204
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,169


205
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:19,137

Me-ihou miles, so a wonderful person like

206
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:19,220

00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:24,684

But I came to celebrate Yawara-san's
college induction.

00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,217


224
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:44,556
The ship my father bought me can't

225
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,018

00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,940


229
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:03,658
It's very unfortunate that I cannot introduce
my fiance: Kazamatsuri-san, to
everyone. He's still at work.

230
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,954
Oh yes, you a-Lready have a wonderful fianm

Yes. And he's also very handsome!

234
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,964


235
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,092
That's great. I would like to meet him.

236
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:30,393
Kazamatsuri-san! Where could you
be, ditching this party? Gosh.

237
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:36,024


238
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:40,737

The atmosphere is so different
from yesterday's I--CI u, b party

00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,214
This is it, lnokuma-san! This is the

242
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,427
We need to get going and try

But, our semor girls are so maltuwre
and wear such nice ciothesh

245
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,475
But, OUII' senior girls are so mature
and wear such nice clothes.

246
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,727
Don't say that.

247
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,189
Seniuriity has nothing to do with cantchung men.

248
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,857
You"ll lase out if you're shy.

249
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,612

262
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:15,373


263
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,959

264
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,293


265
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,712
I-t's your faullt for standing there.

266
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,172
You did it on purpose.

267
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:22,297


268
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,549

00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,971
I didn't come to talk about this!

272
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:35,977
Jigoro-san, you know about the Judo
Warm Cup in Seoul, Korea.

276
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,120
I look forward to fighting lnakuma Yawara.

277
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,123
Yawara, we'll fight for rec-ml next time.

278
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,127
All of them keep mentioning Yawa-ra-san..

279
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:06,216
They entered this tournament for her.

280
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,634
For YawaraI-san.

281
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,512
Yes, yes.

282
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:16,434

284
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,438
What's wrong? You don't seem too happy.

285
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,272


286
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,482
Not really.

287
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,024


288
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,695
You're new. What's your name?
Have you played golf before?

289
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,489


290
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:34,661
i'm ltou Fuji.ko, from Sh-izuoka Prefecture.
I've never played golf before.

291
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:39,708
Is that so? Why don't we tallk over some drinks?

292
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,042
I don't drink much

293
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:41,209


294
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,086
Just one drink.

295
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,548
I"ll have some.

296
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,926

Some mare, pleaae.

298
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:51,469

00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,192
Don't werdo it. See you later.

301
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,277


302
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,279
So you're a heavy drinker, Fujikotsanu

303
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:09,529


304
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,866
I dnnt know because I've never drank before.

305
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,953
Are you able to handbe so much for the WSI time?

306
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,620


307
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,875
Well, I'm starting to feel waird.
The roamn's spinning.

308
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,836
Fujiko-san. your face is changing colors.

309
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,295


310
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:29,674
Oh, my head is banging. I feel sick.

311
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,384


312
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,344
Fujfko-san!

313
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,057
Fm swaying. . .

314
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,352
Yawara-san. Uh, excuse me.

315
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:40,518


316
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,771
Oh, Kazamatmriwsan, where are ycm going?

317
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,815
Wenlll, I'm here for Yawa'ra-san's celebration.

318
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:45,899


319
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,276
No, weTe not betting you go tonight.

320
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,237
Oh. the bathroom. I need to
go to the bathroom. Ok?

321
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:51,446


322
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,239
Oh. how boring.

323
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:53,323


324
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,616
Came back soon.

325
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:06,419
The Warld Cup representative for Japan ign't
diischosed yet, but it's probably Yawara-san
because she won the Japan Nationals.

326
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,592
That's good. It's about time to show
Yawara to the worid anyway.

327
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:17,931
But knowing Yawara-san, I wonder
if she'll do the taurnament.

328
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:24,229
Anyway. I'll mks her do the tournament
whether she wants to or not,

329
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:29,526
But it's way past practice time and
Yawara-chan isn't here yet

330
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,736
Will she be okay?

331
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,988
O... of course.

332
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,368
That air headed girl. Where could she be?

333
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,285


334
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,578
Are you okay. Fujikso-saan?

335
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:40,704


336
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:44,833
Oih, fur mow. I should be okay.

337
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,254
Aren't you late for your curfew,
Inakuma-san? Is it okay?

338
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,463
Yes.

339
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,381


340
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,050
You cur'ew-hreakrng, delinquent gn'rl!

341
00:18:54,801 --> 00:19:00,223
I'm a college student already, so I'm not going
to let Grandpa push me around anymore.

342
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,227
Thank you. rm fine.

343
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,521
Let's go back, Izmkuma-san.

344
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:10,817
We're going to start enjoying our youth now!

345
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,534
Kazamatsulrim san.

346
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:24,247
Yawara-saun, we're finally alone.

347
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,465
I'm bored. Without Kazamatsuri-san,
this party is boring.

348
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,966
Yes, Miss.

349
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,386
I don't want to stick around this
stupid gatharhng anymore.

350
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,888
Yes, Miss.

351
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,140
Maybe I should end it soon.

352
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,516
Oh, but...

353
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,059


354
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,896
Hey, Miss Sayanka might end this party soon!

355
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,858
No way! I haven't talked to a single girl yet!

356
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,363
We need to entertain her. What
if we talked to her about judo?

357
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:56,446


358
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,490
Yeah, that's a good idea.

359
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,116
What are you talking about?

360
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,955
W... welll, we were commenting on
how beautiful and strong you were.

361
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:06,039


362
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,457
Yes! Exactly!

363
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,837
Beautiful and strong! Perfect words
for a queen like myself.

364
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,380


365
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,007
The-t match at the Martial Arts Hall was great.

366
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:19,511
Yes, I watched it also. The Osh-i:u:ri TV Cup.

367
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:19,928


368
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:24,391
Oh yeah, what was that gixrrs
name? Sayak'msads rival?

369
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:24,683


370
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,393
Oh, lnokuma Vawaara.

371
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,939
Yeah, I know. She's pretty cute.

372
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,650
She's cute, but really strong, too.

373
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:33,858


374
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:38,905
In the finals, she won in just two seconds.
Her ilppon-zecn' was awesome.

375
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:39,322


376
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:42,951
She total'ly flipped Sayakasan!

377
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,593
How unsettiing! Damn Inokuma Yawara!

378
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:10,937
A country girl like her won by pure luck. Those
fools can't even understand a queen that's
beautiful. arong, nch, and powerful like myself.

379
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,991
T... T... To... To... Tokunaga:

380
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,283


381
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:23,908
Y
yes!

382
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,245
Tokunaga, land over there right now!

383
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,414
B... but, Miss.

384
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,248
Now!

385
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:30,331
Now!
Y..  yes, M-iss'

386
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:30,957
Y... yes, Miss!

387
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,588
So, you have time to join the golf club, I suppose.

388
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:50,060
Oh no. I'm not that interested in golf,
but I wanted to make new friends
and do thvings other than judo.

389
00:21:51,519 --> 00:22:02,989
I"m busy and stressed with work, but I find
it relaxing to be able to count the number
of stars alone with you, Yawara-sanV

390
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,784
Kazamatsuwri-san.

391
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,629
Sa'yaaka -san!

392
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:22,217
Unforgivable! You're unforgivable,
you cat-thief, Inokuvma Yawara!

393
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,930
How dare you... how dare you... how
dare you take my Kazavmavtauri'san!

394
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,933
Watch out, Yawaravsan!

395
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,351
I'm not letting you go!

396
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:31,768


397
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,437
Miss, please ca-lm down!

398
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,022
Let me go, Tokunaga!

399
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,280
Listen up, Inokuma Yawara!

400
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,659
I will not let you munch Kazamatsuri-san!

401
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,286
Kazamatsun -san , you EDD!

402
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,373
How could you do this to me!

403
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:53,581


404
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,291
Miss, please calm down!

405
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:55,542


406
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,961
What's that, Kazamatsuri-san? Do ycu know her?

407
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,796
No, I don't know her.

408
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:00,130


409
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,047
Right, Yawara-san?

410
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:01,339


411
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:01,840
Yes.

412
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,477
Inokuma Yawara.

413
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:29,325
Yawaara, not only did you skip piractice,
but you also drank again!

414
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:34,789
The golf club members seemed like college
students really enjoying college
life. How wonderfwl.

415
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,998


416
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:40,045
You're ten... no, a hundred years too young
to even try a sport other than judo.

417
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,715
But Fujiko-san is so dedkated.
I need to try a htthe harder.

418
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,383
Yawara! Are you listening, Yawara?

419
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,345
Next, an Yawara! "Fujikmsan's Secret!"

420
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:48,553


421
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,139
l"ll do a suwkuI-nage an you if you don't watch!
