Dun? tell me that you're going to wear
that hip-wrap to attract men!

42
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:34,863


43
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,199
Don't say hip-wrap. It's a mini skirt.

44
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,827


45
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,789
I'm going to be a college student, so
I want to wear good clothes, too.

46
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,877
You're a hundred years too early to attract men.

47
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:54,799
Besides, your deceased grandmother,
Kavneko, never were those, but she
was beautiful enough anyways.

48
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,633


49
00:02:55,633 --> 00:03:01,806
Of course not! They didn't
have mini skirts back then.

50
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,098


51
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,893
Really, Kaneko was very beautiful back then.

52
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,143


53
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,606
She was so beautiful that she was
shining gloriously like Buddha.

54
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:19,449
Kaneko and l were dlrawn to each other by
the red string of fate during the rough times
revolving around the ZNZG incident!

55
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,409
Grandpa, not that story again!

56
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,870

188
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,290


189
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,084

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,674
No. Jmormsan, my uncle isn't a j'udao mater.

192
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,802
He's Saushin'ryu's tea ceremony master.

193
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,386


194
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,095

A tea master?

197
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,597
A tea master?

198
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,151

199
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,986


200
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,573
Good for you to notice.- Iit's a Raku-yaki Chojiro.

201
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,074


202
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,951
It's one of the finest ceramic pieces.

203
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,660


204
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,330
I want you to drink this tea from this cup.

205

00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,083


208
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,461
No, Kanekn. You have a talent
for tea ceremonies.

209
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,631
Will you be my successor?

210
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,095
I came to visit for this reason.

211
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:37,554


212
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:43,268
Don't waste your time trying to maintain
this judo dojo endlessly by yourself.

213
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:43,643


214
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,144

218
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,068


219
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,777

222
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,336
Tea ceremony, geez.

223
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:13,214
You can't get a cha-bashizra when you
make tea like that anyway. Bori-ng.

224
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,466
W... we l.I.  .

Oh. Sorry, sorry.

241
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,076
Nothing has gone right fox me since
I came here from Aomon, so...

242
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,912
...l'm not sure things will go as planned.

243
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,373
Wh... what are you saying?

244
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,208

00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:30,500

The tatami mats are vital to the dojo!

274
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,793
The tatami mats are more Important!

275
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,253

00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,380

You need a break every now and then.

295
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:43,633
Thuis, this! Lefs hit the Grinza cafes.
There's a lot of pretty girls there.

"Oh, but the train slipped away
and Kaneko was left behind."

456
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,228
"The hands of fate have graciously
teased the two of them!"

457
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:52,729


458

But, dun! worry Kanekn ran fast. She
was running and running until she caught
up to the train in the next station.

460
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:06,117
And, at that station, they vowed their true Love...

00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:07,619


464
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,953
What am I lying about?

465
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:09,579


466
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,582
Grandma coulth have rwn so fast.

467
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:12,874
Grandma couldn't have run so fast.

468
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,084


469
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,211
Trains back then didn't go that fast,

470
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,128


471
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,214

00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:20,840


474
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,384
Yeah, that man."

475
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:22,926


476
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:30,517
....Sato Daimku. eventually became the primne
minister, and was the key man for modernizing
Japan through public pollEnies in that era.

477
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,976


478
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:36,272
He was able to do that only becaxuss I
straightened him out: in his early years.

479
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:36,356


480
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:41,820
And so, the modem Japan exists,
pUIrely because of me!

481
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,612


482
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,114
That's so messed up!

483
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,492
What happened to the reporters?

484
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,745
They left a long time ago.

485
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:51,162


486
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,956
Those idiots!

487
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:53,164


488
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:57,127
If they would just listenn and use my story. then
the sales of their papers would surely skyrocket!

489
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:57,585


490
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,504
Why wc'uld they do that?

491
00:22:59,504 --> 00:22:59,713


492
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,508
It's hard to tell how true yuuir
stories are, Grandpa.

493
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,306
H. has a bit of truth to it.

497
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,747

to wear for these things!

498
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:37,250
If you dont came to practice soon, I might not
let you go to than: Mii-haa College, after a:lll!

499
