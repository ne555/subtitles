1
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,643
Father, Yawara will be back soon.

2
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,436
Let's rust eat dixnnrmr.

3
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,606
She's late! Late! Very late!

4
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,444
She called to say that she's going to be late
because of a dinner celebration with friends.

5
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,321
A dinner celebration?

6
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:53,905


7
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,700
Tamas-sen. I wfll not alilow it!

8
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,744
I won't let her go to the Mii -haa Cnl'lege!

9
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,621
Nil go check outside again!

10
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:01,746


11
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,872
Father!

12
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,168
It's going to be hard to make him understand.

13
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,597
I feel so dizzy.

14
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,602
The alcohol is Finally getting
to me, since I did that.

15
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,195
Why did I do that?

16
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,948
You must fight Jody!

17
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,492
I want to write a great article about it!

18
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,536
It's avlll Matsuda-sawn's fawlit.

19
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,247
He's just unng me for news material.

20
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:44,456


21
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,791
That's right, its all his fault.

22
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,627
But. throwing him was the worst thing to do.

23
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,338
My head feels so light.

24
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,303
Grand pa .

25
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,476
Y... you... drank alcohol, didn't you!

26
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,519
J... just a turtle bit of wine, that's all.

27
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:11,941
Your face is like a red snake-gourd, so don't re"
me you just drank a lirttle, you delinquent child!

28
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,778
This is what I thought would happen!

29
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,864
You're already like this, celebrating your
qualification to that Miihaa College!

30
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,073


31
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:22,285
When you start going there, you'll slack
off even more and go straight to hell!

32
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:22,494


33
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,787
Welmmue home, Vawara..

34
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,704
Mom.

35
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,414
Congratulations. Good for you.

36
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,249
It's not good at all

37
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,211
I know what will happen now.

38
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,924
Fiurst, she'll join the ranks of the flaky
girls at Mii-haa Women's College.

39
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,093
An unruly bunch!

40
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:44,766
She'll wear hsavier makeup, racy clothes, and
hang out at that hot-bed of evill, DISCO clubs.

41
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,976
A not-bed of evill...?

42
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,061
...disco clubs?

43
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:48,937
Absolutely !

44
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,065
Then, a street gangster will
snare her at the disco.

45
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,609
And the rest is all downhilL

46
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,613
To pay the gangster, she'll sacrifice her
youthful body at a lowly escart service.

47
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,365
What a messed up scary.

48
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,284
Father. that's too extreme.

49
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:03,535


50
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:09,666
Nope, it's not extreme. I saw a pile
of those videos at Zen-san's electronics
shop depicting such scenarios.

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,377
Th... those videos... as in...!

52
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:17,340
Oh gosh, F alther, you stilll have an interest
in those, even at your age?

53
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:23,013
W... well, you know, I thought it would be rude
to refuse recommendahons from Zen-san.

54
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,765
A... anyway, I will not allow it!

55
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:31,312
You will go to Salkai College to practice intensely
am: man a youthful life of only judo'

56
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,232
What's with that face?

57
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,527
I tried so hard to get into Mvitsuba
College, but Grandpa, you ..

58
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,071
You don't need to try so hard for sevlufish things.

59
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,282
You're the selfish one!

60
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,620
W... wen now. Father, we should just eat dinner.

61
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,082
Yawara, go change. We'll talk about this later,

62
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,250
Ta.. Tamara-awn!

63
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,253
Leave the rest to me. Okay?

64
00:04:55,253 --> 00:05:00,050
Wait, Yawayra! Ilm not through with you! Yawaraj

65
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,888
Okay then.

66
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,639


67
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,976
Wen, Father, have a drink in celebration.

68
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,226


69
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,978
I won't drink it.

70
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
Well, just one.

71
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,361
Tau. Tamao-sam!

72
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,321
This is the famous sake, Hell on Wheels!

73
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,031
Oh  is that so?

74
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:29,204
This sake was supposed to be saved until
Yawara won the gold medal and received
the National Achievement Award!

75
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:29,496
This sake was supposes: to be saved un-til
Yawara wan the gold medal End received
the National Achievement Award!

76
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,288


77
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,208
Oh, it's fine. We can get avngther bottle then.

78
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:33,291


79
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,126
Please, eat dinner,

80
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,544


81
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,005
I don't feel like celebrating, but a
whale sea Dream fish feast, huh?

82
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,595
Weil, despite everything that's so
frustrating... this is dehcious!

83
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,808
The stewed vegetables are delicious, tool

84
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,559
Fat her .

85
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,105
Won't you allow Yaw-am to go Mitsuba
Women's Z-Year Col.lege..

00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,693
Tamao-san, this fried tatsu-ta is delicious!

87
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,742
Even if she goes to Mivtsuba Calllege.
she won't quit judcv.

88
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,372
Over the years, she's never
missed practices, has she?

89
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,545
If she was the kind of girl to quit jxudn
when she got into Mitsuba College,

90
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,797
then she would have qwit a long tvme ago.

91
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,843
She can't give up judo.

92
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,432
I've seen all three genarations of the
Inokumas, so I can't be wrong.

93
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:34,853


94

All three generations of Inukumas
are so stubborn!

99
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,045
Even if Mom tried, Grandpa is just too stubborn

100
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,338


101
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,884
Is getting the Olympic gold meda! so important?

102
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,555

Training intensely at Saikai College
and then going to the OIympics.

00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:53,658

00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,370

142
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:57,620


143
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,329

Nobody's asking you!

150
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,095

00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:28,860


154
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,030
Have you no respect for an

00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,944
Well, we can start from there.

167
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,113


168
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:18,743
This Chinese food ram-inns me... when
I went! on Manchuria dwring the war.

169
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,828


170
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,833
when I saw the oncoming hoard of Chdngse
cahrau'y, I picked them up and threw them. .

171
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,667


172
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,876
...and picked and threw them!

173
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,505
I completely defeated them!

174
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,840

Cool, cool, semen You're the best!

176
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,390
But, my fight didn't end there.

177
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:45,937
Before I cauld catch my breath, Russian tanks
fmm beyond the horiznns started to roll in.

178
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,897


179
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:53,653
I ram fearlessly tawards the ground-rumbH-ng
tanks. and with a mighty swmg,"

180
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:59,993
"flipped the tan-Ks, one by one! Even
the tanks were no match for me!

181
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:05,999
The sunset was exquisitely beautifwl
when it settled down on the Manchurian
horizon, after the battle

182
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,332
The sunset was exquisitely beautifuul
when it settled down an the Manchurian
horizon, after the battle.

183
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,959


184
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,672
I wish I could have witnessed your
marvels with my own eyes!

185
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:22,015
Oh. by the way. we wanted to discuss if
Yewarrsavn could go to that calllege...

186
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,183


187
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:23,683
Huh. . .

188
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,019
Thanks for the meal. Well, excuse me

189
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,854
J... Jigoro-sensei!

190
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,523
Hey, we're not finishad yet!

191
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,109
Ah, I'll tell you more storigs at another time.

192
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:37,113
I'l-l tel-l you about the time I captured am aircraft
carrier whirls floating in the unexplored oceans.

193
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,454
Jigoro-senseil Please!

194
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,416
Please let Yawara-san go to Mitsuba
Women's Z-Year College!

195
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,335
Out of the way. Hanazono-k'un.

196
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:55,590
No, I won't... until you allow
Yawara-aan to ga there!

197
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,426
I don't mke advice from strangers
about Vaw-ara's affairs.

198
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,346
Hey! You hard-headed piece-of-shit Gramps!

199
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,517
Yawara-cnan tried so hatd and finally
made llt imo Mitsuba College!

200
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,521
Why can't you recognize her effourts!
Don't you have any sympavmy'H

201
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:14,192
S... Sudoh, how can you say such
a thing to Jigoro-sensei?

202
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,947
I don't care if you're some judo
master! rll just make you...

203
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,824
I don't care if you're some judo
master! l 'll just make you...

204
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,121
How brave of you to challenge me!

205
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:26,371


206
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,415
Very well, I accept your challenge.

207
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,459
If you find me defenseless at any time, go
ahead and try to win an ippon from me

208
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,877
ippon?

209
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,795
That's right.

210
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:39,968
Since you're both judo athletes, uze Judo to
defeat me and convince me to change my mind.

211
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,806
So, if WP throw you once, then Yawara-chan
can go to Mitsuha College?

212
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,768
Okay! I'll do it, for Vawara-chan!

213
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,895
If you think you can do it. then try mel

214
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,408
Gramps, I gm you now!

215
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,372
Jiigurowensei, be pmpared'!

216
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:12,959
Too easy!

217
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,434
Excuse me!

218
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,815
It's hot!

219
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,615
Mahm, how is it?

220
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,535
Umm, well... hey, everyone, how does it look?

221
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,079
Hey, it's great!

222
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,497
Ix lonks good on you!

223
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,249
Really?


224
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,837
You shnuld get it! It's cool!

225
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,382
Wear it tn Mitsuba's welcoming ceremony!

226
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,551
But, it's a bit expensive.

227
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,261
D... don't worry.

228
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,266
It's our present to you, since you
quatified for MintS'uba College.

229
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,896
But, I kinda fee! bad. Well, I Like it a lot, though.

230
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,730
This wan't work.


231
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:21,653
I heard that this is the best shop for this
brandwname clothing, but this just won't work.

232
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,367
Miss, how vs II... awhx'n!

233
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,124
Oh, what a coincidence!

234
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,585
It's so nice to come to a commoner's
shop every once in a while-E

235
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,673
That clnthing looks great on you, Vawara-san.

236
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,425
S... Sayaka-san, you mm

237
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,510
Oh, not for me.

238
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:50,265
As you can see, my face is rather glamorous,
so this plain outfit seems so out of place.

239
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:50,348


240
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,185
I'm sn envious of you, Yawanra-san, since
any type of clothing matches ynuar face.

241
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,440
It's hard to teu if she's complimenting
her or degrading her

242
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,150
She's just showing off.

243
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:05,947
Are you perhaps going to wear that outfit to
the Satkaj College welcoming ceremouny?

244
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:12,537
You're so lucky to gm into the college with the
nation's best coaching staff and equipment.

245
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,080
No, I'm...

246
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:19,919
But, just because you get into Sanikai College
doesn't mean that you'll be able to beat me

247
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:24,341
Actually, I had the Seishiin Jyo-Gaukukan
Colhege create a judo club.

248
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,426
Once the construction of the new
judo arena is completed,

249
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:31,806
it'll be the must modern. state-of-the-art facility
in the nation, better than Sa-ilka: College.

250
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:42,150
Even the cuaching staff is top-notdw! I had
Kazamatsuri-saan be deployed from Hon'ami
Group to be the team's main coach.

251
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:48,448
I look forward to the fight against your Saikaui
Colhege team and my Semishjn Jyo-Gakulkan team!

252
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:48,573


253
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,409
It will be a match the warld would focus on!

254
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:58,958
Sayaka-san. I'm going to Mitsuba Z-Year
Women's College, not Saikai Calilege.

255
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,962
Mitsube Z-Year Women's College?

256
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,172
Veg.

257
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,301
That college doesn't even have
a judo team, does it?

258
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:08,843
Yea.

259
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,472
You won't get any stronger
by going there, will you?

260
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,056
Yes.

261
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,812
You're going to run away again, aren't
you? You win-and-run girH

262
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,564
Wh... what do you mean by "win-and-run girl"?

263
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,694
Because you luckily defeated me in Last
yaar's Martial Arts Hall Tournament,

264
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,654
You're going to keep that win and run
fmm other tournaments, aren't you?

265
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,572
N... no, than not what I meant to...

266
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:34,494
Listen. I can easiry beat you
right here. right now.

267
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,163
Are you so afraid to lose to me?

268
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:47,924
Fm going to enter the All-Japan Tournament,
so let's settle it then, Yawara-san.

269
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,510
AJ l-Japan Tournament?

270
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:57,767
I'm doing judo just to defeat you. You
have an obligation to fight me.

271
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,728
Tokunaga, I'm going home.

272
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,982
M... Miss! The price tags are still on!

273
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:15,410
Geez, Grandpa wants me to go to Saikai
College, and Sayaka-san wants me
to do the Ail-Japan Tournament.

274
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,912
Judo, huh?

275
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,668
Grandpa. And Hanazono-kun and Sudoh-kun..

276
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,922
Intricate plans won't work for the wnsezi.

277
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,550
We'll just have to attack him headmn.


278
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,803
Stfl-l trymg? Such persistent boys.

279
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:43,938


280
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,982
Hanaznno-kuwn, Sundnh-kun. Are you okay?

281
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,859
Y awawa- Chan.

282
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,444
lnokuma. sorry.

283
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,866
We tried to convince Jigoro-sense-i to al-low
you to go to Mitsuha College, but."

284
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,993
Grandpa. youha so mean!

285
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:00,997
l have no mercy against those who block
your way of getting into Saiwkan College:

286
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,002
Grandpa, no matter what you say.
I'm going to Mitsuba College.

287
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,838
What's this racy clothing?

288
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,423
Give it back!

289
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,552
You're gonna wear this to go to the hot-bed
of evil, dasco clubs, arent you?

290
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,221
There you go agam.

291
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,766
How could you!

292
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,519
Kaoru and the others bought
this for me as a present, too!

293
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,940


294
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,691
How could you!

295
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:27,899


296
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,943
I hate you, Grandpa!

297
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,246
Thanks for the meal.

298
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,424
Father, have you changed your mind vet?

299
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:59,347


300
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,308
This has the money I saved for Yawara.

301
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:02,475


302
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,561
Use this money to let her go to Mitsuba College.

303
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,194
She's still fantasizim about the outside worLd.

304
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:20,827
when she finally realizes that jludo is the best
thing in her life, won't that be the turn-ilng
point of her becoming a real judo athlete?

305
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:21,202
When she finally realizes that judo is the best
thing in her life, won't that be the turning
point of her becoming a real judo athlete?

306
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:27,334
She'll be okay, since she became so strong
withaut ever going to an offimal judo team.

307
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,795
It's an because of Father's excelhenut guidance!

308
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,425
You made Yawara Japan's
best jUdD athlete, Father!

309
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:42,557
But it's so unlike you. Father, to pais Yawara
on to strangers far traim'nsg now!

310
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,610
Tamamsan.

311
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,944
Yes?

312
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,864
I'm taking a berth. Please prepare-
some fresh clothes for me,

313
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:04,788


314
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,599
You made Yawara Japan's
best j-undo anthulne-te, Father!

315
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,518
Well, that's true.

316
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,239
Hurry up and do ZOO ukemi!

317
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:39,406
Hurry up and do ZOO ukemi!

318
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,956
Okay, how can I convince Father mday?

319
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,256
Dear Tamao-san. You don't
need to be troubled by this

320
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:05,140
You can use this money for Yawara's wedding
plans, after she gets the Olympic godd medal
and the National Achievement Award.

321
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,640


322
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,061
I can pay for her Mfi-haa Women's Col'lgge
with Just my pocket money.

323
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:10,687


324
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,730
F Ether.

325
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:11,938
Father.

326
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,441
Really?

327
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,943
Enough already. A judo athlete
stands by his words.

328
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,987
I"l.l a-Haw you to go to Miiuhaa Women's College.

329
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,658
But, in return, you need to enter the
All-Japan Tournament and win.

330
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,453
It's the first step towards the Bartelana Olympics.

331
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,371
Grandpa I

332
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:36,963
And, we'll practice even harder. Cuvrfenw
is tSPM. Morning and might practicqs
will be t: hours total per day.



333
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:42,677
Of course, men are furbiuddgn! I will get
rid of any guy who tries to get near you!

334
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,055
Grandpa, thank you!

335
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,561
If you're still wimpy Nike this, the Olympic gold
medal will anly be a dream of a dream!

336
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:57,067
No matter what happens, it seems like
things keep going Grandpa's way.

337
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:02,197
Really? mokuma Yawara entered
the All-Japan Tournament?

338
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,365
Matsuda-san!

339
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,491
Yeah !

340
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:09,287
I wondered what Yawam-san was going to
do with judo aftur becoming a Mitsuzba
college student, but this ii her answer!

341
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,165
Huey Kousaku, what is the All-Japan Tournament?

342
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:18,004
As the name goes. it's the only open-weight
class towmament that truuly determines
Japan's best judo athletes!

343
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:22,509
So the rivalry between her and Hon'ami
Sayaka willll be settled there, right?

344
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,678
Tohdoh Yuki wi.l l come back
with a vengeance, Loo:

345
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:30,141
Yeah, but there's another athlete
that's itching to defeat Yawam!

346
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,185
Was there another girl?

347
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,938


348
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,983
She's Saika'i College's judo team
captain, Kousaka Megutm'

349
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,867
Koumkamkuln. Are you really going
to fight linokuma Yawara?

350
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,081
After she diyrespectfully rejected our colleges
scholarship offer, I can't just let her go.

351
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,794
l have my pride as the SaaiXkai College's
judo team captain, too.

352
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:02,382
But, defeating lwnokuma Yawara
is rather impossible.

353
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,509
There is one way.

354
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:13,768
I"m going to teach hnokuma Yawara a
lasson and show her the mighty strength
cuf the Saikai Colllege judo team!

355
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:23,445


356
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:27,073
Next episode is finally thg start
of the All-Japan Tournament.

357
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:27,157


358
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,743
Geez. I have to do another match again.

359
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,244
Yawara. don't glanck Cuff!

360
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:31,411


361
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,747
Not only are Tohdoh Yuk? and Hon'ami
Savaka wanting to defeat you,

362
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:33,872


363
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,917
but everyone else in the tournament
wants to do the same also.

364
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,795
Am I being controlled by Grandpa, after all?

365
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,172
Hey, are you listening, Yawaura?

366
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:42,297


367
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,549
Will I be able to have a normal college life?

368
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:45,300


369
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,259
Next time, on "Yawawra" --

370
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:46,676


371
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,260
"The Stage Contest of the Rivals"

372
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,094
"The Stage Contest of the Rivals"

373
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:48,219


374
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,930
I'll do an ude-rgmrami on those who don't watch!
