00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:51,147

I had hoped that she'd came to my
Saik'an College's Judo team...

56
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,026


57
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:59,489

enthusiasm rub off onto Yawara.

185
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,295
lut's okay. The tea I hand this
morning had a chmbashira!

186
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,221

187
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:45,186


188
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,896
YumJ Osae Mum!



189
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:52,819
Compared to the flashilness of Yawaara-san and
others, Kouiaka Megumi seems so dull.

190
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:52,902


191
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,946
Is She reaily strong, Kausaku?

192
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,576
It's true that she doesn't have any trademark
moves like Yawarmsan's Lppon zeoi.

193
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,035


194
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:07,042
But, her rathel plain strength and skill comes
from her long history of judo ma-tch experiences
and meticulous research methods.

195
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:07,876


196
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,294
But, than what's scary about her

197
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:09,502
But, that's whats scary about her

198
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:09,669


199
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,837
Ilppon! End of match!

200
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,513
Training Hmhmi. llnokuma, and Tohdouh,
the veteran, Kousaka Meguxrm', has
easily cleared the first round!

201
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,226
Hanazano-ian hasnt returned home yet.

202
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,771
They navenT heard back from mm, eithmr

203
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,522
Th at's Wei-rd.

204
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,942
The entrance exam results should
have been posted alreadv.

205
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,028
The entrance exam results of FAILURES, right?

206
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:35,820


207
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,989
Suadah-kun! Don't say such unlucky things!

208
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,908
Yawararsan, what are you doing?

209
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,206
Don't greet me now. Your
match is about to mart!

210
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,458
Don't yau date lose by dzfaulu

211
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,044
Geez, I can't leave you alone for a second!

212
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,837
Bum, Hanazonomkun...

213
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,088


214
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,549
You just need to concentrate on your matches.

215
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:56,633


216
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,592
Come on, let's go.

217
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,637
The newspaper reporter dude is righL

218
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,514
Don't worry about him, Yawara-chan.

219
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,516
We're here for him.

220
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,643
You need to go,

221
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:06,976


222
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,603
Okay, I'm counting on...

223
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,479
Hurry !

224
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,439


225
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,399
Mantsundan-sam !

226
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,987


227
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,613
Ippon !

228
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:23,618
She did it again! lnokwmak ippon
zeal gets better by the minute!

229
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,641
The All-Japan Womenfs Judo Tournament
has become quite interesting."

230
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:54,816
wand as predicted, the fight for the
championship is between the stronger athletes,
Hon'ami, linokulma, Tohdah, and Kousakav

231
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,275


232
00:12:55,275 --> 00:13:02,032
Jigoro-sensei, this quarter-final match is between
my Kousaka Megumi and your Yawara-san.

233
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:02,824


234
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:10,040
I haven't told you yet, but aftet meticulously
researching Yawara-san, my Kousaka
has developed some sort of plan.

235
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,373


236
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,252
Oh? Did she plant some land mines or grenades?

237
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:14,502


238
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,254
But, Vawara will win anyway.

239
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:22,093
Listpn Yawara-san, be really tareful
of Kousaka Megumi, okay?

240
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,306
She's a consists-nth strung"

241
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,893
Are you listening?! Hey!

242
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,271
Yawara-san! It's Hanamnmsan!

243
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,191
What? Mama'udavsan, exam! me.

244
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,526
W... w... wait!

245
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,235


246
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,739
Matsuda-san, than enough Interviewing.

247
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,156


248
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,034
YouTe putting too much pressure on Yawara-san.

249
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,161
I wasn't interviewing her!

250
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,746
Iwas .. I was...'

251
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,081
Enough already!

252
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:57,337
I hate Yawaula m Sayanka or whoevet rudely
stcnnm into the judo world
acting all mg and stuff.

253
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,714
Whu do they think the queer. af Judo is anyway!?

254
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,299


255
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,053
You're the one acting big with
that huge face  TODD-sen.

256
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,181
How many times do I need
to tell you? It's TOAHDOH!

257
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,809
T... Tohdoh-sam, cairn down; Calm down.

258
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:11,351


259
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:19,192
Yum need to understand that a queen needs to be
gracefuln classy. and beautiful. Jmt like me.

260
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:19,359


261
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,193
What dmd you say?!

262
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,488
The queen of judo needs to be
powerful, Intense. and heavy!

263
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,450
I gained iOkg since I last fought you!

264
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:27,534


265
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:32,622
I"ll grind that snobby face of yours
Into the tatami mats this time!

266
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:39,462
No matter how heavy you become,
I'm not even concerned about you.

267
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,005
No matter how heavy you become,
I'm not even concerned about you.

268
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,756
My andy concern is...

269
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:43,925
Yes.

270
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,301


271
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:54,352
Kousavka-san, what are your: plans on fighting
the most popular and strongest girl,
lnokuma Yawara? We're curious.

272
00:14:54,602 --> 00:15:00,817
Since ghe rejected joining you: Saikai
College's judo team, as the capxm'n,
yloulr pride is on the line. isv'n't it?

273
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,652
So, what's yowr plan of attack?

274
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,199
l willl just do my style of qudo
to the hen of my abilities.

275
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:13,204
If I do that, I'm swre I'll have a great fight
against this person called Imokuma.

276
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,205


277
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:14,831


278
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,832


279
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,043
"This person called lnokuma"?

280
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:18,543


281
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,879
TODOfsan, who is that peraon?

282
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,588


283
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,506
You art Like such an amateur!

284
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,801
She seems so mnfident

285
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,011


286
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,015
No, it's more of a tenacity than confidence,

287
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:37,937
It figures, since she's a regufar middle-weight
contender in Japan and fought through.

288
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:42,484
mall the pressures of competing
at world-class tournaments...

289
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:48,615
A kind of tenacity grown from the deep
knowledge and love of judo
and the desire to win.

290
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,200


291
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,326
Thats the big difference.

292
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:51,534
That's the big difference.

293
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,081
It's the one thing Yawarmsan lacks,

294
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:56,873


295
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,293
I see. That's too bad, but don"t
get mo depressed by it.

296
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,462


297
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,004
Bunch!

298
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:10,512
Oh well, lnokuma. I. Hanamnno Kaoru, wiIH not
get depregsed by failing a college or two.

299
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,305
Don't worry about me.

300
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,145
That's right, Handwno-sempai Saikai
College isn't the only college.

301
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:19,312


302
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:24,317
Oh yeah, Yawara-mn, your next opponent
IS Saikai Col'lege's Kousankm right?

303
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:24,651


304
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:30,240
If you throw Kousaka, WOIU'Indn't it be like
getting revenge for Hanazono-san?

305
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,157
That's true.

306
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:31,241


307
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:35,120
Yawara-san. do youlr best and avenge
Hanazonmsaan's defeat!

308
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,203


309
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,538
Please, Yawarawsan!

310
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,456
Huey, wait a mv-nuute.

311
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,708
Van fools!

312
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:46,881
How could you think about using l-nokJuma's
sacred match for revenge! Repen-t
for such unethical absurdities!

313
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,176
I. Hanazonn, will not swap that low!

314
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,928
You guys better...

315
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,769
No, lnokuma! They're ridiculing your judo!

316
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,646
No, they're nox!

317
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,235
Geez, she'd better do some judo seriously.

318
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:07,986


319
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:13,867
This quarter-final match is
one that cannot be missed!

320
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,536
lnokuma Yawara vs. Kousaka Megumi!

321
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:16,995


322
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:24,461
How will the world-class veteran Kousaka Megumi
fight the popular rookie: Momma Yawaxra?

323
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,045


324
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:30,759
This is a Fight that wfl'l redefine
Japan's female judo world!

325
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,770
Ah, it stinks from all the sweat!
Ahh,.. haw bothersome-l

326
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,399


327
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:46,900
Bow!

328
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,696
Inokuma Yawara's trademark ippon zeov'

329
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:56,076
Her big flashy move leaves a memorable
impression upon everyone

330
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,003
But judo isn't just a show or presentation.

331
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,673
The bigger, flashier moves have bigger
openings for counter attacks.

332
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,343
l'll fight with a dull, meticulous
style against her showy style.

333
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:19,974
The moment Inokuma goes for the ippon
zeoi and leaves her back open...

334
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,852
...l'l! wrap my left arm around her neck.
and grab her collar with my right arm...

335
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,103


336
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,189
;..then fall back Immediately. then lock down
her lower bndy with an ok-uri eri-jime!

337
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:32,821
Begin I

338
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,114


339
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,367
The match between Inokuma Yawanra
and Kauvsalka Megumi has begun"

340
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:37,951


341
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,120
Which one will the gaddes: of victory smile uipzon?

342
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,870


343
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,040
Is it difficudit to attack? They
seem to be Feeling around.

344
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,922
Come on and try that move
on me, Inokuma Yawara!

345
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:52,882
She feLl for it!

346
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,259
Oh no!

347
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,345


348
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:57,846


349
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,015


350
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:00,974
Oo-uchi gari?!

351
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,478
O.. oh na!

352
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,574
mppon' End of match!

353
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,786
Awesome! Just uLterly awesome!


354
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:26,541
Inoku'ma Yawawal Her ixpupun Leo-i was
like a flash of thunder and l?ightn.ing"

355
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,253


356
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,547
I totally underestimated.

357
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:32,797


358
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:37,385
I neglected to buy more snacks
before watching this match.

359
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,930

00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,089

Inokuma Yawara's Jludo ian't just flatly

00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,302


385
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:08,476
Underneath all the flashmess, she has the hidden
sense of flexmbniiity and innovative Skills.

Inukuma-san, I'll go ahead and wait
for you in the final roulnd.

403
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:09,704
Defeating you to become the queen of
Japan judo will be the best way to adorn
my Last match while in high school.

404
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:15,210
And everything will be settled once and
for all, and the drama will climax.

405
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,882
In other words, Kazamtsuriwaan and I
will tie the knot far a happy ending!

406
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:27,681

plan, right, Kaza-mmgUIri-san?

00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:32,644

Th... they aay that life is a drama withaut
a plan, right, Yawara-Aian?

409
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:36,815


410
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:37,565
What?

411
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:47,534
We're now into the semi-final round for the
All-Japan Women's Judo Tournament.

412
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:54,082
The fight between the two athletes
wishing to defeat Inokuma Yawara...
Han'armi Sayaka and Tor-duh Yuki!

413
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,919


414
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,087
Miss !

415
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,174

416
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,384

00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:11,725

00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,518
Bur Yawara will wm anyway

419
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:24,154

00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:26,406


422
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,826
Thus first match is between Miss
Saymka and Tohdoh Yuxk'i.

423
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,747
Both of them were so intensely scary
during the apenn'ng ceremony.

424
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:34,080


425
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,334
What are ywu saying, Yawam? Intensity
for a er-or-dsamh match is the
true spirit of a Judo athlete

426
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,710
What are you saying, Yawaxra? Intensity
for a life-or-death match is the
true spm't of a judo athlete

427
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,835


428
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,963
In fact, your ilrudiifferanxt attitude about it
is the acne that should be questioned.

429
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:42,255


430
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,757
Oh rm, SayHKa-san is abom to lose!

431
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,507


432
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,467
Next time  can ,Yawa-ra" --

433
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:45,967


434
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,427
"The Miss' Tenacity"

435
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,347
I'LI do a tomne-nage on those who don: watch!
