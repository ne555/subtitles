1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:30,840


2
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:35,720
I hate this!

3
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,181
I got her!

4
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,232
That's what you get for slacking
off during the march

5
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,151
She probably can! do tomorrow's exam.

6
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,820
What should I do?

7
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,324
I can't hold the pencil for the exam tomorrow.

8
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,325


9
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,454
I sprained my right hand.

10
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,996
Oh wow'




11
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,081
It must have snowed all night...

12
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,342
Grand pa .

13
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,891
What are you sneaking around for?

14
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,934
Umm...

15
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,567
That should make it all better.

16
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,030
I applied my personml blend of dehydrated
green tree frog balm.

17
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:21,451
It'll numb out any pain you get fram your spfa-in.

18
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,452
Really?

19
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,079


20
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,580
That last match was -

21
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,831
I'm so glad!

22
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,625
Hey, stop it now!

23
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,048
Despite what you do and say, you still
care about me, don't you, Grandpa?

24
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,634
I told you to stop it!

25
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,051


26
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,469
Eii, now go!

27
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:39,678


28
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,807
Even if the paax'ln's gone, it won't do you any
good if you re late for the entrance exam.

29
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,266
Okay.

30
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:50,313
Thank you, Grandpa, for allowing me
to take- the women's college exam.

31
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:56,653
A judo athlete stands by his words. You can take
the exam because yuu've fulfilled youlr part
of the agreement to do that tournament.

32
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,905
Grandpa

33
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,949


34
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,200
Did you forget anything?

35
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,703
Do you have your exam IID?

36
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,663
Yes, I do, I'll be okay.

37
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,540
Take cam  okay?

38
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,125
I will!

39
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,837
I'll go do my best!

40
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,463
Good luck!

41
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:22,762


42
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,147
Right. That's important.

43
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,441
This will! surely be on the exam.


44
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,447
Kazamatsuri-san, it's finally time.

45
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:55,628
Exam ID numbers wo-aoo will
go to the eastside Budldiing Z.

46
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:55,962


47
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,215
ID numbers Sim-SOD will go to Building E.

48
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,342
I repeat...

49
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,305
Bu-i-lding b is that large building over there.

50
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:05,889


51
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,390
Thank you.


52
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:17,567
Wow. There's a lot more people
taking it than I expected.

53
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,626
This is it.

54
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,669


55
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,712
I wonder if my right hand will work.

56
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,893
Okay, begin.

57
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,066
Kazamatsuri-san, please watch over me

58
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:01,986
You awe he?

59
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,822


60
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,031
Good morning, ileep'y head.

61
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,367
I'm borrowing this. okay?

62
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:08,993
Huh? Sure.

63
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,622
You looked so peaceful in your sleep.

64
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:17,043
Well, it's because I finished up my
dissertation, I found a job...

65
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,753
And you're now engaged."

66
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,548
That's not true at all!

67
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,509


68
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,261
And, ahe's just a high school girl.

69
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:26,720


70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,389
Too mung for me. Way beyond my reach

71
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391


72
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,769
But she's going to be in college this spring, right?

73
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,061


74
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,940
That's right. I forgot. Sayaka-san
is going to college.,.

75
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,109
.V.which means that Yawara-san will go, too...

76
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,776


77
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,905
So you're saying that you won't touch high school
girls, but will go after college women?

78
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,287
Both of them will finally be within my reach!

79
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,832
Oh yeah, isn't today Yawara-san's exam day?

80
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,751
Do your best, Yawara-san!

81
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,462
If you succeed, you'll be a
graceful college woman",


82
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,634
He's thinking dirty again

83
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,980
Here you go. You dropped this.

84
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,565
Thank you.

85
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,526
You look pale...

86
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,904
I'm all right.

87
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,738
Okay

88
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,245
What's wrong, Grandpa?

89
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,125
Your medicine has never failed
me before, so whym?

90
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,672


91
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:48,176
What's wrong? Not only is the pain
not going away, it's getting worse.

92
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,678
Grandpa?

93
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,012


94
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,347
Forgive me, Yawara

95
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:52,764


96
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,475
It's better for your future this way.

97
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:55,600


98
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,854
Doing judo at Saikav College
is the best choice for you.

99
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,774
You'll surely thank me when
you finally understand that,

100
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:17,997
I can easily treat that minor wrist strain
so that she can at least hold a pencil, but
the medicine I gave her won't work.

101
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,543
Since it's a medicine to treat haemorrhoids.

102
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:30,593


103
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,264
I can barely feel the pencil in my hand.

104
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:46,943


105
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,652
Come on!

106
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,570
M  
m A

107
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,449
If I screw up, then all of my
efforts will be wasted.

108
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,914
Grandpa!

109
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,625
Kazama tsurvlsan!

110
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,379
Anybody' Please help me out!

111
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:06,629


112
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,220
Mauwuuda isn't here?!

113
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,930


114
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,601
Mi'ke Bison": plane is about to land!

115
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,185


116
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,020
Mliike Bison! Mike Bisan!

That Mike Bison is conning to Japan
far a comeback match, too!

118
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,030
Where the heck is he, ditching
this important assignment?!

119
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:42,374


120
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,503
Yawanra is going to Saikam' Callege
and joining the judo team

121
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,505
SE?!

122
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,049
I can't believe what the Gramps said.

123
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:51,841


124
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,637
Yawara-san studied so hard
for this. She's gotta be...

125
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,723


126
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:03,436
If she ends up going to this mi'i-haa coFlege...

127
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,062


128
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,648
...then how will she get the Olympic gold medal?

129
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:06,815


130
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,609
And what will become Olf my main
pursmt as a news reparter?

131
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,777


132
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,531
Hey you. What are you doing here?

133
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:21,621
Wm well, as you can see, I'm just a family
relative of one of the exam students.
I'm not a suaplcjous person at all.

134
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,959
YouTe suspecting me. aren't you?

135

Then tell me your sister's name!

142

Yawara! Oh, my beloved Little sister!

146
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,165
Forget it. Come on.

What happened to your hand?

153
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,323
I have nothing to say to you. Matsuda-ian.

154
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,118
Hey, I'm not here for an interview,

155
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,745
Is that go?

156
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,329


157
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,333
Believe me. I came here for
private reasons. Private.

158
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:48,792


159
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,837
l was half-guessing that you'd be
taking the exams today anyway.

160
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,296


161
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:57,717
l bet you Kulnivchann, your photographer,
is lurking around with a camera.

162
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,426


163
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,761
No, she's not.

164
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,137


165
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,390
You're trying to get an exclusive
scnop from me, aren't you?

166
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,265
No way!

167
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,767
I can't trust you,

168
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:05,850


169
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,976
Please trust me.

170
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,061
No way.

171
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:08,687
P lease !

172
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,399
No! I cant trust newspaper reporters.

173
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:13,858
Listen !

174
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,776


175
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:23,618
Before I'm a newspaper reporter, l"m a human
being! A person! I came here because
I have a peraonnal interest in you!

176
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,800
Uhh, everybody... this isn't anything!

177
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,050


178
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,594
Please go on with your business!

179
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,220


180
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,472
This a just a random famui-ly argument!

181
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,018


182
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,394
I'm going to fail.

183
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,895


184
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,813
W... why?

185
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,653
You sprained your hand in yesterday's match?

186
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,489
I can't hold a pencil because it hurt: too much.

187
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:08,997
I think I barely made it through the morning
exam, but the pain numwbs my brain...

188
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,665

189
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:17,922


190
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,548

00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,382

00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,800
You're going to take it with that hand?

193
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,474


194
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,099
Yawara-saan .

195
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,853
I studied so hard for this.

196

Regardless of the result, I wan't give up.

197
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,691
I'll do my best until the very end.

198
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,193

00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,154

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:15,897


204

There was a tennis ptayer who won the
Wimbledon by tying the racket
to the injured hand,

205
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,904


206

219
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,873

Ymu seem happy. Yawa-ra.

221
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,433

lg it because you did well on the exam wsrerdavy?

223
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,645


224
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:42,067
Not really, but I was able to
give my all because of this

225
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:53,578


226
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,206
Mom, were you attracted to many men at
the same time when you were young?

227
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,332


228
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,542
What? Wh... why do you ask, an of a sudden?

229
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:07,258
Well, when l was young... I suppose
I was attracted to many men.

230
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:07,926


231
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,927
I see.

232
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,136
But. . .

233
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:10,720


234
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,182
After I met your father. he's been
the- on-ly one far me s-iince!

235
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,101
Gosh, you're so lost in your emotions!

236
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,692
Yawara seems so happy.

237
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:23,983


238
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,984
Check .

239
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,944


240
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,569
Hold it

241
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:26,861


242
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,364
You've asked me to hold it In times already.

243
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,658
How many times do I need to do that?

244
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,368
Until I wm, of courset

245
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,329
Gosh!

246
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,288


247
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,667
She couldn't have been able to
hold a pencil with that sprain.

248
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,376


249
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,253
Then how about this?

250
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:52,470
I see! She must have done so bad on her
exams, that she gave up on it entirely!

251
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,181
Okay! Then I should get on it, pronto!

252
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,891

00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:53,615


273
00:17:53,615 --> 00:18:00,455
Oh, I apologizeA It was rude of me to
call such a beautiful girl "nurmaJ".

274
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,835
Well. Yawara will certainly eam

Isn't it a grand occasion?

287
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,125
I've never heard about this.

288
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,085


289
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,963

290
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:50,255


291
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,798
Don't worry about her.

292
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:56,136
This; foolish child just doesn't have enough
confidence to win m Olympic
gold medal yet, that's all.

293
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:56,386


294
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,972
Comma an, let's finish up the final paperwork.

295
00:18:58,972 --> 00:18:59,305


296
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,683
I'm not talking about the Olympics.

297
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,978
Thank you for your scholarship offer.

298
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,729


299
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:09,774
But, I am not going to enroll into Sajkai College.

300
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:09,899


301
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,567
What?!

302
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,659
l toouk the entrance exam for
Mi'tsuba Womens College.

303
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,620
Have they announced the exam results yet?

304
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,288
NO.

305
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,876
This is rather blunt, but what will you
do if you donnT get into that college?

306
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,544
I wiilil take it again next year.

307
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,840
You fool! Nobody will want you to do that!

308
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:40,680
The jludo world, the sports world, and all of the
Japanese citizens wouldn't want you to do that!

309
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,772
I passed, didn't I?

310
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,775


311
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:56,196
Anyhow, I apozloglze for bevng rude,
but this negotiation is off.

312
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,906


313
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,076
What's going on, Innkummsensei?

314
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:01,284


315
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,162
It's a typical girl thing called "selfishness."

316
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:04,329


317
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:09,209
But, don't worry. Sher never

318
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:09,334


319
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,337
B... but. she said that she'll try again next year.

00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,673


321
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,425
I won't ever allow that to happen!

322
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,147
You counldn't do it?!

323

This isn't a grade school homework assignment,
butthe'ad: This is crappy!

324
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,987
Go do it again from the tap!

325
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,614

00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:42,200

333
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,884

So. what is ft?

335
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:01,594

00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:07,684

That must have been hard. Troublesome
things like that happen, don't they?

341
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:15,817
Yes.

342

00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:22,449


347
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,701
That's what's so great about him.

348
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:25,744
Umm...

349
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,079

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,551


373
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,721
Kuniko-san might be a good person, after all.

374
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,018
Is that what happened!

375
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:35,980
Oh, Kausaku?

376
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,150
What are you doing here?

377
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,902
Nothing. Back to work!

378
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:41,861
Nothing. Back to work!

00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,195

380
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,363


381
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,115
At least carry one of these boxes for me!

382
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,662
I'll try the exams again next year. . huh?

383
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,500
What if I fail and have to study for another year?

384
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,586
lpassed, right, Matsuda-san?

385
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,056
I passed, right, Matsuda-san?



386
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:29,159
Yawara's enrollment into the Sailkaj College has
been set, so the food tastes even better!

387
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:29,284


388
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,160

00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:35,081
Grandpa, I told you that I'm
NOT going to Sakai College!

393
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:41,296
Since you definitely failed that Mii-haa College
exam, the only choice left is Saikai College.

394
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,590
It's not of'fmiavl that I failed the exam yet.

395
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,008
But I'm sure you did.

396
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,468
Next time, on "Yawara" --

00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,720
