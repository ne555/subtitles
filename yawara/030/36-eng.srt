1
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,440
lmokwma.

2
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,697
You shine so brilliantly, and you ksep
getting brighter and brighter.

3
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:01,955
You "ll evgntually shine In Japan's...
no, the international judo arena.

4
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,164


5
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:09,087
I'm already fortunate to have spent my
high schoowl life with a person like you.

6
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:18,221
But, stilll... why does my heart
feel so tight and pavinufwl?

7
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,685
The chaser it is to graduation, me tigh-tenr it gets.

8
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:30,233
Did ! fall in love with someone I Shouldn't have?

9
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,737
Are we going to part just like that?

10
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,657
I'm extremely saddened!

11
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,589
"That's the spirit! That's the spirit!"

12
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:57,093
This means 'Kaep it up', 'keep goimg', etc.

13
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,636


14
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,263
Almost graduation, huh?

15
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:00,722


16
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,599
Almost farewell to this school.

17
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,394
It feels like it blew right past us.

18
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:22,786
But watching the underclassmen go to classes
makes me feel like such an
outsider. It's a bit sad.


19
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:34,589
My plans are already set, and just thinking
that I'll be released from the restraints
of high school life makes me so happy!

20
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,927
They should bet us be on vacation
until graduation!

21
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,552


22
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,512
How about you, Kaori?

23
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:45,725
Me? It hasn't really hit me yet

24
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:53,858
Since you associated with underciassmen
in your jIUIdD club, Yawara, you might
have a much stronger feeliiing than us.

25
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,485


26
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,820
Prcbabuly so

27
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:08,081
But! I heard that lots of people start to become
coupies became of the heightened excitement.

28
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,125


29
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,504
There are some couples who went
on graduation tri'ps aaIuready, too.

30
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,090
Guess what they graduated from...

31
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,011
Oh gosh! Wow! No way!

32
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,096
Sorry guys!

33
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,973


34
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,807
You're late.

35
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,477
Scurry, sorry. It was the last guidance
counseling, so it dragged a bit.

36
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:29,978


37
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,312
Mao big deal.

38
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,023
Well then.

39
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,859
Oh yeah. let's go eat at the Tokoro-ten!

40
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,277
Sure!

41
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,238
Said it am at the same time!

42
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,664
C... calm down. Ca-Ilm down, Hanazono Kaoru..

43
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,584
Be a man and go for it, head on!

44
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,673
Look at that fool. Hue leaks like a gate ornament.

45
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,216


46
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,760
It's Hanazono-kunA

47
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,804


48
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,222
Hey, Hannazonuvkun.

49
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,893
M. . . Matsuda-san..

50
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,435


51
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,270
What's making you so jumpy?

52
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,731
N . . . nothing, really.

53
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,315


54
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
O'h, are yOu interviewing Itnnksuma?

55
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:17,817


56
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,944
Yeah, since it's almost graduatim.

57
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,195


58
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,197
I wanted to ask her about her future plans.


59
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:27,327
Oh hey, speak of the devil... the
superaar is coming this way!

60
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,704
Oh gosh, it's already this late!

61
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,955
Oh gosh, it's already this late!

63
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,248


64
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,708
Wenlll, exruse me.

65
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,712
Hanazonowkun is such an interesting boy.

66
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:37,962


67
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:47,138


68
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:57,732


69
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,235
Ohh gosh!

70
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:00,902


71
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,322
Every single newspaper has Yawara,
Yawara, Inokuma Vawaira!

72
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,700
What's so special about her anyway?

73
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,243



74
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:14,332
Aren't they fmrgetting that she won because
my leg was injured and I had to forfeit?

75
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,711
She's unbelievably lucky!

76
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:18,878
Sayavka-sank

77
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,971
You'll always be iurritalted if you keep
reading those newapapers.

78
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,889


79
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,808
V... yes, but...

80
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,517


81
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,271
Yaur first priority is m heal your leg.

82
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,188


83
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,525
You"ll surely have another chance
to go age-inst Yarwara-san.

84
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:40,859


85
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,193
Th... that's true.

86
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,615
I need to hsal my leg filrst before I
can fight I'nokuma Yawara again.

00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,954


128
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,581
I have nothing left to do here.

129
00:08:59,581 --> 00:08:59,748


130
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,332
But?

131
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,460
Olh, nothing.

132
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,046


133
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,174
You're sad that you courldn't
have Yawarawcham, right?

134
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,219
D... don't say such a disgusting thing!

00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,474
Sudah, I'm not like you!

136
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:23,188


137
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,192
I'm just regretting the fact that I've
never fought against lnokuma.

138
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,694
What, age-inst Yarwara-san?!

00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,278


140

Well, we always saw how strong
Yawaraaa-n is, but...

141
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,993


142
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:42,040
...I can understand sempai'es
desire to experience it.

143
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:46,628
But, you mmght also end up in the Hospital.

00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,214


145
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,467
Since it is Yawarmsan.

146
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,385


147
00:09:53,385 --> 00:10:01,851
In other words, Hhannnazorro-sempaj wants to enjoy
the last few days in high school by using judo
as an excuse to fondle Yawa'rahchaan!

148
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,019

00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:57,944

You guys?

206
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:11,708


207
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,793
Stop practicing so hard.

208
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,336


209
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:21,551
We went to your house, doubting what you
said, but they said that yau were here so...

210
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:21,926


211
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,680
Sempal, are you really going to fight Yawara-sam?

212
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:25,930


213
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,725
There's a sa'yingw "A mass after
a year, shall cruwmbxle a rack."

214
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,810


215
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,645
This is Haunazono Kanoru's last bet.

216
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,104


217
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,022
Bet?

218
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,106


219
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,399
Oh, nothing.

220
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,734


221
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,568
That's impossible!

222
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:38,777


223
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,614
Though Yawara-san may be female, you're-
gmung up against the All-Japan champ!

224
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,615


225
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,533
Yeah, Ha-nazono-senmpai.

226
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:45,909


227
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:51,831
If you fight her, yau'll get
broken bones and more

228
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,957
"xx

229
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:58,963
lit is my personal choice to fight
hnnkuma. Dani butt in.

230
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,640
Hua-nazono-senmpaj is serious about this.

231
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,184
Nobody can stop him when he makes up his mind.

232
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,186


233
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,607
But, we won't be able to see
him take that anymore.

234
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:17,941


235
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,194
We sunre followed him for all these years.

236
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,278


237
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:28,284
When I booked at my older sisters magazine.
there was an article about the characteristics

of pathetic guys.

238
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:28,743


239
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:33,415
"Bad fashion taste
to talk arbour...

. "Having nothing
'Unsan-itary". . .

240
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,500
And, "Pasty white skin",..

241
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,878
Sempa-i has all those characteristics.

242
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,379


243
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,297
He's not unsanitary, is he?

244
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:41,506


245
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,299
He mink: from sweat!

246
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:48,847
He sweats profusely, and to make it wotse,
there's no showers in the club room
for him to use after practice.

247
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,264


248
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:54,394
Weren't you the one saying that his feet
smelled so bad that you had to puke?

249
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,192
Bux, we kind of have those characteristics, too,

250
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,694
Don't say that.

251
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,824
We don't think weTe pathetic, buut
evenrynne else thinks otherwise.

252
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,953
Let  em say what they wan-t ta

253
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,001
Doi-ng judo. we ve acquitted ourselves weIl, right?

254
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,005
Don't you think we've done mare
than the average dude?

255
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,090
Th-mk about it.

256
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,303
We had judo'x superstar, Yawaura-chan, coach us,

257
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:34,768
Which makes youu guys, Hanazono-sempai,
and myaelf, rather special, right?

258
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,981
Yeah, I suppose.

259
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:49,574
With Yawara-chain and Hanazono-sempai
graduating, we'll have tn keep up
the tradition in this judo club!

260
00:15:49,574 --> 00:16:03,755


261
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,093
Everyone.

262
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:18,436
Ah... ah... testing, testing.

263
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,145


264
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,188
Okay! Okay!

265
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,232
These three years went by so fast.

266
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,401

00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,073

270
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,452

00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,706
You guys should gran practicing

272
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,249

rangr: of makeup items!

274
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,046

Hay, hey, Yawara-chanm Give me a nice look

Sorry if I have a weird face!

284
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,665
Oh, what's with that attitude? She's so snobby!

285
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,124


286
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:25,628
Hey, Kousaku! Kousalku!

00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,463

00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,883
Why do I have to answer your questian?

289
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,969
It's not my question. E verymne's itching to know.

Yeah, and he always wears the
same clothes. Pathetic.

00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,401

00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,117

00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,785
It's not embarrassing

330
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,371


331
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,873
It's not embarrassing!

332
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:25,206


333
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:31,338
Before you cannne, Yaw-ara-san. we were
so pathetically weak, and couldn't
even win past the first raulnd.

334
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:31,755


335
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:37,260
The other sports dubs made fun of
us, and we never said it, but we thought
about quitting so many times.

336
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,055
The other sports clubs made fun of
us, and we never said it, but we though-t
about quitting so many times.

337
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,975
We're embarrassed to admit that,
more than anything else.

338
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,268


339
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,311


340
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,731
But, after you coached us,
Yawara-san. we changed.

341
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,315


342
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:55,862
We started to feel as though
we're doing real judo mow.

343
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:04,204
We got a Hide more confident, won a
little, and couldn't believe that we
even thought of quitting back then.

344
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,331


345
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:10,251
We're really enjoying ITt' lit's really fumilling'!
