00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:06,514


82
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,476
Gee, don't make me say such
embarrassing things.

83
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,520
Embarrassing?

84
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,817
You're a yet-to-be married girL
Why are you doing this?

85
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:18,860
Yau're so cruel.

86
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,822
YoUre the one that invited me over.

87
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,782


88
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,826

90
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,790
I don't recall anything.

91
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:38,213
But. Kousaku.... you're accusing
me of being... a slut...

92
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,761
l... Fm sorry! It's my fault! I'H do
anything, so please forgive me!

93
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,682
Will you really do anything?

94
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,058


95
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:50,892
Really?

00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:58,191
W... well... we shoulld go to

97
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,068
G. .. goodnight!

98
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,573
Liar!

00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:07,992
Goodnight!

100
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,412
Liar!

101
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,247
Liar !

102
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,917
Liar!

103
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,714


104
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,051
What do you think you're doing
spacung out during practice!

105
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,885


106
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:31,349
You were studying all night for that
useless exam again, weren't you?

107
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:31,599


108
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,183
Geez!

109
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:32,559


110
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm probably the only one being
yelled at for studying so hard!

111
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,900
I know that I've agreed to let you take the
exam for the MIl-HAA Women's College.

112
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,359


113
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,278
It's Mitsuba Women's Cotlege!

114
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,825
But, you have to be in the upcoming
tournament to do that.

115
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,492


116
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,244
I know that already.

117
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:55,206
Good. Now let's get back to practice.

118
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,332
Come on, Varwaura!

119
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:56,958
Yes!

120
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,417
MW ,

121
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:57,584


122
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,753


123
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,213
I'll practice, and do the tournament.

124
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,468
But, HI study hard, too!

125
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:13,516


126
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,060
My head hurts!

127
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,192
'Tm Sorry about last night. Kuznliiko"

128
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,362
So, she's sort of nice, after all.

129
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,572
I heard that!

130
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,823


131
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,033
Vau're stiill here?

132
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,159


133
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,245
Matsuda-san, you actually have
feelings for me, don't you?

134
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,957


135
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,376
Y... yes, yes!

136
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,210


137
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,211
This is Matsuda.

138
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,130
What time do you think it is nght rmw!? You fool!

139
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,216
Why don't you just ditch work?

140
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:46,925
Hey, shut up!

141
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,843
Why you!

142
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:53,431
How dare you play around with women
and skilp work at a time like this!

143
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:53,973


144
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,976
So, Kuwniko-san stayed over, after all

145
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,769


146
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,355
We lost all respect for you, Matsuda-saln!

147
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,274


148
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:09,197
Sorry to bother your fun, playboy, but clean
out youwr ears for what Pm going to say'

149
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,284
What? Yawawra-san is going to be
in the Zemoonki Tournament!

150
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,122
You can't have time to play with
wamen! Get some work done!

151
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,751
Why in the world are you bawling?

152
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,463
ow: yeah!

153
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,256


154
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:32,762
I thought that Yawmra-san gave up
an judo to study for the college entrance
exams, but I was wrong!

155
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:37,726
Her prospects of going to the Barcelona
Olympics are possible now!

156
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,853
What are you so excited about, Kousaku?

157
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:39,936
Wait.
What are you so excited about, Knusaku?

158
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,311
Wali't.

159
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:43,940


160
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,739
Zen-cold Tournament is on... the day before
her Mitsuba College entrance exam.

161
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,658
Did she give up on her studies?

162
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,871
You're such a WOfkthO-IIC. I'm so jealuus.

163
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,039


164
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,081
Stop it!

165
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:00,498


166
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,791
I dan't have tmme far this!

167
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,125


168
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,043
Where are you going?

169
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,879
To work, of course!

170
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,339
What about breakfam?

171
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,215
PM eat it when I get back.

172
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:10,967
Geez.

173
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,094
What?

174
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,431
lmokuma Ya-wara has entered
the Zen ooki Tournament?

175
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,184
Is that true, Takuxnagksan?

176
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,479
We can finally settle this once and for all.

177
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:29,194
But, we missed the deadline for entries.


178
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,738
Well, chars too bad.

179
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,115
We missed the goiden opportunity
for a great match.

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,744
Deadlines aren't a problem.

181
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,205
How much do we need to pay?

182
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,750
Well, money can't change this situation around.

183
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,168
Right, Tokunagavsan?

184
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,170


185
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,509
Why? Why cant money solve it?



186
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:59,849
Our Hownami Grouwa wealth and influence
should be ab-he to override a
petty tournament's deadline.

187
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:06,106
Tokunaga, check who sponsored the tournament.
We'll pay them whatever they want.

188
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,068
Y... yes, I'll try.

189
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:16,408
So, we can finally settle this duel,
cant we, Kazamatsuriwaaan?

190
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,493
Yes, I suppose so.

191
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,162
Yeah, she's in ft.

192
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:21,788


193
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,915
Want some dried potatoes? They're great!

194
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,374


195
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,127
Thank you. So it's true?

196
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:27,752


197
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:33,341
If she fuat bays around. she won't be
able to get a gold medal, much less,
go to the Barcelona Oiympics.

198
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:33,466


199
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,175
That's true.

200
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,802
Relax .

201
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:42,267
I won't hide her anymore. She's going
to run straight to the Olympic:

202
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,146
That's the spirit. But, wa-it a minute,

203
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:46,980


204
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,443
The day after the tmurnament is the day of the
Mitsuba Women's College entrance exam.

205
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,986
What's that?

206
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,198
Yawara is going to Saikaui Callege
to joiIn the judo team.

207
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:57,949


208
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,409
That's not what I heard.

209
00:10:59,409 --> 00:10:59,743


210
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,537
Are you sure she agreed to it?

211
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,830
Of course.

212
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,499
Is there any other plan she's supposed to follow?

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,043
Is that w?

214
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,963
But, I thought she really wanted to go to Mftmba.

215
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,176
By the way, who B that lurking behind you?

216
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,510


217
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,972
I'm Kaga Kuwn-iko. Just call me Kuni-chan.

218
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,099
Kun'i  .. Chan?

219
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,268
Why did you follow me?

220
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,396
Because we function as one
unit. The inseparable pair!

221
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:28,480
What the hell?

Because we function as one
unit. The inseparable pair!

222
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,272
What the hell?

223
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,817
I'm the Daily Every Sports' new photographer!

224
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:32,942


225
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,363
Nice... to... meet... you!

226
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,453
Well. such impressive breasts!

227
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:43,787


228
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,247
Gosh, Grandpa...

229
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:46,456


230
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,376
Matsuxda, come here.

231
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,711
Did you touch them yet?

232
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,504
What?

233
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,968
Well, it seems Hike you're still
in the hornaeymoon stage!

234
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,427
Weill, it seems like you're still
in the honeymoon stage!

235
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,304
ah, can you tell?

236
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,431
Tel-l what? What?

237
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,474
I"m home!

238
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,684


239
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,436
Hi, Yawara-chawn! How are you?

240
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,272
Good afternoon.

241
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,108
.A hi.

242
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,277
He tanllks about you all day long,

243
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:16,486


244
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,489
You're such a warkaholinc, Kousaku.

245
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,865
I told yuu to stop calling me that!

246
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:20,949


247
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,076
But we're no longer strangers.

248
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:23,910
Hey!

249
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,913
You were so wild the other night, Kozusaku!

250
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,458
H... how obscene!

251
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:30,750


252
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,505
N... no, I was drunk, s... so...

253
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,132
I see.

254
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:37,507


255
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,428
ITS gmat that you found such a wanderful
girifriend, Matsuda-san.

256
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:41,720


257
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,388
No, it was just. .

258
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,180


259
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,516
Don't hold back the truth, Kousakum

260
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,519


261
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,272
Come on, Grandpa. Let's start
practice before it gets dark.

262
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,314


263
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,024
Sure .

264
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,404
With the tournament coming up,
Yawara is finally getting fired up.

265
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,156
Well, good luck to you guys, too.

266
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,574


267
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,284
Yawara-san! Inokuma'san!

268
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:04,909


269
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,619
W... wait a minute!

270
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:06,745


271
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,204
vaye!

272
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,208


273
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:12,959
What a pervert!

274
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,501


275
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:19,341
So I'm not sexy... and have tiny breasts!

276
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,013
That's it; That's the spirit, Yawaura!

277
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,828
I told you that it wounldn't work.

278
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:55,752
I don't understand why I can't be in the
tuumavment, even after offering
that much money.

279
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,378


280
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,339
Money isn't the issue here.

281
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,340


282
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,096
She's so lucky. I"m so appalled
than: Pm xpeechless.

283
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,521
It's been a while since hnokuma
Yawen'a's last appearance

284
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,691
Is she finally gearing up in preparation
for the Bane-Iona Olympics?

285
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,653
Inokvuma Yawara made her debut as a
national champ last year by storm.

286
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,195


287
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:27,784
But she needs more wins no go to the
Barcelona Olympics, so aha can't
afford to base this tournament.

288
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,661
Well then.

289
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,707
I need to get this tournament over with,
and get ready for the exam tomorrow.

290
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,040


291
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,582
Yawara-sam .

292
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,212
Knuock 'em dead h':ke you always do! Go get 'em!

293
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,300
Yawaramhan, do your best!

294
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,384


295
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,386
I lI be cheering for you with Kousmku!

296
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:46,636


297
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,931
Because we're like one unit, and
the best couple around, right?

298
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,140


299
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,725
Right. Kousaku?

300
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,643
I told you to stop calling me that!

301
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:57,230
Gosh, you're so bashful, Kousaku!

302
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:58,940
What a pervert!

303
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,900
Messing around on the job!

304
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,235
Bow!

305
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,029


306
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,239
What a shabby tournament arena.

307
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,157


308
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:13,288
The doghuouse of my belaved dog, Charles, is
better than this dump, right, Kazamatsuri-san?

309
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:13,955
Heh?

310
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,458
Sayaykaisan. Kazamatsuiri-san.

311
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,841
Hran'awmdwsan, may we ilnztenrview you?

312
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,216


313
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,343
Just one comment please.

314
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:26,676


315
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,552
What are your thoughts?

316
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,807
Inokuma-san. I'm here- to praise you.

317
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:37,270
You must be relimd that I'm not
in this tournament, correct?

318
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,604


319
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,732
I, Savyaakaa am so happy for you!

320
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:47,906
That Miss Sayaka couldn't help
but come out here, huh?

321
00:15:48,448 --> 00:16:00,835
But, I feel sorry for the spectators, because a
tournament without me is like an opera without
a prima donna or a lake without a swan.

322
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:08,051
And so, l"ll just stay here and watch Inokuma-san
do this minor tournament.

323
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:08,718


324
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,429
With my fiancEE Kazamatsuwri-san.

325
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,975
Please do your best, Yawara-san.

326
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,940
What kind af praise was that?
That Miss is so mean!

327
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,273


328
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:27,946
That Kazamatsuri, too! He knows how
Yawara-san feels about him,
yet he comes out like that!

329
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:28,947
Why that...!

330
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,575
Don't leave me by myself, Kousaku.

331
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:32,659
Let go of me, stupid!
Don't leave me by myself, Kousaku.

332
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,868
Let go of me, stupid!

333
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:33,952
Let go of me, stupid!
Nu!

334
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:34,452
Nu!

335
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,203
Begin !

336
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,841
Why 's everyone only noticing Yawara?

337
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,844
VouTe not the only one in this tournament!

338
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,813
Everyone seems so happy.
But, I'm stuck with this.

339
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:08,862
Yukc!

340
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,615
What's wrong with Inakuma Vawara?

341
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,285
She's being pushed around
by Kobayasm, an degree

342
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,788
You big fool!

343
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,540


344
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,124
Jyogai!

345
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,252
lnakwma got away by getting out of bowunudi

346
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:29,174
Maybe she's not back in top-shape, since she's
already in a pinch with a yuko scored against her.

347
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,052
This match isn't predictable anymore.

348
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,138


349
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,349
What's wrong? Straighten up!

350
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,933


351
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:43,104
That's right. Kousaku and I are rooting for you.

352
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,357
Retuirn to the start position.

353
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:49,944


354
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:50,612
Yawara-sanA

355
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:56,868
It's so embarrassing to fall! dawn by such
a wimpy attack, right, Kazamatswri-san?

356
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,578


357
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:04,042
Why am I the only one sweating
and dodging moves?

358
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:04,501


359
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:04,876
Begin !

360
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:08,672


361
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,590
Why? Why me?

362
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,803


363
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,512
krypton !

364
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,306
Sh... she did i-tl

365
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,892
Her trademark ippan-zeoi!

366
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,436
Inokuma Yawa'ra is truly invincible!

367
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,772
She has easily won the first round!

368
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,358


369
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,610
Yeah! That's it!

370
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,319


371
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,320
Vawara -savn!

372
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,115


373
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,199
I hate this.

374
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:43,039
Idiot! What was that match?

375
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:49,295
You got a yuko scored against you, you were
spacing out, and your throw
was reckless! It sucked:

376
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,672

Either way, Yawara, you're
going to Saikai CoHege.

385
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,958
If you go to Mll-HAA College,
you'll slack off even more

386
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,589


387
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,673

00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,900
Of course she is, Kazamatsuri, because
Sayaaka-san is all over you.

406
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,863
Oh, and who is that rather pmvoca-tive
girl with you, Matsuda-san?

407
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,491
S... she's just an ordinary photographer.

408
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,910
Hey, I"m not just ordinary.

409
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,330

Matsuda-san, have you switched over
from fawara-mn to this permn?

417
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,802
S... switched over?

418
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,472
That's right. Yawara-chan is
simply a business contact.

419
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,350
She's not much of a girl anyway.

420
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,811
My, I absolutely agree.

421
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,771

Women's College, Ogawa Taamami?

427
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,467
Chewing her out like that should do the trick.

428
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,635
Hurry up and win it, Yawara.

429
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,094

You seem really delighted.

453

That's what you get for slacking
off in the match.

00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,961
She probably can't do tomorrow's exam.

456
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:04,092

462
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,577
