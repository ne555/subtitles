00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,892


169
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,937
Hon'ami barely escaped it by going out of bounds.

170
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:48,445
I cannot possibly tose.  . until
I defeatu Inokuma Yawam!

00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:36,538


317
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,040
A right leg fracture with a mm tendon.

318
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,124


319
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,543

00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:49,342

00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:50,802


329
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,888
A handicap like this will batance the scales a b-I't.

330
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,639

You can go do it, but it" com you.

351
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:30,175


352
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:39,059

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:37,701

00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:33,590

00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:37,594


406
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,972
If I don't go, then that Inokuma Yawara
will became the champion!

407
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:41,264


408
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,892

They're waiting for the appearance of the
century's heroine, HonamI Sayaaka!

413
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:53,735


414
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:57,947
What are you saying? What if
you can't do judo anymme?

415
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:04,662
That is irrelevant to me. What's important
right now is to defeat Ilnokuma Yawara.

416
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,209
If I can just defeat that irritating girl.
then I'll gladly sacrifice my leg.

00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,046
I can't waste my time here.
