00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,097
Eii, whats wrong, Yawara?

00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,017

00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:41,768


4
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,729
Grandpa, please.

5
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:44,938


6
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,234
I need to go see the Mitsuba College's
exam results today.

00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,323


10
00:01:55,323 --> 00:02:00,787
As I tald you, Yawavra, I won't avlllnow
yoru tc study For another year.

11
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,121


12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,622
That woubd just be plain ridiculous!

13
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,335
Why do you say that?! Don't run my life!

14
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:12,590
And it's not certain that I'm disqualmed
from Mitsuba College.

15
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,345
Very well then. Do as you like.

16
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,054


17
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,931
I certainly will-L.

18
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:30,608


19
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,819
Geez, Grandpa is so stupid

20
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,571


21
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,364
He never cares about my feelings.

22
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:41,703


23
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,373
But, what if .. Ifailed?

24
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,137
It has to be okay.

25
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,097


26
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,932
Matsuda-san is on my sideV

27
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,269


28
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:13,401
But... Matsuda-san hasn't come.

29
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,405
Wonderful!

30
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:17,530


31
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,657
Why are you taking pictures of the umpire?

32
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,033


33
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,700
What?

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,661
Don't act stuwpid'!

35
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,333
Even if it is just an open season game,
old high school r'rvalls are going against
each other in this pro game!

36
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:33,421
Make may you get shots of the pitcher and
batter, bevfure and after the rival battle!

37
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:33,713


38
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:40,303
But, the pitcher isn't my type, and
the umpire is so halndsame!

39
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:40,512


40
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,722
Gosh darnit. gimme the camera!

00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,101
Your photos aren't news-worthy!

Hey, don't smudge the lens!

43
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,647
Give me something to wipe it with.

44
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,022


45
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:55,860
You have such a short temper, Kousaku.. Here.

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,487


47
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,950
Geez, how could Kamoda ca-tch
a cold at a time like this.

48
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,872
Th... this handkerchuixef...!

49
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,501
H... how'd you get this?

50
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,754
Oh... it's mine.

51
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:21,428
Nope, it's mine! It has a hole here.
see! Why do you have it?

52
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,387


53
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,182
You dan't have to be so scary...

54
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,769


55
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,857
Hey, Daily Every! Stop being
so Iovey-dovey at work!

56
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,065


57
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,402
That's why your publication does'm: grow.

58
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:47,662


59
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,580
What?

60
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,625
Yawara-sann came all the way
to the office tn return this?

61
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,045


62
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,880
I just forgot about it.

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,714


64
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:03,428
And, you alwayg run away when our
eyes meet anyway, Kousaku.

65
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,139


66
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,936
Did she say anything? She wouldn't come all the
way to the office just to return a handkerchief!

67
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,981
She said something?!

68
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,357


69
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:22,572
She did, but I'll only tell yau if you'lil

70
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:22,947

Oh sure, I'll ea-h with ynu any

72
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,747
Really? Realtly? All right!

73
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,081


74
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:36,002
I... I found a neat Mediterranean restaurant!

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,211


76
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:40,173
Kousaku, do you like lobsters? I really

Okay! So what did Yawara-saun say?

78
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,593
Okay! So what did Yawara-sawn say?

79
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,177

Darnit! So the exam resufts are posted today!

85
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,328
Yawara-chan is late.

86
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,414
Oh gosh, a strange man!

87
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,957
That girl failed for sure.

88
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,794
Did she go home already?

89
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,086


90
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,046
Hey, SudohJ

91
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,589


92
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,966
Ha. .. Hanezom-san!

93
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:23,508


94
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:29,222
What is a bacterial fool like you doing
in from of a purely clean and sacredly
forbidden womenis college?

95
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:34,728
Don't pretend to be ignorant, since
you're here for the same reason.

96
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:34,853


97
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:41,026
You want to hold Yawauraschaan's hand when she
happily finds out her exam results, right? Right?

98
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:41,276


99
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,612
And say, "lmokuma, congratuulavtjaons.!"'
then take her down or...

100
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,241
Stop thin-king i-n an absolutely disgusting
and extremely shameless way!

101
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,744
Why are you guys making such a scene?

102
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,537
L .. lnukuma-sensei.

103
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,498
H... hey. isn't Yawarawchan with you?

104
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:55,623


105
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,543
Yawara is probabiy crying
over her failure already.

106
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,047
Now let's go see her hornble exam reswlts.

107
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
Oh, I can't.

108
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,725
I can't see it by myself.

109
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,269


110
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,187
Matsuda-san...

111
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,898
Oh yeah.

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:26,029
Any time I'm in trouble, Grandpa said that
Ishauld imagine that it's a judo match.

113
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:30,617


114
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,242
Begin!

115
00:07:31,242 --> 00:08:05,110


116
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,652
Ma.

117
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,320


118
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,155
Long time no see, Yawaratsan.

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,657


120
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,783
Kazama-ts-ulriwsan !

121
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,158
,;

122
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:12,450


123
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,455
Well, I found out that it was Mitsuzba's exam
results day, so I just had to come.

124
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,081


125
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,374
Did you see your resu'I-ts yet?

126
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:19,666


127
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,166
ND.

128
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:20,834


129
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:25,171
Don't worry. The gnddess of victory
will surely smile upon you.

130
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,673


131
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,383
Let's hook at the results then

132
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,134


133
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:29,676
Yes.

134
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,469


135
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,682
You're here for me when I needed
someone, Kazamatsuri-san.

136
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,349


137
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,267
What is your n u mlber?

138
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:37,517
u

139
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,438
Oh yea. SOS.

140
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,815


141
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,191
A great number.

142
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,736


143
00:08:47,736 --> 00:09:01,332


144
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:06,588
me? It's number sows, then?

145
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,134
Yes, it's a fairly lucky number,
so I think she's okay...

146
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:11,426


147
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,636
...but I haven't heard back from Yawara yet.

148
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:13,887


149
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,930
O... oh gosh.

150
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,765

00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,064
Thank you so much for your trouble.

00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,070
She studied so ham  She can't fail,

154
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,530
She's gotta be quah'fied. She just has to

155
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,368
But, if she passes, then what about judo?

156
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:41,039
I've never heard of a judo gold medallist
coming from a Z-year women's collage!

157
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,543
Darnirt... to heck with it all!

158
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,047

00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,094


161
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,720

162
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,934


163
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,561

00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,396

00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,442

00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:09,901
Yup.

168
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,110


169
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,199
Darnit, l was planning on sharing her

00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:16,408


171
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,993
Oh, what a predicament, momma!

172
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,038


173
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,666
I... Isn't this...?

174
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,543

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,212

Huh?

178
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,048
Good far you.

00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,582

No, no, not at all. Youxr happiness

00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,381


183
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,842
I should call my mom, because
she might be worried.

184
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,218


185
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:04,391
Oh yes, you shou'ld. Because of the traffic
jam, it took so long to get here.

186
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:04,933


187
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:05,558
Okay.

188
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,436


189
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,104

Let me go, Matsuda-san!


376
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,995
You've gotta cheat up a bit more, or you'm
get in trmub-le wi-th your Grandpa

377
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:46,287


378
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,416
Yeah" right. Another interview?

379
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,918
It's not an interview!

380
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:56,381
The reason I told you about Jody was
to inform you about your friend's...

381
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:56,548
There you go again.
TheI reason I told you about Jody was

382
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:57,549
There you go again.

383
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,676
l 'm not getting fooled by that anymore.

384
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,469


385
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:06,057
I was about to get faded and really fall for you.

386
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,854
Fall? What's that supposed to mean?

387
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,189


388
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,315
Nothing.

389
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,067


390
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:21,656
You must be disappointed that I qualified
for the Mitsuba College, Mavtsuda-san.

391
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,073


392
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,074
No!

393
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:27,620
Eh?

394
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,874
W... we'llw l't would have been great
if you had chosen Salllml College and
went to the Barcelona Olympics.

395
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:35,754
W." well, it would have been graazt
if you had chosen Sailkai College and
went to the Barcelona Olympics.

396
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:42,302
But, when I saw your number posted on
the Mitsuba College exam results...

397
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,179


398
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,016
I don't know but".

399
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:54,647
...l was glad that you passed.

400
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,028
Since it was the college you
really wanted to get into.

401
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,613


402
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:09,662
But, what are you going to do now? Now that
you're in Mitswba Women's College, what will
you do about the Barcelona Olympics?

403
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:16,461
What about your promise with Judy, who's
struggling through rehab just to fight you again?

404
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:21,049
I don't have to be in the Olympics to fight Jody.

405
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:29,516
You have to fight Jody at the Barcelona
Olympics, in front of the whole world!

406
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,726
And, I...

407
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,561


408
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,020


409
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,275
I... wan-t to... write a great article about it!

410
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:53,665


411
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,708
Why?

412
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,125


413
00:22:55,125 --> 00:23:06,094
So...

414
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,055
So.. I'm just...

415
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,181

00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:47,260


431
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,555
Sigh. One trouble after another.
