What are you doing to that little boy?

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,480
Oh, Inokuma.

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,010
Huh? Hanazono-kun?

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,650
Oh, let me introduce them.

44
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,240
That's my cousin, Toshihiko.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,660
He got injured a bit.

46
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,950
That's why Master's attending to him.

47
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,960
He can't even receive attacks correctly, 
yet he still played in a match.

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,210
A match?

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,550
These kids played in a match today.

50
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,100
I don't hold back for anything.

51
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,770
You got that right!

52
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,210
When it came to being utterly defeated, there was no holding back.

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,030
First player, Laiza Judo Club,
 Tanaka Kotaro-kun!

Osoto Gari Ippon!

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,480
Laiza Judo Club!

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,030
I should've tried a dry run.

71
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,490
We're still in it! Show some guts, Choro!

72
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,660
Easier said than done.

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,230
Hajime!

74
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,300
Come on. Why so serious?

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,710
Isn't this just a game?

76
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,590
Come on. Let's see you smile!

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,490
Say no to violence! Dismantle all nukes!

78
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,030
Save me, please!

79
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,030
Hey!

80
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,660
Hey, you!

81
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,310
Help!

82
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,120
Hey!

83
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,090
Enough!

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,900
L-Loss by a foul!

85
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,950
It's... It's not over!

86
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,330
We'll make a big comeback!

87
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,400
Let's go, Toshihiko!

88
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,530
I'm right here!

89
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,660
Hajime!

90
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,970
I-Ippon!

91
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,780
It's in the bag!

92
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,930
Give it up!

93
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,180
T-Toshihiko!

94
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,770
Laiza Judo Club Vice Captain,
 Takai Masaru-kun!

95
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,820
Ginnan Judo Association Vice Captain,
 Ishida Yujiro-kun!

96
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,600
Ishida-kun? Ishida Yujiro-kun?

97
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,390
Laiza Judo Club wins byâ€”

98
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,330
Hold on!

99
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,330
Three seconds.

100
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm ending this bout in three seconds!

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,220
Whatever. Just get over here now!

102
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,600
Ippon!

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,110
He got thrown in three seconds!

104
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,390
Laiza Judo Club, Sagara Junji-kun!

105
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,160
Ginnan Judo Association,
 Sotomura Mayumi-san!

106
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,540
Hajime!

107
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,050
Mayumi-chan, get at least one win for us!

108
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,310
Ippon!

109
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,780
Cheer up!

110
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,030
"Never give up."

111
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,750
The horror!

112
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,460
I'm utterly ashamed!

113
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,790
It's not so bad.

114
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,350
Life has its ups and downs.

115
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,600
Right?!

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,550
The way you guys never
 reflect on what you do

117
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,860
is completely despicable!

118
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,470
Why don't you think about
 how Mayumi-chan feels?

119
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,780
No matter how hard she tries,

120
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,480
it all comes to nothing
 because of your horseplay!

121
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,100
Mayumi lost today too!

122
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,980
I'll definitely win next time!

123
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,900
Yes, that's the spirit!

124
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,200
That's right, Inokuma!

125
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,810
Could you possibly coach them?

126
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,930
Numskull!

127
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,030
Yawara's concentrating
 on her own judo every day.

128
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,620
Her sights are set on the Barcelona Olympics!

129
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,460
She ain't got time for no snot-nosed kids!

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,250
It's Inokuma Yawara!

131
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,630
I knew I'd seen her somewhere!

132
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,890
You're way smaller than you look on TV.

133
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,220
I get it!

134
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,260
And you're that geezer!

135
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,690
Wow, I couldn't tell because you're wearing a white coat!

136
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,690
Who you calling a geezer, you little puke?!

137
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,780
Grandpa!

138
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,110
Ow...

139
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,190
You practically cracked
 my skull, you old fart!

140
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,500
You idiot!

141
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,410
You're supposed to call him "Master"!

142
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,580
Easter Island Mohawk.

143
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,580
What did you say, huh?!

144
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,500
You little...

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,500
Don't, Hanazono-kun!

146
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,930
He's still a little kid!

147
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,010
But...

148
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,340
Exercise some judgment.
 You're not a kid, you know!

149
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,010
He's right.

150
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,260
White.

151
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,120
White.

152
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,480
What are you doing?

153
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,050
Come back here!

154
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,050
White! White!

155
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,560
Over here!

156
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,540
White!

157
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,320
Move it, Hanazono-kun!

158
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,950
Now, now...

159
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,950
He's just a kid, you know.

160
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,170
We're leaving, guys!

161
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,690
Goodbye. Thanks for everything.

162
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,710
Hold on!

163
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,750
Hey, wait!

164
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,920
Wait!

165
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,520
Wait, Mayumi!

166
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,610
Wait for us!

167
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,610
Don't go off by yourself!

168
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,890
I wish Inokuma Yawara would coach me.

169
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,580
I'd have all the bragging rights.

170
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,730
What are you saying?

171
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,100
We need to do things for ourselves.

172
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,590
We'll get better if we practice on our own.

173
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,340
You think so?

174
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,090
You know we're totally weak.

175
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,100
"Resignation. Akirame."

176
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,050
Quit reading a book while you're walking.

177
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,490
Either read or walk. You're bugging me!

178
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,520
Do what you want.

179
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,810
Anyway, all we need is more effort.

180
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,700
We have another match 
coming up in a month.

181
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,190
It's our last match as grade schoolers!

182
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,710
This time, Junji...

183
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,250
We'll hand Laiza their butts!

184
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,990
Her father is a police officer.

185
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,730
Every Sunday, he taught judo to kids
 under a ginkgo tree at Kumano Shrine.

186
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,260
But he's been hospitalized for a year with an ailment.

187
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,450
Hospitalized?

188
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,210
The kids have been dropping out one by one.

189
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,270
The only ones left are those five.

190
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,860
Mayumi-chan... is doing the best she can
 with what she has right now.

191
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,690
The Honami Group is an
 Earth-friendly corporation.

192
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,670
Oh, give me a break!

193
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,390
Who the hell do you think cuts down
 all the trees and releases all the fumes?

194
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,240
This is the Honami hour program, 24 HR.

195
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,160
We continue with our segment dedicated to heralding a wonderful new century.

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,060
Indeed!

197
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,910
Sayaka-san! Honami Sayaka-san,
 can you hear us?!

198
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,910
Honami Sayaka

199
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,620
Good people of Japan,
 this is Honami Sayaka.

200
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm sure you were all waiting impatiently for my appearance.

201
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,420
Speak for yourself.

202
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:42,430
This is the Laiza Judo Club, which is 
charitably funded by the Honami Group.

203
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,650
Take a look at the luxurious lobby.

204
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,430
Don't you just love the atrium ceiling?

205
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,280
This marvelous judo facility

206
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,940
was established to train the minds and bodies of the children who will inherit

207
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,400
the 21st century.

208
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,150
This is the training room.

209
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,210
We've assembled the most cutting-edge exercise machines.

210
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,370
Allow me to try one for a bit.

211
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,880
This is good TV.

212
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,200
As you can see, as long as the children are trained in this magnificent environment,

213
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,390
it is quite possible that we will see a second or third Honami Sayaka.

214
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
What wonderful philanthropy!

215
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
What spirit of volunteerism!

216
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,510
The Laiza Judo Club will realize its global ambition going into the 21st century,

217
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,590
connecting the whole world through judo!

218
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,820
Judo will save the entire world!

219
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,730
If judo can save the world, then I've saved the world hundreds of times!

220
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,610
So do you like it?

221
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,400
Uh? Oh, it's delicious.

222
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,830
This is some darn good fried rice.

223
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,770
It's not fried rice! It's paella!

224
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,950
It's Spanish cuisine!

225
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,500
I spent three hours on it.

226
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,660
Paella, malaria, whatever.

227
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,930
If you have that much time to cook,
 why not put some of it toward practice?




228
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,140
Man alive, you've been wasting your time on all sorts of nonsense.

229
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,940
I see. So you don't want it.

230
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,450
Hey, hold it right there!

231
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,550
I'm still eating.


232
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,650
You seem to like complaining
 better than eating.

233
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,160
No, this "piranha" is actually pretty good!

234
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,080
You're not getting any!

235
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,850
Hey, wait! Don't get peeved!

236
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,520
Hey, how'd you like this?

237
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,620
Ow! Ow! Ow!

238
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,620
I have you now!

239
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,350
So do you give up?

240
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,350
No!

241
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,290
Say "Uncle"!

242
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,940
Ow, let me go!

243
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,300
Ow!

244
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,300
Come on, come on!

245
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,700
Come on. Hey, ow, ow!

246
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,760
Ouch!

247
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,510
Come on. Give up!

248
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,600
Here we go!

249
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,020
Come on. That's gotta hurt!

250
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,560
No, it doesn't!

251
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,840
Hey, wait!

252
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,750
I'll get you back!

253
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,980
Come on. Quit crying, you wuss!

254
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,650
Hey, crybaby!

255
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,330
Cut that out!

256
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,080
The match is coming up in a month!

257
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,290
Do you think we can win
 against Laiza like this?

258
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,880
There's no use practicing.

259
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,290
We're too weak.

260
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,470
That's it!

261
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,670
Do what you want!

262
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,720
Geez, what's got her panties in a knot?

263
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,820
I have to go to cram school.

264
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,900
Oh, I have to deliver some food.

265
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,540
What? Hurry up and get going!

266
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,800
Here, thanks again!

267
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,260
Let's go, Mayumi-chan!

268
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,780
Come on. Let's fight!

269
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,320
All right!

270
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,850
Ippon! Sore made!

271
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,230
All right! I did it!

272
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,110
Mayumi

273
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,730
Mayumi

274
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,480
Mayumi

275
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,740
Mayumi

276
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,740
Today's winner is Mayumi!

277
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,720
You can do it, Junji!

278
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,210
Junji, I'm going to win
 the title this year too.

279
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,720
Not on my watch!

280
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,630
Ippon! Junji's the champion!

281
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,730
Mayumi

282
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,730
Mayumi

283
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,730
Mayumi

284
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,730
Junji

285
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,730
Junji

286
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Mayumi

287
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Mayumi

288
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Mayumi

289
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Mayumi

290
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Junji

291
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Junji

292
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Junji

293
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,260
Junji quit?

294
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,150
You're kidding, right?

295
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,920
Laiza recruited him.

296
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,270
They're letting him train for free.

297
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,110
He must have been psyched.

298
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,700
They have top-of-the-line training equipment.

299
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,160
Mayumi

300
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,040
Mayumi

301
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,040
Mayumi

302
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,160
Junji

303
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,040
Junji

304
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,660
Junji

305
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Mayumi

306
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,160
Mayumi

307
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
Mayumi

308
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
Mayumi

309
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
Mayumi

310
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
Mayumi

311
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
Junji

312
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
Junji

313
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,290
Junji

314
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,330
Junji!

315
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,300
'Sup.

316
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,800
Why are you here? You don't belong here anymore!

317
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,810
Just taking a shortcut.

318
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,230
Don't just come waltzing in!

319
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,810
You went to Laiza just because Dad's in the hospital. You traitor.

320
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,480
That's not what happened!

321
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,320
Then why?!


322
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,070
I had my reasons.

323
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,870
It's all right. You must be happy now that you're getting better. Good for you.

324
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,530
Don't wise off.


325
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,020
Just so you know, you only won because I was off my game.

326
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,670
If I fought you for realâ€”

327
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,590
You'd just end up losing again!

328
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,980
Then let's get it on right here.

329
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,590
Like I'm going to fight some crazy girl.

330
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,470
Say that again.


331
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,090
What the heck?

332
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,100
Kumano Shrine

333
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,110
How dare you say that?
 Let's fight right now.

334
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,970
Come on. Cut the crap!

335
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,100
You're just afraid of losing!

336
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,600
No, I'm not!

337
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,560
I'm glad a guy like you has left Ginnan.

338
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,580
Heh, you're still a little girl!

339
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,080
Wh-Why are you wearing a bra?

340
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,210
You don't even have boobs!

341
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,710
Fugly!

342
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,620
Retard!

343
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,770
Son of a bitch!

344
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,220
He'll pay for that!

345
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,320
I'll throw him flat on his back!

346
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,730
Hey, tuck in your lower arm!

347
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,730
Do it again, this time with your arms tucked in and your hips lowered.

348
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,000
Try it now.

349
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,240
That's a big improvement.

350
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,170
Itsuro, you need to eat your carrots.

351
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,100
Carrots contain 1.2 grams of protein,

352
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
39 mg of calcium,

353
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,450
400 mg of potassium,

354
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,880
and 0.07 mg of vitamin B1 in every 100-gram serving.

355
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,600
Yes, Mother.

356
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,180
Your grandfather is an economist. Your father is a diplomat.

357
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,680
Your brother is a doctor.
 Your sister is an attorney.

358
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,210
Each of them holds an important position.

359
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,620
So you will not put us to shame as a member of the Umemoto family.

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,620
Yes, Mother.

361
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,090
Also, I don't mind you practicing judo,

362
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,870
but remember that it is only to build up your strength for studying.

363
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,130
You mustn't become too absorbed in it.

364
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,450
Yes, Mother.

365
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,060
It's all over. There's nothing left.

366
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,070
Yes. It's all over.

367
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,990
Oranges

368
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,990
All we can do is to pick
 the right time to skip town.

369
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,120
I can't believe your company
 would go bankrupt.

370
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,380
Oranges

371
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,380
Yes. We also had to take on
 your parents' debts.

372
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,380
Add to that your visits to the racetracks.

373
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,140
Oranges

374
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,140
Yes, and in addition,
 someone stole our car yesterday.

375
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,650
And the fact that your father suffers from twisted bowels.

376
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,150
Oranges

377
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,150
Yes, and two days ago,
a dog bit me.

378
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,400
And...

379
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,400
God! Will you cut that out!

380
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,390
Why are you all so gloomy?

381
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,420
Life has its ups and downs.

382
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,410
I'm sure some good news
 will come along!

383
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,220
Look, Yujiro, you need 
to keep this in mind.

384
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,650
Everyone eventually hits
 a wall they can't scale.

385
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,920
Those who fall after hitting a bump in the road can never get back up.

386
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,580
There goes the mirror.

387
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,930
Such bad luck.

388
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,410
This is stupid!


389
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,300
The tea stem...

390
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,190
The tea stem...

391
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,070
fell over.

392
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,570
That's it for today's practice.

393
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,620
Thank you very much!

394
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,290
Now then, time to eat.

395
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,240
Ow!

396
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,220
Geez, Grandpa is taking practice
 way too seriously.

397
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,700
You're pretty scratched up, aren't you?

398
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,230
You must practice a lot.

399
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,370
That's right.

400
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,230
They're exposed when I wear short sleeves.

401
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,610
It's nothing to be embarrassed about!

402
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,740
It's proof that you're working hard.

403
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,740
You believe that?

404
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,520
That's so awesome.

405
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,630
Your famous grandfather trained you specially ever since you were a kid.

406
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,880
It must be an ideal environment.

407
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,980
You think so?

408
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,260
My father is teaching me judo too,

409
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,760
but he's in the hospital now.

410
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,410
Still, I want to win and make him happy.

411
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,760
Is that so?

412
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,020
I really love to do judo.

413
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,800
Everyone else likes judo too,

414
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,570
but they believe they can't win,
 no matter how hard they try,

415
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,030
so they fool around.

416
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,940
All they lack is confidence!

417
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,830
Yawara!

418
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,750
You getting out or what?
 Your skin'll get wrinkled!

419
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,160
How is this an "ideal environment"?

420
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,180
Gawanishi Hospital

421
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,180
I see. So you lost?

422
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,380
Yeah.

423
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,970
But don't worry. I'll win
 the next competition.

424
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,660
Also, I had a good run in the match I lost.

425
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,070
Everybody is practicing their hearts out.

426
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,780
I see. That's good.

427
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,870
You won't be playing against boys anymore after you enter middle school.

428
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,290
In a way, this will be your last match.

429
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,290
Yes. My last match.

430
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,030
You can do it.

431
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,900
Yeah.

432
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,810
Hey, are you sure it's okay
 not to go to practice?

433
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,630
Are you stupid?

434
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,100
Who the hell does judo 
during summer break?

435
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,810
Hey, Itsuro, what about cram school?

436
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,150
Grade 6 Math Aptitude Test

437
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,150

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,040
You're even dumber than me!

441
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,220
After I wrote my name,
 my mind went blank.

442
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,360
When I snapped out of it,
 time was already up.

443
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,950
Did you pull an all-nighter?

444
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,770
No. I take care of my health.

445
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,350
It must be the pressure.

446
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,990
Hey, look!

447
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,950
What is it?

448
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,430
It's Laiza!

449
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,280
Th-They're coming over.

450
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,990
Stay cool.

451
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,270
Yo.





452
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,950
Who'd've thought we'd find you wusses here playing arcade games?

453
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,210
They're still wearing their geeky clothes!

454
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,330
You look like a bunch of losers.

455
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,410
I heard your daddy's company failed.

456
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,840
If he wants, we can give him a job scrubbing our company's toilets.

457
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,470
What?!

458
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:17,840
Don't!



459
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,460
Your family runs a ramen shop, right?

460
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,700
I heard that place makes
 the broth out of dead cats.

461
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,600
Let's bounce.

462
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,230
Yeah.

463
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,890
"The principle of nonresistance."

464
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,430

469
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,020
Welcome...

470
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,440
Oh, it's just you.

471
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,360
Can I help with the deliveries?

472
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,460
Oh, that's rare.

473
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,870
Take that box to Tanaka-san
 on Third Street.

474
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,480
Say, Dad,

475
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,380
our ramen is delicious, isn't it?

476
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,080
Got that right!

477
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,420
The soup I prepare every day at two in the morning is one of a kind!

478
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,250
Come on. Quit standing around and go.

479
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,390
The noodles will get soggy.

480
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,270
Okay!

481
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,240
Say, are we wusses?

482
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,300
Are we that geeky?

483
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,590
Do we look like losers?

484
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,040
This blows.

Oh, hey!

489
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,560
Wait up!

490
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,540
Doing deliveries? I'm impressed!

491
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,820
That cool bike is getting a workout.

492
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,780
Hurry up! Here, lemme give you a push!

493
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,890
Man, that's lame!

494
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,290
Got me laughing!

495
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,760
Get your ass outta here!

496
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,300
How'd ya like that cat soup ramen?

497
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,550
You dickweeds!

498
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,440
I wonder what Mayumi-chan is doing?

499
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,440
Wanna go?

500
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,890
Sure!

501
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,940
Choro!

502
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,950
You all right, Choro?

503
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,150
D-Dammit!

504
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,500
Our ramen is great,

505
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,460
but those bastards talked trash about it.

506
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,460
Choro!

507
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,130
Oh, my God! How could they do this?

508
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,390
D-Dammit. Those Laiza bastards
 pulled a punk move!

509
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,530
Four against one isn't fair!

510
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,140
It's not fair!

511
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,570
Our ramen...

512
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,650
is delicious!

513
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,070
Dammit! I'm going to pulverize those punks!

514
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,700
I'll make them say "sorry"
 for saying we look like losers!

515
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,950
I'll make them take back the word "geeky"!

516
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,460
I'll make them say our ramen is delicious!

517
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,720
That's right!

518
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,260
That's the spirit! We'll be strong if we all work hard!

519
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,870
Don't you agree, Yawara-san?

520
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,010
All right. Let's do it!

521
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,760
Let's get strong enough
 to kick Laiza's butt!

522
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,610
Yeah!

523
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,570
Come on. Pick up the pace!

524
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,760
I'm hungry!

525
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,570
Wait!

526
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,050
I'm done!

I'm home.

00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,940
Idiot! Where did you wander
 off to at this hour?

531
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,060
Judo...

532
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,280
Blockhead!

533
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,940
How long are you gonna
 abuse yourself like that?!

534
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,690
A shrimp like you ain't gonna win anyway!

535
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,370
Oh my!

00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,160
Toshihiko-chan!

537
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,310
Y-You're seriously injured!

538
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,670
Honey, honey, this is bad!

539
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Toshihiko-chan is seriously...

540
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,700
Toshihiko-chan, please quit judo.
 It's so barbaric!

541
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,940
I was against it from the start.

542
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,770
Let him be.

543
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,940
Toshihiko wants to become a man.

544
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,630
Wh-What are you saying, honey?

545
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,940
How could you be so irresponsible?

546
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,770
What if the unthinkable happens to him?

547
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,760
Yes, this is the Izawa residence.

548
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,080

concerned about Itsuro.

552
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,090
Grade 6 Math Aptitude Test

553
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,090
Umemoto Itsuro

554
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,590
Do you have any idea what's going on?

555
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,060
I knew it.

556
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,620
I'm worried about my son too.

557
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,350
This has gotten out of hand. 
What should we do?

558
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,740
Yes. Yes, indeed.

559
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,640
No! Lower your hips and use the recoil!

560
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,080
Okay!

561
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,500
Yawara-san is coaching them?

562
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,110
Yeah.

563
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,460
She's taking a bunch of weak little chicks

564
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,510
under her wings so they can take on some big shots called Laiza.

565
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,490
L-Laiza?

566
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:21,390
Do you mean the Laiza, the place that's funded and managed by the Honami Group?

567
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,670
I can hear that heiress grinding her teeth right now. Your move.

568
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
Check!

569
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,630
I get it!

570
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,200
So this is a proxy battle between
 Inokuma Yawara and Honami Sayaka?

571
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,850
That's juicy!

572
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,820
I'm going to go cover it!

573
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,240
Hey! You running away, Matsuda?

574
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,790
Hey!

575
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,800
Get it together, guys! Keep at it!

576
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,370
I'm tired!

577
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,780
I'm dying. I'm dying.

578
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,520
Water...

579
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,770
What are you saying? The match is coming up in two weeks!

580
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,750
She's right.

581
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,310
You can't lose heart now!

582
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,390
Aren't you pissed that they always make fun of you?

583
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,190
You want to beat the crap 
out of them, don't you?

584
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,200
Th-That's what we wanted to do.

585
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,200
But this is too hard.

586
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,160
I'm dying. I'm dying.

587
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,400
Man, oh man.

588
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,960
These chicks haven't even
 come out of their shells.

589
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,210
Matsuda-san!

590
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,380
They can say our ramen
 tastes like garbage.

591
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,670
I'm putting my studies first.

592
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,300
Mama's worried anyway.

593
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Guess we should just skip town.

594
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,600
God!

595
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,680
Hey!

596
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,770
Enough of that nonsense!
 You're all men, aren't you?

597
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,770
Hey, why don't we train at my place?

598
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,720
Really?

599
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,770
Can we?

600
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,430
Sure.

601
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,070
That way, you can concentrate on practice.

602
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,080
I'm dying! I'm dying!

603
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,620
They aren't coming.

604
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,130
Maybe I pushed them too hard.

605
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,110
They... all gave up.

606
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,290
Hey, why don't the two of us practice?

607
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,160
Okay.

608
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,300
Hi there!

609
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,440
It's Rai Rai Ken!

610
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,950
I'm here with your order!

611
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,530
Choro!

612
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,020
Good evening.

613
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,480
I've already done two weeks'
 worth of homework.

614
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,770
I can't stand to see a girl cry.

615
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,510
Guys!

616
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,410
Okay! Five more laps!

617
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,520
I thought they'd turned tail and run.

618
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,450
These kids might actually have a chance.

619
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,690
Toshihiko-chan!

620
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,240
Itsuro!

621
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,380
Mother!

622
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,240
Mama!

623
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,320
Who are you people?

624
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,830
That's none of your business!

625
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,250
Hey! Chorosuke!

626
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,200
Dad!

627
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Yujiro, don't fight fate.

628
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,400
Toshihiko-chan, you shouldn't be doing judo!

629
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,400
You can't afford to play practice here!

630
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,390
Idiot!

631
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,940
You don't even help around the shop!

632
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,890
I thought something was going on.

633
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,300
Is this how you treat your old man?!

634
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,300
So this is what you were doing?

635
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
We're leaving!

636
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,700
They're making fun of our ramen!

637
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,520
Aren't you angry, Dad?!

638
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,270
Don't let their words get to you!

639
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,520
If you don't graduate, what will you do?

640
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,970
Come on, you need to go to cram school.

641
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,140
Let's go home, Toshihiko-chan!

642
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,800
Come on!

643
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,620
Itsuro!

644
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,160
Toshihiko-chan!

645
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,160
Come on!

646
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,320
I'm not going!

647
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,830
Help out our shop!

648
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,750
I'm going to practice!

649
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,620
Enough of your nonsense!

650
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,620
Yujiro...

651
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,170
No way!

652
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,750
I'm staying!

653
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,600
Me too!

654
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,510
Me too!

655
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,180
Hey, this is your old man talking here!

656
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,630
Oh, my!

657
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,250
Yujiro...

658
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,010
I can't believe you'd say that!

659
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,920
C'mon, we're going home!

660
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,450
Please.

661
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,990
They'll be playing a match soon, and they're working very hard!

662
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,520
Please let them stay!

663
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,620
So it's you?

664
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,480
You're the one who lured
 these children here?

665
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,180
Toshihiko-chan was never this rebellious!

666
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,700
What's the harm?
 Toshihiko is trying to be a man.

667
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,530
You keep quiet!

668
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,030
Good!

669
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,660
Grandpa!

670
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,010
These parents have truly
 expressed their feelings.

671
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,790
I am deeply moved!

672
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,670
In the spring of my nineteenth year, I left my home in Yamagata with high ambitions.

673
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:09,960
My parents were so heartbroken over letting go of their son that they wept pearly tears.

674
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,680
And you kids!

675
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,690
You're barely out of diapers, and you still have that blue spot on your butts!

676
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,030
Of course your parents are worried!

677
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,380
They'd certainly fuss 
over their little nestlings.

678
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,260
Y-Yes, you're completely right.

679
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,320
All righty.

680
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,550
I'll let you fine people stay here
 and train as well.

681
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,760
If you devote yourselves to judo along with your children,

682
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,580
you'll get rid of that flab on your bellies.

683
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,870
Are you nuts?

684
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,580
That's not the issue here!

685
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,260
If you don't like it, then beat it!

686
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,380
This is a sacred dojo!

687
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,590
If you ain't here for judo,
 you ain't welcome!

688
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,300

751
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,020
Such a tedious article!

752
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,920
They will always be a third-rate newspaper.

753
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:47,350
Laiza would never lose to an indigent club led by that girl.

754
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,770
Isn't that correct, Coach?

755
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,300
There's no need to worry.

756
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,530
There's no possible way
 we could lose to them.

757
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,700
Of course not.

758
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,290
We do have an understanding, correct?

759
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,380
If the unthinkable happens...

760
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:13,130
I-If the unthinkable happens?

761
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,880
This will be your fate.

762
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,090
I'll be getting the ax?

763
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,490
Woo-hoo!

00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,250
Just one day left.

765
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,600
Yeah, our destined match.

766
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,130
Have we really gotten better?

767
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,320
Can we win?

768
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,150
Don't worry. Believe in yourselves.

769
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,850
You guys have improved, 
way more than you think.

770

We will now begin the match between the Laiza Judo Club and the Ginnan Judo Association!

771
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,410
You're still gonna lose.

772
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,850
Don't blame us if you
 run home crying again.

773
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,700
You guys will eat those words.

774
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,690
We better not see you guys cry.

775
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,860
You're not going to beat me, Junji.

776
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,480
Bow!

777
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,410
Fight out there, Ginnan!

782
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,940
Itsuro-kun, do it when the right foot
 touches the mat.

783
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,250
Don't worry. You'll do well.

784
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,770
Bow!

785
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,700
When the right foot touches the mat...

786
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,700
Let's go, Itsuro!

787
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,880
Leave him for dead!

788
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,100
This will be a piece of cake.

789
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,690
Throw him down with just your pinkie!

790
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:36,690
Hajime!

791
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,600
"When your opponent's
 right foot touches the mat,

792
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,450
push with your right hand
 toward the back,

793
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,040
and pull with your left hand
 directly downwards!"

794
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,000
"When your opponent's
 right foot touches the mat..."

795
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,840
Waza Ari!

796
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,280
All right!

797
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,560
That was awesome, Itsuro!

798
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,010
Go get him!

799
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,360
Keep it up!

800
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,160
Wh-What are you doing with him?!

801
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,140
Hajime!

802
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:15,940
Waza Ari!

803
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,440
Get out of there!

804
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,910
Osaekomi!

805
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,560
Good going, Itsuro!

806
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,840
You can do it!

807
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,010
How awful!

808
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:42,630
This is bad.

809
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,610
Keep going, Itsuro!

810
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,110
You're almost out of bounds!

811
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,850
Ippon!

812
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,050
Sore made!

813
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,860
He had me scared.

814
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,560
Itsuro-kun, are you okay?

815
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,320
You did well, Itsuro.

816
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,620
I-I'm pissed!

817
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,330
This is worse than getting
 a zero on a test!

818
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,830
Itsuro.

819
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,130
Laiza Judo Club, Suzuki-kun!

820
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,130
Ginnan Judo Association, Izawa-kun!

821
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,130
All right!

822
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,140
Show 'em you got guts, Toshihiko!

823
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,800
Listen, aim for a Newaza.

824
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,780
Don't worry! We've been practicing a lot, so be confident!

825
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,410
Hajime!

826
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,270
Get him!

827
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,370
Toshihiko!

828
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,260
Now's your chance! Pin him!

829
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,830
Osaekomi!

830
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,370
He's got it!

831
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,770
Way to go, Toshihiko!

832
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,770
Y-You dummy! Get away! Shake him!

833
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,490
Stop this, Toshihiko-chan!
 Come home with Mama!

834
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,120
Why not let him be?
 He's trying to become a man.

835
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,500
What was that?!

836
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,340
Because of you, Toshihiko-chan is suffering right now!

837
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,500
Break it up!

838
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,290
Jigoro-san!

839
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,500
Master!

840
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:47,820
That chicken down there is looking to fly high in the sky.

841
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,510
Why don't you both try these,
 shut up, and watch?!

842
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,100
A chicken?

843
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,510
Fly in the sky?

844
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,080
Toshihiko...

845
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,560
Please, stop this, Toshihiko!

846
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,560
Don't let go, Toshihiko!

847
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,570
You can do it, Toshihiko!

848
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,570
Stop, Toshihiko-chan!

849
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,570
Stop!

850
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,570
Don't let go!

851
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,080
Ippon! Sore made!

852
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,620
All right!

853
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,580
1-1!

854
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,890
He flew!

855
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,900
We're tied!

856
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,590
Toshihiko-chan!

857
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,610
Laiza Judo Club, Wakamatsu-kun!

858
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,130

859
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,950
We're counting on you, Choro!

860
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,100
I got this!

861
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:43,980
Hajime!

862
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,980
I'm getting you back for my ramen!

863
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,610
Get him!

864
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,360
You can do it!

865
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,110
Choro!

866
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,140
Make it happen!

867
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:56,780
Now!

868
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,790
Yuko!

869
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,000
All right!

870
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,290
Way to go, Choro!

871
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,790
My boy ain't doing half bad!

872
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,170
What're you doing, you idiot?!

873
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,790
Do what I just told you!

874
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,810
Waza Ari!

875
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,600
That dirty rat!

876
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,810
Isn't that a foul?

877
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,440
That might've been foul play.

878
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,540
And it might've been a fluke.

879
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,320
What?

880
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:37,230
Get him, Choro! You can do it!

881
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,990
You can do it!

882
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,320
Get him, Choro!

883
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,320
Go, Choro!

884
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,950
Throw that punk on his ass!

885
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,620
Go!

886
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,450
Hold on, Choro!

887
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,510
Resist!

888
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,930
That shrimp is really hanging in there.

889
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,260
You can say that again!

890
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,240
That's my son down there.

891
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,500
That boy's gonna show us
 how good he really is!

892
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,550
Oh, that's a shame.

893
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,810
I really wanted to see that.

894
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,690
What?

895
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:16,990
Sore made!

896
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,730
Laiza Judo Club, Wakamatsu-kun!

897
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,650
Wh-What the hell's with him?!

898
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,970
My boy was about to counterattack!

899
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,880
Overtime! I want overtime!

900
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,510
Now, now, Shiraoka-san. 
The wall was too thick.

901
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:35,440
Bow!

902
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,650
I have to say, your son
 really hung in there!

903
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,510
Of course he did!

904
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,020
My son and my ramen 
are the best there is!

905
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,200
Dammit!

906
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,020
You did well, Choro-kun.

907
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,650
Yeah! Yujiro and I will avenge you!

908
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,820
Yujiro?

909
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,730
Yujiro-kun!

910
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,530
Is Ishida Yujiro-kun here?

911
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,530
Yujiro-kun!

912
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,030
That moron.

Ippon!

916
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,550
I'm winning this match with an Ippon!

917
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,520
That fool only learned one move.

918
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,020
Calm down! Watch your opponent closely!

919
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,490
Waza Ari!

920
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,490
Turtle up! Turtle up!

921
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,120
Turtle?

922
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:45,490
Osaekomi!

923
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,460
That's what he gets for acting cocky.

924
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,200
It's in the bag!

925
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,960
There's no way he's getting out of Takai's Osaekomi!

926
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,970
There's the wall. Give it up, Yujiro.

927
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,630
Shut up!

928
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,470
I'm not giving up!

929
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,470
You're up against the wall.

930
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,730
Screw your wall!

931
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,230
It's still the wall.

932
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,230
Screw your wall!

933
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:15,730
That's the wall.

934
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:21,240
Screw... your... wall!

935
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,740
Mate!

936
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,250
All right!

937
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,370
Honey...

938
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,600
He... broke down the wall.

939
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,750
I-Impossible.

940
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,170
Hajime!

941
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,220
End it already, you moron!

942
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,770
Ippon!

943
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,690
All right!

944
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,730
2-2!

945
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:05,010
He did pretty good!

946
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,070
Good job!

947
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,080
The worm has truly turned indeed.

948
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,970
Laiza Judo Club, Sagara-kun!

949
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:20,130
Ginnan Judo Association, Sotomura-san!

950
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,090
You can do it, Mayumi!

951
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,990
Do you understand, Junji?

952
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,970
I believe in you the most!

953
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,510
Don't forget what Laiza has done for you!

954
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,440
Don't worry. I know you'll win!

955
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,340
Don't forget the timing from practice!

956
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,180
Bow!

957
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,990
Hajime!

958
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,620
Fight him!

959
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,290
You can do it!

960
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,300
Jougai!

961
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,300
I'd say they're evenly matched.

962
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:12,790
You can do it!

963
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,230
Go, go, Mayumi!

964
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,690
Junji! Junji! Junji!

965
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,690
Waza Ari!

966
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,820
Good!

967
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,290
Only thirty seconds left.

968
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,490
That's enough, Junji!
 Don't engage her!

969
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,920
Junji, you rat prick!

970
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,300
Fight her, dammit!

971
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,120
That's all she wrote.

972
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,300
He ain't gonna let her grab him.

973
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,850
That's good! Just think about winning!

974
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,650
That's low!

975
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,860
Dammit! A man's supposed to fight!

976
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,360
Fifteen seconds left!

977
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,070
Ten seconds!

978
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,570
Mayumi...</i>

979
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,430
Junji! Let's fight!

980
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,850
Let's fight, Junji!

981
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,840
Come on! Fight me, fight me!

982
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,260
I-Impossible!

983
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,070
Now!

984
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,390
Ippon! Sore made!

985
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,420
All right!

986
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,380
I'm so moved!

987
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,470
This will be your fate.

988
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,470
I'm fired?!

989
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,920
Itsuro!

990
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,540
Come on, let's go.

991
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,100
It's time for cram school.

992
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,360
You too, Toshihiko-chan.

993
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,430
I don't want to see you
 in any more danger.

994
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,830
Come on, let's go!

995
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,400
We're awesome!

996
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,480
Yay!

997
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,980
All right!

998
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,490
Yeah!
