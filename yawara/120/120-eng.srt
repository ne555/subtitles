1
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,660
Inokuma-san! Can we have just one comment?

2
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,080
You're about to take on your own father! How determined are you?

3
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,050
Are you really going to throw your father's pupil, Miss Honami?!

4
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,090
Inokuma-san!



5
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,130
Hey, we're in the middle of training!

6
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,640
Can't you give us something?

7
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,260
Stop bothering us!

8
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,680
W-Wait!

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,390
Inokuma-san, just one comment!

10
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,600
We're begging you!

11
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,810
Wait!

12
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,270
Wait for us!

13
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,700
Yeah! Why don't you try catching up with us first?

14
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,490
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san. They're interrupting our training because of me.


15
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,500
No, don't say that. You're the one who's suffering.

16
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,550
My mom told me something.

17
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,210
Huh?

18
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,170
She said I need to give it my all.

19
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,170
Because if I don't, my dad won't return home.

20
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,170
Yeah.

21
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,180
Let's do our best!

22
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:48,180
The Comeback Ippon Zeoi!

23
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,020
Next!

24
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,440
Who's next in line?

25
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,440
Isn't there anyone here who is stronger?

26
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,410
I'm dying.

27
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,460
S-Sayaka-san is overly driven.

28
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,540
My body can't take it!

29
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,870
Th-This time... This time Sayaka-san is actually going to beat Yawara-san!

30
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,180
If Sayaka-san does defeat Yawara-san...

31
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,180
I-I'm marrying her!

32
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,310
What now?

33
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,480
If that happens, I'll no longer be a free man.

34
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,190
I have to do something... anything!

35
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,270
I know!


36
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,700
If I undermine the performance of Honami Travel, it'll take our marriage off the table.

37
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Gah! I can't undermine the stock of my own company!

38
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,620
How about this?

39
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,660
What if I pretend I got lost in the Amazon jungle during a tour?

40
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,420
But I'll lose everything if I actually get eaten by an alligator!

41
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,960
I-I know!




42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,420
What if I get an astrologist to tell her to
 postpone the wedding due to bad portents?

43
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,630
It won't work!

44
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,930
Sayaka-san will just use her frightening strength and toss any bad portents to Timbuktu!

45
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,870
It's no use! It's hopeless!

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,730
Stop it.

47
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,020
That's it.

48
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,990
I need to give up this roundabout way of thinking.

49
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,820
Yes! Who cares about status, prestige, or money?



50
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,950
Forsake all those things, Shinnosuke! You need to remain free and happy!

51
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,830
Also, live for the pure love you have for Yawara-san!

52
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,580
Arise, Shinnosuke! Stand up proud!

53
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,710
This is for true love!


54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,970
So this is where you've been resting, Kazamatsuri-san?

55
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,470
Come, it's time to train!

56
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,610
Jody!

57
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah. We just learned that Jody won the North American Championships.

58
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,740
I thought you should be the first to know.

59
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,660
Jody's Olympic berth is now all but sewn up.

60
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,740
Really?



61
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,290
I'm happy for you, Jody!

62
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,160
It's almost time for you too.

63
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,710
People might have been pestering you about the thing with your dad.



64
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,720
But it's still important to keep your promise to Jody that you'll fight her in a major tournament!

65
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,220
You got it!

66
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,600
Thank God you're cheerful!

67
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,230
I didn't know what I'd do if you were tormented about this!

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,980
Hey, Yawara!

69
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,230
How long you gonna goldbrick?

70
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,990
Get back to training, willya?

71
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,400
Right!


72
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,860
I'll see you later, Matsuda-san!

73
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,950
Yawara-san!

74
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,660
Yes?

75
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,410
Go get 'em!

76
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,540
Of course!

77
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,000
More...

78
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,930
More practice!

79
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,520
W-We did more than enough.
 Let's stop here, Sayaka-san!

80
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,400
T-Tomorrow is the big tournament!

81
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,320
No, we're still not done!

82
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,860
I will thoroughly grind that Inokuma Yawara into the ground

83
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,280
and drive the final nail through her coffin!

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,820
So I need to put the finishing touches on...

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,460
You'll win.</i>

86
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,840
This time, you will defeat Yawara-san.</i>

87
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,680
Once you've settled your long-standing grudge against her,</i>

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,470
you'll next shift your focus toward our grand wedding.</i>

89
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,980
However, I won't be there when that happens.</i>

90
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,230
I've made my decision.</i>

91
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll abandon everything and live for my love for Yawara-san.</i>

92
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,450
Your victory tomorrow will spell the end of our relationship.</i>

93
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,790
Kojiro-san!


94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,830
She has now completed my training.

95
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,790
I've taught her everything I know.

96
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,340
Indeed.

97
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,300
Sayaka-san will definitely win, won't she?

98
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,340
She's achieved the 99 percent that is effort.

99
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,600
The remaining one percent comes tomorrow: whether or not she has the luck.

100
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,520
Kojiro-san.


101
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,440
Let me ask you one thing.

102
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,320
Why are you going this far to defeat Yawara-san, your very own daughter?

103
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,530
Take a bath and rest up for today.

104
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,290
Here. I've fixed the seams.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,290
Thank you, Mom.


106
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,590
Are you taking lunch with you tomorrow? What do you want for a side dish?


107
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,300
I'll probably be too nervous to eat.

108
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,760
That won't do!


109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,680
You need eat and build up your strength, like your grandfather does!

110
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,270
I know. Why don't I make cutlets so that you'll win?

111
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,270
Notes: "Katsu" means both "pork cutlets" and "win."#

112
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,270
But then again, your father might be eating cutlets too.

113
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,990
In that case, I need to make better cutlets than the ones he'll be eating.

114
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,280
Mom, I...

115
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,280
Yawara.



116
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,750
Keep it together!

117
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,250
Okay.

118
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,270
I-It's hopeless. I'll lose in the first round!</i>

119
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,270
I've caused so many problems for everyone, but I'll still lose my first match!</i>

120
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,740
Fight them, Fujiko-san!

121
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Fight them...

122
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,750
That's right, I must fight.</i>

123
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,750
Fuku-chan, watch me.</i>

124
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,130
Your mother is going to give it her all.</i>


125
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,140
Daddy!

126
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,770
Daddy!

127
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,390
Daddy!

128
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,160
Dad...

She's here!

131
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,730
Honami Sayaka has arrived!

132
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,570
Miss Honami!

133
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,440
Do you have any strategies for your matches today?


134
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,070
If you win this tournament,
 you'll finally make it to the Olympics.


135
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,620
I am not going to say much.

136
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,290
All Ippon wins. That is what I have to say!

137
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:07,890
All right! Make short work of this, so we can get those tickets to Barcelona!

We, the athletes, vow to engage in all our matches openly and fairly!

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,250
Representing the athletes, Honami Sayaka!

148
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,040
Listen to that crowd!

149
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,840
Honami, who's representing the athletes, is waving to them!

150
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,090
The cheering continues unabated!

151
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,760
Oh, Honami is now waving behind her!

152
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,800
The fans are really charged up, Saito-san.

153
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,470
Yes.

154
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,730
If this is what we get in the opening ceremonies, what will happen in the Honami-Inokuma match?




155
00:11:52,060 --> 00:12:00,320
Indeed, will we see Honami battle Inokuma for the 48 kg slot in the Olympics?

156
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,580
Oh! Look at this! Honami has stopped in front of Inokuma!

157
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,370
Sparks are already flying between them even before their match!

158
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,880
Oh, I see you trimmed your hair. It's very becoming.

159
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,130
I hope you'll put just as much effort into our match.




160
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,720
A-Apparently there was an exchange of words!

161
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,940
The arena went momentarily silent in the face of the tension between these two!

162
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,360
The tension isn't just between those two.

163
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,860
Every athlete here must be tense!


164
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,360
Laugh or cry,

165
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,370
today will determine who will represent this country for her weight class at Barcelona!

166
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,620
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois! Un, deux, trois!

167
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,380
Faster! Steady your pivot foot!

168
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,710
Should Yawara-san be doing this? Her match is about to start!



169
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,430
Beanpole's being a Nervous Nellie, so Yawara's helping her relax.

170
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,390
We haven't seen her father,
 Honami's coach, in the arena.

171
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,180
Don't say that right now!

172
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,350
Wh-What the hell, All Sports ?

173
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,360
He's probably sneaking around and peeking in 'cause he knows he's no match for me!

174
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,230
Inokuma-san?



175
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:28,280
We will now conduct the initial 48 kg-and-under match of the first round.

176
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,290
All right, you're up, Yawara! Get out there!

177
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,460
The arena is thundering!

178
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,920
Inokuma Yawara has finally arrived!

179
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,840
During her one-year absence, Honami Sayaka has been sitting atop her throne,

180
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,890
but judging by these cheers, she's still a crowd favorite!




181
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,890
However, will her hiatus prove to be too much of a handicap, Saito-san?

182
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,180
That's a good point.


183
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,640
A player's senses can become dull after a long absence from battle.

184
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,020
Focus, Inokuma-san!

185
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,360
Relax and go after her!

186
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,860
Inokuma will be facing another favorite to win, Tsukushi U's Ogaki, who's here to win!



187
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,040
The two players step toward the center of the ring!

188
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,370
This spotlight match is about to begin!

189
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,790
Give it everything you've got, Yawara.

190
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm sure your father is in that arena, watching you.

191
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,470
Give it your best shot.

192
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,380
Even if you're facing your father...

193
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,890
no, because you're facing your father, give it your best shot!

194
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,100
Dad...</i>

195
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,440
Bow!

196
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,370
Hajime!


197
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,120
I-Ippon! Done!

198
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,750
Inokuma Yawara came back strong!

199
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,260
Her thunderous Ippon Zeoi blew away any questions about her year-long absence!

200
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
All right!


201
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,260
That Ippon Zeoi was sharper than anything we've seen before!

202
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,270
Has Inokuma come back stronger than ever?

203
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,770
M-Master!

204
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,230
Well, that's good for a start.


205
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,070
Yawara-san's made a complete comeback!

206
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,360
Th-That's right.

207
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,070
If Yawara-san beats Sayaka-san, then I'm out of a jam!

208
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,240
Sayaka-san will postpone her marriage yet again, leaving me a free man!

209
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Inokuma!

210
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,370
Yawara-san!

211
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,250
Inokuma-san!



212
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,170
You did it!

213
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,420
You'll definitely get your ticket to Barcelona at this rate!

214
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,090
Yeah!

215
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,840
Yawara-chan!


216
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,630
We just caught that, Yawara-chan!

217
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,260
My God, that was so cool!

218
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,300
Guys! You came!

219
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,760
Of course we did!

220
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,060
This is the big tournament! It will determine if you two go to the Olympics!

221
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,520
Thanks, guys!


222
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,560
Now I know you'll be on the Olympic team!

223
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
You too, Fujiko-san!

224
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
Let's make sure we cheer for them.

225
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,440
Yeah!

226
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,540
My word. So much excitement about one little win.

227
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,950
The crowds are roaring again!

228
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,990
Honami Sayaka makes her appearance!

229
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:24,000
Honami, who reigned throughout the past year as the queen of women's judo!

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,960
Will we see a battle between the current queen and the former queen, Inokuma Yawara?

231
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Hajime!

232
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,850
I-Ippon! Done!



233
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,020
Only five seconds! And with a Deashi Barai Ippon!

234
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,810
Sh-She's strong!

235
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,030
Very powerful indeed!


236
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,660
She showed us how eerily powerful she is, without using any elaborate techniques!

237
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,620
I-I knew it. Sayaka-san is too strong!


238
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,120
There's simply no point holding onto the status quo.

239
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,830
Sayaka-san will defeat Yawara-san and then come running to marry me!

240
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,630
H-Honami's really good!



241
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,960
This is great! This is great indeed!

242
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,840
We needed that to happen in order to keep things interesting!

243
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,340
Now then, Beanpole's up next!

244
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,230
It's almost time for your match, Fujiko-san!

245
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,330
Don't worry.

246
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,230
You've worked so hard! I know you can do it!

247
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,860
Just throw her down with your "un, deux, trois"!

248
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,110
Fuku-chan!

249
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,320
Mommy can't do it! She's too scared!

250
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,580
Mommy just can't handle it in the clutch!

251
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,830
What? You're a born loser anyway!

252
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,330
Dad! Mom!

253
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,670
First of all, you were nuts to practice judo right after giving birth!

254
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,050
But you made it this far,
 thanks to everyone's support!

255
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,260
That's right!


256
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,350
Just be grateful you can be in this tournament and give it your best shot!

257
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,560
Dad... Mom...

258
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,650
You have nothing to lose, 
so just do all you can out there!

Barcelona#

260
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,280
Dear!


261
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,240
Hey, Beanpole! Saddle up and quit laying about!

262
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,330
Y-Yes, sir!


263
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,330
That must have relaxed you. Your parents are really nice.

264
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,840
Y-Yeah, but now I feel even more pressure!

265
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,800
Sign: Passionate Spain
Barcelona#


266
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,180
How could you be so stupid to keep this in your pocket?!

267
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,140
It will only make Fujiko nervous if she sees it!

268
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,390
But you said yourself there's a chance she'll go to Barcelona!

269
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,810
I-I didn't say we're actually going there.

270
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,780
My parents have never traveled overseas.

271
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,780
Huh?


272
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,250
They've been so busy managing their shop in Shizuoka

273
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,820
that they've never even gone on a honeymoon!

274
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,160
They must really be looking forward to a trip to Barcelona!

275
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,040
What the devil are you griping about, now of all times?!

276
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,920
Your opponent's waiting for you!

277
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,670
Y-Yes, sir!

278
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,760
We have another star athlete making her appearance!

279
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,170
Here's Hanazono Fujiko,

280
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,050
née Ito Fujiko, who supposedly retired because of her marriage and the birth of her child!

281
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,520
Remember, you've got nothing to lose!

282
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,060
Go out there and give it your best shot!

283
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,810
But you're just saying that!</i>

284
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,940
Hajime!

285
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,030
No, Fujiko-san! You need to relax more!

286
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,700
What's with you?!

287
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,110
You're too stiff!

288
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,620
I have to go. I have to go and bring them with me!</i>

289
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,450
Barcelona!

290
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,460
Fujiko-san!

291
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,710
Waza Ari!

292
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,630
O-Our Barcelona trip!

293
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,710
I knew it was too good to be true!

294
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,590
Watch out! You're about to be pinned!

295
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,720
Get out of there!

296
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,300
Mate!

297
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,480
Do your best, Onoda-san!

298
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,230
H-Honey, is it really hopeless?

299
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,730
Of course it is! Fujiko isn't going to the Olympics!

300
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,450
S-Still, I'd really like to go to Barcelona!


301
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,220
Mama-san judo player Hanazono Fujiko gave up a Waza Ari.

302
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,450
She's now in trouble!


303
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,960
Mom and Dad are really looking forward to going!</i>

304
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,460
Barcelona!</i>

305
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,460
Yuko!

306
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,880
Fujiko-san, watch your opponent!

307
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,970
Keep fighting!

308
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,760
Barcelona!

309
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,970
Throw that pamphlet away!

310
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:53,480
I-It's no use! My parents want to go, but it's completely hopeless!</i>

311
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,400
Focus, Fujiko-san!

312
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,440
You're the reason that I'm even here today!

313
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,440
If you don't give it your best here, then what?!

314
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,950
I know, but...</i>



315
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,700
"Un, deux, trois"! Remember your style of judo!

316
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,210
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois. Un—</i>

317
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,210
Now!

318
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,540
Deux!

319
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,460
Ippon! Done!

320
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,800
What a huge comeback!

321
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,470
Hanazono Fujiko gets an Ouchi Gari Ippon!

322
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,470
I-I won!

323
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,800
You did it, Fujiko-san!

324
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,850
D-Dear!

325
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,930
Honey!

326
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,140
Barcelona?!

327
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,480
Calm down. This is just the first round!


328
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,530
This is the Olympic qualifying tournament,
 the Women's All-Japan Selected Championships!

329
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,240
The spotlight's now on Inokuma Yawara's second-round match!

330
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,110
Oh!


331
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,120
Inokuma announced her full comeback with a stirring Ippon Zeoi in the first round!

332
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,290
Will she play her trump card again in this second round?

333
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,250
Hajime!

334
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,760
Yes! Go, go!

335
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,510
Right there!

336
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,760
Ippon!

337
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,680
All right!


338
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,100
An Ippon Zeoi Ippon!

339
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,480
Inokuma Yawara is through the second round!

340
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,060
Hello?

341
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,990
I'm back.

342
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,210
Inokuma Yawara advances to the third round with a magnificent Ippon win!

343
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Yawara! Don't get carried away just 'cause you got lucky with those lazy Ippon Zeois!

344
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,690
I'm not getting carried away!

345
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,740
But Fujiko-san is amazing,
 even though she just gave birth.

346
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,410
It really feels like she's getting closer to Barcelona!




347
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,240
Barcelona, my eye!

348
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,080
If she don't start working her keister off, that'll be a no-go!

349
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,580
That's not true!

350
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,670
Fujiko-san, you can do it!

351
