Presented by FroZen-EviL!

3
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,030
Inokuma goes for a Tomoe Nage!

4
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,030
Yuko!

5
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,500
Yuko! Inokuma's Tomoe Nage earns her a Yuko!

6
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,520
She gets a danged Yuko all 'cause she got cold feet the first time!

7
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,500
Y-You're right. She did hesitate that one time.

8
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,750
She used that Tomoe Nage against her dad when she was five.

9
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,680
Huh?

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,510
She beat her dad with that move?

11
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,500
Father!

12
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,250
Still, the fact she used that move means she's gotten past everything.

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,090
The match isn't over by a long shot, Yawara.

14
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,480
The real fight begins now.

15
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:27,580
Ever Since I Met You...

16
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,840
Only fifteen seconds left!



17
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,420
Honami will be looking to recover with one of her Newazas,

18
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,590
but Inokuma, who now has the lead, will probably avoid any direct engagement!

19
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,910
Well, if Honami can use her overwhelming Newazas, it's still anyone's game!

20
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,790
"Has the lead," my patootie!

21
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,600
If she's even thinking about winning on points, I ain't taking her to Barcelona!




22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,610
A Yuko? Our feud will not end with a damned Yuko!</i>

23
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,100
Only fifteen seconds left. Don't you dare evade me!</i>

24
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,570
Come and fight me, Inokuma Yawara!</i>



25
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,600
The death match of the century has come down to this!

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,670
Will Inokuma maintain her lead, or will Honami make a huge comeback?!

27
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,130
Hajime!

28
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,130
Fight me, Inokuma Yawara!

29
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,630
Whoa!

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,640
Both players... are engaging each...

31
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Don't!

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,730
Ip...

33
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,700
Ippon!

34
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,910
Done!

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,470
Banzai!

36
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:11,480
I-Inokuma Yawara gets an Ippon win with her Ippon Zeoi!

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,480
It's done! She's won the death match! Holy cow!

38
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,240
Even with her injured right arm,
 she unleashed a powerful Ippon Zeoi!

39
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,330
Just incredible!

40
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,580
Honami's still down! She's too dumbfounded to get up!



41
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,380
Wow, holy crap!

42
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh, tomorrow's headline... Let's see. Oh, yeah!

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,930
Did you get that, Kamoda?!

44
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,080
Yeah!

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,920
H-Hey, let us through!

46
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,090
Yawara-chan!

47
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,430
Honami had been watching out for Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi the entire match!

48
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,460
Yes, but she got desperate after she fell behind on points!

49
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,560
Inokuma made magnificent use of that momentary lapse!

50
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,310
It took her that long? Retraining!

51
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,940
There were only three seconds left on the clock!

52
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,580
That Ippon came literally at the last moment!

53
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,320
Inokuma has won the 48 kg-and-unders!

54
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,540
Sayaka-san.



55
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,500
Oh, take a look at this! Inokuma Yawara has approached Honami's side!

56
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,010
You were incredibly strong, Sayaka-san.

57
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,760
But I really had fun. I hope we play another match.

58
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,010
Wha—

59
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,140
Also, you lost your false tooth again.

60
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,270
Oh! Inokuma has taken Honami's hand!

61
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,000
What a moving handshake! They are now receiving a thunderous ovation!

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,250
They did great! These two players have done splendidly!

63
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,480
This wasn't what you promised!

64
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,120
What did you mean, Sayaka-san will definitely win?

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,500
Yawara-chan won!




66
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,130
I thought you were going to take Yawara-chan after she lost to Sayaka-san! Now what?

67
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,890
Actually, this works out.

68
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,350
No, it doesn't!

69
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,260
You were supposed to take Yawara-chan while I took Kosaku.

70
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,130
It's fine.


71
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:24,290
If Sayaka-san loses, there will be another fateful showdown, and our marriage will be put on hold.

72
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,030
Shin-chan's outta trouble!

73
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,240
Hello, status and prestige!

74
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,830
Congratulations!

75
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,090
That was an incredible Ippon Zeoi!

76
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,210
Give us your thoughts!

77
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,210
Ow! Stop shoving!

78
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,130
Matsuda-san?

79
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,840
Yawara-san!

80
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,440
Inokuma!

81
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,860
Guys...

82
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,410
Ino... Ino... Ino...

83
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,410
Fujiko-san!

84
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,120
Inokuma-san!

85
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,130
Congratulations!

86
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,130
Inokuma Yawara is now on the Barcelona Olympic team!

87
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,390
Yawara.

88
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,400
This will be a nice victory party.

89
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,860
Yes!



90
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,860
Milady, please get in the car! I'll handle things here!

91
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,070
Miss Honami, a comment!

92
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,750
Please!

93
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,750
Over here!

94
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,960
A comment?

95
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,870
Honami!

96
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,880
"Fun"?

97
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,880
She said it was f-fun?

98
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,150
Milady!

99
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:26,860
All-Japan Women's Selected Judo Championship Barcelona Olympics Final Qualifying Tournament#

100
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,870
Retraining!

101
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,920
But first we'll have our big victory party!

102
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,170
So will you fine gentlemen be coming along? There will be boat-wrap sushi sets!

103
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,930
Is it true? I can go to Barcelona?

104
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,300
Not just "can"!

105
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,930
You're the official 61 kg-and-under representative on the Olympic team, Ms. Ito Fujiko!

106
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,940
No, right now I'm Mrs. Hanazono Fujiko!

107
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,130
Indeed, you are. Going to the Olympics as a "Mama-san athlete" is a brilliant achievement.

108
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,840
Be sure to show us in Barcelona
 how strong a mother can really be!





109
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,630
Ah, the mic!

110
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,240
Don't, Fuku-chan! Spit it out!

111
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,850
Stop that, Fuku-chan! Spit it!

112
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,960
My mic...

113
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,170
Oh yeah, where did our star,
 Inokuma Yawara, head off to?

114
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,130
Mm-hmm. So you watched, Mom?

115
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,370
My arm? It's fine. Grandpa took care of it.

116
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,680
I feel sorry for you, Mom. Grandpa has invited a lot of reporters to our house.

117
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,140
Dad was at our house?

118
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,660
He was! We watched your matches on TV together!

119
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,660
He did?

120
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,850
Where is he now?

121
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,660
Well, right now he's...

122
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,360
H-He left already.

123
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,660
But still, your father said...

124
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,680
That was a brilliant match.

125
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,360
Please tell Yawara...

126
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
that she did really great.

127
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,810
Why don't you tell that to Yawara yourself? She'll be back soon, you know.

128
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,180
No.

129
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,150
I have to get to the airport.

130
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:43,660
When I went to France with Miss Sayaka,
 their judo team invited me to be their coach.

131
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,810
But...



132
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,670
But you don't have to leave so soon.

133
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,700
This time I'm not running or hiding from her.

134
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,670
Once I've settled down in Paris, I'll send her my address.

135
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
So... So that means... that means?

136
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,870
Yeah, I know I've made her worry all these years.

137
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,690
When the time comes, we'll stroll down the Champs-Élysées as father and daughter.

138
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,250
But...

139
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,650
only after the Barcelona Olympics.

140
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,660
Make sure Yawara knows...

141
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,920
that an even stronger opponent awaits her in Barcelona.

142
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,740
She must not lower her guard for a second, not until she leaves Barcelona.



143
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,180
Yawara, did you hear that? That's what your father said before he left!

144
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,080
The Champs-Élysées! You'll stroll down the Champs-Élysées with your father!

145
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,420
That's in Paris!

146
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,190
Yawara, are you listening?

147
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,260
Yes.

148
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,460
I'm listening.

149
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,160
I'm glad for you, Mom.



150
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,290
I'm really glad.

151
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,960
Really.

Honami Sayaka's Championship Victory Party

160
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:46,200
I cannot express my solemn appreciation that you would grace me with your presence!

161
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,990
I, Honami Sayaka, have attained numerous brilliant achievements!

162
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,640
Winner of the World Horse Racing Championship!

163
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,210
Winner of the European Skiing Open!

164
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,690
The one who bested Navratilova in tennis!

165
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,240
The one who mesmerized the crowds with her rhythmic gymnastics!

166
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,470
Plus other countless and glorious accomplishments!

167
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,180
Indeed, I have ruled as the queen everywhere I have gone!

168
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,940
There is nothing left that I have yet to attain!

169
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,190
Ladies and gentlemen,

170
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,320
for me, as I now sit atop of the world,

171
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,280
a toast!

172
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,880
Well, I welcome you, Kazamatsuri-san. Please, enjoy yourself tonight.

173
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,850
This is a magnificent party, Sayaka-san.



174
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,180
Also, that was a magnificent match you played.

175
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,180
How right you are. The victory should have been mine.

176
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,400
No, I was the real victor.

177
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,570
If it weren't for that Tomoe Nage,

178
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:08,280
that sneaky Tomoe Nage she did while faking the "injury" my Jyuji Gatame did to her arm,

179
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,160
I would have had her groveling on that mat!

180
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Also, despite the fact she struggled mightily against me,

181
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,540
she had the nerve to engage in false bravado after the match!

182
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,420
She said, "I had fun! Let's play again!"

183
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,430
Honestly, how much of a twisted and desperate sore loser is that Inokuma Yawara?

184
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,820
Actually...

185
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,620
That wasn't false bravado, Sayaka-san.



186
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,770
That's who Yawara-san really is.

187
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:49,030
Yawara-san truly enjoys herself when she plays against a highly competent rival.

188
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:55,290
If she played against a really strong opponent,
 she'd still say those words, even if she lost.

189
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,790
"I had fun."

190
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,230
Sayaka-san, Yawara-san has acknowledged your skills.

191
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,300
She sees you as a really strong judoka.

192
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,470
I couldn't care less!

193
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,050
Sayaka-san!

194
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,220
I don't need an Inokuma Yawara to recognize my strength!

195
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,820
I... I don't need her to tell me that I'm strong!

196
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,440
Sayaka-san...






197
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,510
I'm strong! There is nothing I cannot attain!

198
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,550
Not before, not now, and not from here on out!

199
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,820
I'm...

200
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:48,060
Sayaka-san, you're absolutely right. You are strong. You're...

201
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,910
Sayaka-san... is crying?</i>

202
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,610
She's so arrogant, so domineering, so defiant, the very definition of "prideful."</i>

203
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,020
And now she's crying.</i>

204
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,490
Huh?</i>

205
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,450
Wh-What's happening?</i>

206
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,610
W-Wait...</i>

207
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
Impossible!</i>

208
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,370
Sayaka-san...</i>

209
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,730
Congratulations, Milady!

210
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:30,570
...then you are a true Kuroda warrior!

211
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,190
Brilliant, Master!

212
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,260
Here's Hanazono!

213
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,990
Way to go!

214
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,720
Oh! I'm going to dance too!

215
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,990
I'd better not see you stripping!

216
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,540
Stop it, Hanazono-san!

217
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,000
Fujiko!



218
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,150
We're so happy, Fujiko!

219
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,010
We're going to Barcelona. It's good to be alive!

220
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,010
Fujiko, I'm so proud of you!
 You're the world's number one daughter!

221
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,470
Okay, okay, I get it!

222
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,010
Eat up! And add 500 more sushi!

223
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,520
Okay, so your father said that.

224
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,840
Don't lower your guard until you leave Barcelona, huh?

225
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,010
Yes.

226
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,990
I still gotta say, your match was really amazing.

227
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,990
I hope we get to see more good matches in Barcelona.

228
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,280
It's thanks to you, Matsuda-san.

229
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,460
Huh?

230
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Win, Yawara-san!

231
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,560
Win and go to Barcelona!

232
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,260
Get the Olympic gold medal!

233
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,010
Don't take away my dream!

234
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,020
If you weren't rooting for me, I would surely have lost.


235
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,600
Yeah, right!

236
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,990
Yawara-san.

237
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,720
Uh, well...

238
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,000
Uh, I...

239
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,510
I...

240
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,760
Ever... Ever since I met you...

241
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,020
I've always li—

242
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,980
...liked them gold medals!

243
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,900
Good Luck, Yawara-chan

244
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,030
Good Luck, Yawara-chan

245
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,160
Guts! Fujiko-san!

246
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,120
Yes, ever since I met you...</i>

247
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,130
Ever since I laid eyes on you... I've always...</i>

248
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,340
owari no kane ga natte kimi ga seki wo tatsu

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,340
The final bell rang, and you left your seat.

250
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:13,560
ki ga tsukeba itsudemo kimi dake wo mitsumeteta

251
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:13,560
Before I knew it, I was staring at you.

252
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:21,400
boku no soba de kimi wa chigau koi ni hikarete

253
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:21,400
But you flirted with others right beside me

254
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:30,040
omowazu boku wa ashi wo sukumeteshimatta ne

255
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:30,040
and I unconsciously retreated back.

256
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:38,530
peeji wo meguru to itsumo soko ni kimi ga ita

257
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:38,530
Whenever I turned the page, there you were.

00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:47,810
nooto no rakugaki itsumo soko ni kimi ga ita

259
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:47,810
You were also in the scribbles of my notebook.

260
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:03,230
arubamu wo nagamete wa natsukashiku omounda

261
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:03,230
Looking at my photo album takes me back.

262
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:11,200
nigiyakana sazameki ga mimi ni nn kodama suru

263
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:11,200
The bustling sounds from back then still ring in my ears.

sugiyuku toki no naka de ano toki no

269
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:37,170
As the days go past, I wonder what

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:49,020
nakama wa ima nani wo katatteiru darou

271
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:49,020

Go get 'em, Yawara-san! Do your Ippon Zeoi!

281
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:00,060
Thank you for watching! –FroZen-EviL#
