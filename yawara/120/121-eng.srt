Presented by FroZen-EviL!

3
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,870
I-Ippon! Done!

4
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,830
Inokuma Yawara came back strong!

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,210
I-Ippon! Done!

6
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,470
Ippon! Done!

7
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,930
What a huge comeback!

8
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,470
Hanazono Fujiko wins with an Ouchi Gari Ippon!

9
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm back.

10
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:19,030
You're Going to Barcelona

11
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,680
Um...

12
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,900
Welcome home!

13
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,400
May I come in?

14
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,320
What are you saying? This is your home after all!

15
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,380
Come.

16
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,220
Do you want something to eat? Or would you like a bath?

17
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,510
No.

18
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,970
I want to watch television.

19
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,730
There she goes!

20
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,690
And she's got it! Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi Ippon!

21
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
It's a crushing one at that! Only twelve seconds in!

22
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,060
With that lightning-fast Ippon Zeoi,

23
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,370
Inokuma Yawara advances to the 48 kg-and-under semifinals!

24
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,870
You're really going full-speed ahead, Master Jigoro!

25
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,170
The way things are going,
 there's no need to fear Honami Sayaka.

26
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,460
That spot on the Olympic team is all but yours!

27
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,170
Got that right!

28
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,260
We came here to win!

29
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,350
Honami's secret weapon against Yawara-san appears to be the Tomoe Nage.

30
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,180
Are you prepared to face that?

31
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,060
I don't give a tinker's cuss about that sloppy Tomoe!

32
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,190
Besides, I gotta know something.

33
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,780
I'm throwing a victory party at my house. You guys coming or what?

34
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,150
Oh, can we?

35
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,240
Sure! Put up your hands if you like sushi!

36
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,660
I do!

37
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,910
All right, so 50 servings, eh?

38
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,420
Nope, that won't be enough. How about 60 servings?

39
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,550
So you're inviting the entire press corp?

40
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,510
Is that right?

41
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,420
Yeah, 'cause I'm the coach!

42
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,560
Now, about your son Kojiro-san...

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,510
Hey, is that Honami's coach?

44
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,180
What luck! We might even get Coach Inokuma Kojiro!



45
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,230
Sayaka-san, this time you will defeat Yawara-san.</i>

46
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,270
But we will also part ways when you do that.</i>

47
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,150
I've made up my mind.</i>

48
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,820
I don't need money or status.</i>

49
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,660
I've decided to live for love of Yawara-san.</i>

50
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,160
Coach Kazamatsuri! Do you know where Coach Inokuma Kojiro is?

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,620
He's here in the arena, right?

52
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,620
Huh?

53
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,250
Please, can you give us some information pertaining to Inokuma Kojiro?

54
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,630
Hey! How about a hundred servings?!

55
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,380
Do you mean that, Jigoro-san?!

56
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,340
So we each get two servings?!

57
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,930
Oh, he's getting away!

58
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,390
After him!

59
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,520
Wait!

60
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,020
Don't lose him!

61
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,860
Dammit, where is he?!

62
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,400
He's on the west side!

63
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,370
I swear. They're just like jackals!

64
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,490
I don't have time for them right now!

65
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,410
I'm at the crossroads of my life here.

66
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,710
Well, there won't be any problems if Yawara-san wins.

67
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,340
Yes, there will be no problems or obstacles between us!

68
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,550
Sorry!

69
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,350
Hajime!

70
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,890
Honami's as fast as ever!
 And she's attacking strongly!

71
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,820
Oh! An Okuri Ashi Barai!

72
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,320
Sh-She's strong!</i>

73
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,320
Ippon! Done!

74
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,910
She is strong, very tough to beat!



75
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,710
Honami did not give her opponent an inch!

76
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,300
She secured her place in the 48kg-and-under semis right after Inokuma!

77
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,380
That Ippon happened so fast!

78
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,430
You did very well out there. Here's your towel.

79
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,270
Tokunaga?

80
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,190
Ma'am?


81
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,900
Is everything in place for the victory celebration?

82
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,910
Yes! We've invited 2,000 for the 6:00 PM event at the Honami Prince's Phoenix Room!

83
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,910
Very good.


84
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,620
She's very powerful indeed.

85
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,710
What do you think? She still hasn't shown any flashy techniques.



86
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,960
Yes, but the techniques she has used were superb! Magnificent even!

87
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,300
There seems to be a bizarre force burning quietly inside her like a bright blue flame!

88
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,390
Now then, tournament favorite Hanazono is continuing her match in the B Block!

89
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,700
Oh, Hanazono's pinned and is in real trouble!

90
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,370
Mate! Done!

91
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,620
Dammit! It's come down to a decision!

92
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,870
Don't worry! Fujiko-san was the one on the offensive!




93
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,830
Your decisions!

94
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,840
The flags show red and white!

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,670
It's Hanazono!

96
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,340
Hanazono barely makes it to the semifinals!

97
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,270
All right! You did it!

98
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,860
You had me on tenterhooks!

99
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,320
H-Honey, we might actually go... to B-Barcelona!

100
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,870
D-Don't, dear. Don't get your hopes up!

101
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,580
Sh-She still has two matches left!

102
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,620
Hanazono did really great!

103
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,580
She did really well getting this far!

104
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,630
Fujiko-san has done really well!

105
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,460
Yes, she's truly a great player.


106
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,300
Indeed, and she's also a very good friend to Yawara.

107
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,800
She is.

108
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,850
It's thanks to Fujiko-san that Yawara came this far.

109
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,440
I completely agree.

110
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,780
You must know everything.

111
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,410
You must have always watched over Yawara.

112
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,580
I'll put on some tea!

113
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,420
You're not cheering for her at the arena?

114
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,380
I'm afraid not. I'm cooking right now.

115
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,420
Cooking?

116
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,880
I'm cooking for Yawara's victory party.

117
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,350
I knew I smelled something nice.

118
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,690
Do you want to help yourself to some?

119
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,400
Are you sure?

120
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Just have a sample.

121
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,340
All right! An Ippon!

122
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,300
There was absolutely no need to worry about her year-long absence!

123
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,680
She's made it to the finals!

124
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
And with all Ippon wins!

125
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,020
You're in top form, Inokuma-san!

126
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,190
The arena's filled with people waiting to see your match with Honami Sayaka!



127
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,940
But the way you're going, 
you'll be eating Honami's lunch!

128
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,440
Inokuma-san?

129
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,150
Are you free tonight?

130
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:26,330
At the Honami Prince's Phoenix Room,
 I will be having 2,000 guests for a party.

131
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,040
It will be my victory celebration. Come if you like.

132
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,180
Don't worry about her, Inokuma-san. She's just acting tough.

133
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,930
And what's with that stupid laugh of hers? Gosh!

134
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,940
eye catch

141
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,200
It's now the 48 kg-and-under semifinals, and here comes Honami Sayaka!

142
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,410
She's reigned for the past year as the veritable queen of women's judo!

143
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,790
Today she's won everything with Ippons.

144
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,790
Will she maintain her momentum into the finals?

145
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,670
She's facing Goto Megumi!

146
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,830
Can she stop Honami with the tenacious judo she's known for?

147
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,420
Hajime!

148
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,850
Goto's doing great! This match is starting off well for her!

149
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,560
The two players are attacking and defending fiercely!

150
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,770
Oh, a Koshi Guruma!

151
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,560
Goto hangs on!

152
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,060
Now she's going for an Ushiro Goshi! 

153
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,900
Honami's Osoto!

154
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,360
Ippon! Done!

155
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,490
An Osoto Gari Ippon! Honami advances to the finals!






156
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,910
Honami came here today wielding her speed and skill,

157
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,370
and now she's made it to the final match of the 48 kg-and-unders!

158
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,920
So what does this mean, Saito-san?

159
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,630
Yes, we're finally getting it!

160
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,040
It's finally here!</i>

161
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,550
Finally...</i>

162
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,050
Finally...</i>

163
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,560
Inokuma and Honami will face each other in the final round!

164
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,620
Yes, we've been waiting for this!

165
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,450
But something's off about Sayaka today.

166
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,460
What happened to that Left Uchi Mata? Or that Tomoe Nage at the All-Japan?

167
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Her moves are too plain for a flashy celebutante.

168
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,550
What is Sayaka planning exactly?




169
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,470
She's very strong indeed.</i>

170
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,050
Farewell, Sayaka-san. Farewell, status and prestige.</i>

171
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,430
Once you win, it'll be impossible to find me.</i>

172
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,060
Because at that time, I'll be with Yawara-san.</i>

173
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,240
Now for our other main attraction.



174
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,110
Hanazono Fujiko's match has started, and...

175
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,980
Trois!

176
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,530
Hanazono's Uchi Mata!

177
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,990
Is it enough?

178
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,620
All right!

179
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,660
Yuko!

180
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,080
Yes!

181
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,290
She's ahead on points!

182
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,420
Be careful! She's coming with a pin even in the little time remaining!

183
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,670
Mate! Done!

184
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,680
She won!

185
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,230
Honey! She won! Fujiko actually won!


186
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,150
Why did you crumple up that pamphlet?!

187
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,070
But, you told me to throw it away, honey!

188
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,570
No, we might actually be making a trip to Barcelona!

189
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,660
Honey!

190
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,080
You're awesome, Fujiko-san! You're in the finals now!

191
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,660
I-Inokuma-san!

192
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,700
Hanazono, we did it!

193
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,170
Yes! There's nothing to be said, now that she's made it this far!

194
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,210
Let's go... Let's go to Barcelona together, Inokuma-san!

195
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:06,630
Of course!

196
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,590
Ow!

197
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,880
G-Grandpa!

198
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,550
Whaddaya mean you're going to Barcelona?

199
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,470
Not with that lazy pusillanimous crap you've been pulling, you nincompoop!

200
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,390
Ow...

201
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,940
Listen! You keep doing that bush-league judo, you won't make it to Barcelona!

202
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,110
Yawara! Same goes for you too!

203
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,110
If you wanna eat good sushi at your victory party, you'd better win and make it snappy!

204
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,860
O-Okay!




205
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,870
Because we are at full capacity, we are refusing further entry. Please accept our apologies.

206
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,290
Full capacity? You should be able to let us in!

207
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,710
Let us watch!

208
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,590
Let us see the Inokuma-Honami match!

209
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,880
Yeah! Let us in, you bastards!

210
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,300
What should we do? This is nearly a riot!



211
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,340
One could call this an enthusiastic response.

212
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,390
You'd better tighten up them garters!

213
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,560
At last it's the final round.

214
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,350
Get those quick Ippons and snatch them tickets to Barcelona!

215
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,730
Just focus! I know you can do it, Fujiko-san!

216
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,240
Yes! Give Inokuma the momentum she needs for her big match!

217
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,570
O-Okay.



218
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,620
Of course, but that's not what it means!

219
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,700
I'm her mother! I'm the most "relevant party" she has!

220
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,250
That's not what we mean by...

221
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,000
Then what does it mean?!

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,500
Fujiko!

223
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,460
You have nothing to lose,
 so don't think of anything!

224
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,040
Clear your mind!

225
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,090
That's right! We're thankful that you came this far!

226
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,890
Dad, Mom...

227
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,600
What is it?

228
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,770
You don't have your passports, do you?

229
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,310
Be sure to get them.

230
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,570
I'm sending you to Barcelona!

231
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,400
Wh-What are you saying, Fujiko?

232
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,120
H-He's right! Th-That has... never crossed our minds! Right, dear?

233
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,290
Of course that's right! Clear your mind! Clear it!

234
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,420
Watch me, Fuku-chan.

235
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,510
No matter what happens, your mother will give it everything she has!

236
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,650
Sign: Inokuma#

237
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,650
We're now starting the championship round of the 61 kg-and-unders.

238
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,480
Spotlight player Hanazono Fujiko has done well making it this far.

239
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,030
Facing her is the top achiever in her weight class, Mitsuhashi Yoshiko!

240
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,990
Who will win the championship?

241
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,490
Fujiko-san's final match is about to begin!

242
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:41,990
Mm-hmm.

243
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,540
The ticket to Barcelona is riding on this match!

244
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,500
Hajime!

245
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,880
Both players struggle for the upper hand!

246
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,550
Yes?

247
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,470
Is something wrong?

248
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,970
This is delicious!

249
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,480
This is food for Yawara's victory party!

250
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,820
Also...

251
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,410
This is food for Fujiko-san's victory party.

252
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,830
Yes! Doing great!

253
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,130
Fight her!

254
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,250
Maintain your own rhythm, Fujiko-san!

255
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,380
Go get her, Mitsuhashi!

256
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,710
Keep moving! Keep moving!

257
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,920
That beanpole's no match for you!

258
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,970
I need to give Inokuma-san momentum for her big match!</i>

259
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,930
She's in a good position!

260
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,850
Okay, get her there!

261
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,600
Un!

262
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,520
Deux!

263
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,020
Trois!

264
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,230
Is this it?





265
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,990
Waza Ari!

266
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,620
Waza Ari! Her Uchi Mata netted her a Waza Ari!

267
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,990
Hanazono Fujiko gets on the board!

268
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,580
All right!

269
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,450
Wow!

270
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,920
Barcelona!

271
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,500
Fujiko!

272
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,880
Master!

273
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Can't you get a dang Ippon, you dummy?!

274
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,380
What are you doing, Mitsuhashi!

275
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,510
You knew that beanpole was coming with that Uchi Mata!

276
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,770
Honey, it's right before us! It is!

277
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,520
Barcelona!

278
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,900
Tsurikomi Goshi!

279
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Waza Ari!

280
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,070
Oh, this time it's Mitsuhashi! Mitsuhashi's Tsurikomi Goshi gets her a Waza Ari!

281
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,120
M-Master!

282
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,200
This is what happens if you don't get an Ippon with that Uchi Mata, you yutz!

283
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,330
Yes, yes, that's the way!

284
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,330
Keep that up, Mitsuhashi!

285
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,460
She's... strong!</i>

286
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,840
Hajime!

287
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,100
I can't lose!</i>

288
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,440
Inokuma-san, watch!</i>

289
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Hanazono-san, watch!</i>

290
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,940
Fuku-chan, watch!</i>

291
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,900
There goes her Ouchi Gari!

292
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,740
Bring her down!

293
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,820
Yuko!

294
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,280
Hanazono's Ouchi Gari gets a Yuko!

295
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,620
She's in the lead again!

296
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,620
Barcelona!

297
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,200
Fujiko!

298
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,340
Please, one more! Let me win with my Nutcracker!</i>

299
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,380
Un! Deux! Trois!

300
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,010
No! Get away!







301
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,140
Oh! Mitsuhashi lifts her up!

302
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,890
She saw it coming?

303
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,730
Yeah.

304
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,270
That Ushiro Goshi she's doing was timed to match Hanazono's Uchi Mata.

305
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,980
During the first couple of blows they exchanged,

306
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,110
she was getting a lock on Hanazono's unique timing and smooth execution.

307
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,670
Hanazono's timing is now predictable,

308
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,120
and she's too tired to execute her moves crisply.

309
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,540
Also, her opponent is now looking out for her Uchi Mata and Ouchi Gari!

310
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,630
Mitsuhashi's Ushiro Goshi gets her a Yuko!




311
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,630
Both players are tied on points,
 with less than two minutes remaining!

312
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,140
I have to do something. I have to do something!</i>

313
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,640
Keep your eyes peeled. Watch her moves!

314
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,140
Don't rush it!

315
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,640
Un! Deux! Trois!

316
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,350
Hanazono's Ouchi Gari!

317
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,690
Koka!

318
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,610
But Mitsuhashi counters with a Kouchi Gari!

319
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,280
Mitsuhashi, who had been playing catch-up, finally leads by a Koka!

320
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,780
Mate!



321
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,410
That Koka may be the top of a slippery slope. A steep one.

322
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,700
I'm done!</i>

323
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,790
It wasn't possible for me to go to Barcelona after all!</i>

324
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,710
Hang in there, Fujiko!

325
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,880
Hey, dear, cheer for her!

326
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,800
Barcelona!


327
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,930
Calm down, Fujiko-san! Play on your own terms!

328
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,520
Fuku-chan!

329
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,020
Oh my! It appears that Hanazono's baby has started crying!

330
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,280
Sorry, Fuku-chan.</i>


331
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Your mommy made a promise</i>

332
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,280
that she would give it all she's got, no matter what happens.</i>

333
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,270
That's right, Mommy will fight hard!</i>

334
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,960
Watch me, Fuku-chan!</i>

335
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Un, deux, trois!

336
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,590
There she goes! Hanazono's Uchi Mata!

337
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:59,890
The Gentle Way Is Not Built in a Day –Jigoro

338
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,110
Fujiko-san, don't rush it! Observe your opponent!

339
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,860
You worthless boob! Can't you just hurry it up and win?!

340
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,870
You can do it! We're all going to Barcelona!

341
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,960
Anyway, Yawara, your match-up with Miss Sayaka is coming up next!

342
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
You'd better wrap it up quick!

343
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,170
Yawara!

344
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,750
First Place for the First Time.

345
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,090
You'll be getting my Ouchi Gari if you miss this.

346
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,840
First Place for the First Time
