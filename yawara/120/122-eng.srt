00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,950
Presented by FroZen-EviL!

3
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,870
Inokuma!

4
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,950
There was absolutely no need to worry about her year-long absence!

5
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,040
She made it to the finals!

6
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,920
Ippon! Done!

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,380
An Osoto Gari Ippon!
 Honami advances to the finals!

8
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,380
Inokuma and Honami will face each other in the final round!

9
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,930
I need to give Inokuma-san momentum for her big match!</i>

10
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,520
But Mitsuhashi counters with a Kouchi Gari!

11
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,100
Koka!

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,560
It's a Koka!

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Mitsuhashi finally leads by a Koka!

14
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,060
Mate!

15
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,650
Calm down, Fujiko-san! Play on your own terms!

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Fuku-chan!

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,490
That's right, Mommy will fight hard!</i>

18
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,160
Watch me, Fuku-chan!</i>

19
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
Un, deux, trois!

20
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,710
There she goes! Hanazono's Uchi Mata!

21
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,640
First Place for the First Time

22
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Trois!

23
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,770
Go!

24
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,640
Fujiko-san!

25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,720
Mitsuhashi!

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,640
Fight it off!

27
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,640
Barcelona!

28
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,640
Fujiko!

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Oh, she didn't get it!

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,740
Is Hanazono Fujiko's maternal strength insufficient for the competitive world?

31
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,750
She's a loser through and through!



32
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,090
There, there!

33
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,510
Fuku-chan! I promised you.</i>

34
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,340
I promised I'd use all my strength to the end.</i>

35
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,890
What's wrong, Fuku-chan?

36
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,810
Is she hungry?

37
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,350
O-Okay, I'll get the milk!

38
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,350
What about your work, Matsuda-san?

39
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,110
Kosaku! Why are you blowing off work?!

40
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,360
Hajime!

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
Less than a minute left!

42
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,870
With Mitsuhashi leading by a Koka, is this the end?

43
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,420
Please... give me one more chance!</i>

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,880
Hanazono with an Ouchi Gari!

45
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,340
But Mitsuhashi fends it off and goes for a Kouchi Gari!

46
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,300
Hanazono hangs on by a thread!

47
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,600
Hanazono Fujiko has really steered clear of danger,

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,400
but she looks like she's in agony, Saito-san!

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,530
Yes, it's her first tournament since giving birth.

50
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,900
She must be quite fatigued out there.

51
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,580
Also, Mitsuhashi has got Hanazono's timing down pat.

52
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,910
It looks like Hanazono's out of options.

53
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,870
There are now less than thirty seconds left!

54
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,420
Fujiko-san!

55
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,420
Pamphlet: Passionate Spain
Barcelona#

56
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,550
She gave us a good dream.

57
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,720
She really did.

58
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,980
Fujiko-san, you did great!
 You gave it your very best!

59
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,190
Hanazono-kun, you don't have a passport, do you?

60
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,400
Huh?

61
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,910
You'll need a passport...
 because you're going to Barcelona!

62
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,160
B-But...

63
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
We're all going!

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,910
We're all going to Barcelona!

65
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,000
Inokuma...

66
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,970
Get her there, Mitsuhashi!

67
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,510
Don't let up till the end!

68
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,850
Fujiko-san! Fight her!

69
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,970
Be careful!

70
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,980
She's shoulder-throwing her!

71
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,230
Mitsuhashi is going for a last offensive move!

72
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,150
Stick a fork in Hanazono!

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,160
I'm sorry Mom, Dad! I'm sorry, Fuku-chan!</i>

74
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,170
Manma!

75
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,670
Fuku-chan!

76
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,050
Manma!

77
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,380
Fuku-chan!</i>

78
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,140
Whoa!

79
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,890
She held on!

80
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,890
Unbelievable!

81
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,890
Hanazono actually withstood that move!

82
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,230
Sh-She talked! Fuku-chan!

83
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,150
Here she comes, Mitsuhashi!

84
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,980
Watch out!

85
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,990
I'll fake an Uchi Mata and do an Ouchi Gari!</i>

86
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,990
Fujiko...

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,580
Less than ten seconds left!

88
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,490
You've got nothing to lose. Do something!

89
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,330
Un! Deux! Trois!

90
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,460
Hanazono goes for her last Uchi Mata!

91
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
But Mitsuhashi blocks it!

92
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,460
Right there!

93
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,970
Hanazono switches to an Ouchi Gari!

94
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,930
Put her down!

95
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,060
Hold on!

96
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,930
Mitsuhashi!

97
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,270
Mitsuhashi isn't going down!

98
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,690
Fall!

99
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,070
Please!

100
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,030
Manma!

101
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,030
Fuku-chan!

102
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,040
It's over.

103
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,500
What happened? Who won?

104
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,880
Yawara-san!

105
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,010
How did the match turn out?

106
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,470
She won.

107
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,850
She did a Morote Gari at the last minute and got a Yuko!

108
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,650
What a huge comeback!

109
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,820
Hanazono gets a Morote Gari Yuko at the very last second!

110
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,660
At this very moment, Hanazono Fujiko has earned her berth to the Barcelona Olympics!

111
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,330
She did it!

112
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,330
Fujiko-san!

113
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,080
Fujiko!

114
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,980
Fujiko-san...

115
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,480
Hanazono-san...

116
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,710
Master, she did it! She really did it!

117
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,540
We're whipping her into shape starting tomorrow!






118
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,550
But I guess we'll let her party tonight!

119
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,720
Fuku-chan!

120
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,550
I did it! Mama kept her promise and gave it all she had!

121
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,680
Manma!

122
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,140
Yes, Mama's right here!

123
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,690
Manma! Manma!

124
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,690
Oh?


125
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,950
Fuku-chan, could it be you weren't saying "mama" but...

126
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,290
"manma"?

127
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,290
Note: Baby talk for "food."#

128
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,210
And what's this smell?

129
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,840
She made a poopy!

130
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,930
Get her diapers!

131
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,310
All right. This time you're up!


132
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,820
Let me slap you on the front page tomorrow with Fujiko-san!

133
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,190
Okay!


134
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Man, this place is about to explode!

135
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,740
I haven't seen so much energy in ages!

136
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,910
You can thank Honami for that.

137
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,990
No, Inokuma!

138
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,830
I need to use the restroom now!

139
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,790
Hey, why are these lines so long?

140
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,840
Hurry up, or we'll miss the final round!

141
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,340
Huh, why is it so crowded?

142
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,800
Geez, I can't hold it if I have to stand in these lines!

143
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,600
Why are the women's restrooms so crowded?

144
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,810
It must be because there are too few of them!

145
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,480
And where did Kosaku go to anyway?

146
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,230
Ah, you're Kazamatsuri-san!
 Why are you staggering around?

147
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,740
A-Ah, you're Kaga Kuniko-san from All Sports News.


148
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,490
What? You're going to propose to Yawara-chan?!

149
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,210
Are you really? Are you really? Kazamatsuri-san!

150
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,500
W-Wait, keep it down!

151
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,100
That's great to hear! Mm-hmm, it really is!

152
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,340
D-Do you think so?

153
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,050
I do! You don't love Sayaka-san, do you?

154
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,470
Huh? Uh, that's right.

155
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,810
You were only with her for the status, the prestige, and the money, right?

156
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,810
U-Uh, yeah, if you cut to the chase.


157
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:18,820
I really understand how you feel fettered and indecisive!

158
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,820
Right?!

159
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,120
But you've finally woken up after going astray for so long!


160
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,870
U-Uh, you didn't have to go that far.

161
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,340
Ah... love!

162
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,340
It's wonderful, it really is!

163
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,970
The pure love you have for Yawara-chan is simply beautiful!

164
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,680
Yeah, well...

165
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,440
Please make Yawara-chan happy.

166
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,070
Leave everything to me.

167
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,070
This way, everything will work out perfectly!

168
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,370
Oh.

169
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,950
I'll feel kind of sorry for Sayaka-san.

170
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,460
No, remember she can get anything she wants.

171
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,500
You're right about that!

172
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,900
Milady. It is almost time.

173
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,200

183
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,430
Hurry up!

184
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,060
What?

185
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,850
It's the Inokuma-Honami match!

186
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,890
What, it's already the championship match?


187
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,270
We have an announcement for all arena-goers:

188
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,320
Because we are at full capacity, we cannot allow further entry.

189
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,570
Are you kidding? Just pack us in like sardines!

190
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,240
Yeah!

191
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,820
We really are at full capacity!

192
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,530
No one else will be admitted! Please accept our apologies!

193
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,910
Inokuma-san is really fired up!



194
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,160
That's great form!

195
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,540
The time has finally arrived. How do you feel?

196
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,500
It's almost time for her match. Stop trying to talk to her!

197
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,720
Inokuma-san!

198
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,270
Your father, Honami's coach, hasn't been spotted here!

199
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,230
Do you have anything you'd like to say to your dad?


200
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,270
Of course, we'd really like to hear that!

201
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,320
S-Stop that! Her match is coming up!

202
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,660
Don't mess up her concentration!

203
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,870
Who are you to talk, All Sports ?

204
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,710
I thought your rag did nothing but scandal pieces!

205
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,420
Th-That's not the issue here!

206
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,800
All your paper does is print
 trumped-up stories, so back off!

207
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,170
What the hell do you mean, "trumped-up stories"?!

208
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,380
If you don't like it, then sell more copies!

209
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,050
What?

210
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,310
Quiet! She's preparing for her match!

211
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,520
See what you did? You made that baby cry again!

212
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,650
Why is it my fault?

213
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,270
Fuku-chan, it's almost time for beddy-bye!

214
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,240
Dad...

215
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,840
The final round is about to start.

216
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,500
Yeah.

217
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,550
Stay strong, Yawara.


218
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,270
I told Yawara something.

219
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,390
I said she needed to give it all she's got in this match.

220
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,610
And that if she held back,
 her father would never return home.

221
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,910
Miss Honami, the time has finally come to settle your feud.


222
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,040
Do you have anything to say before your fated showdown?

223
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,410
There it is!

224
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,670
So you're predicting a one-second Ippon win?

225
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,180
No. I will end the match within one minute.

226
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,180
One minute?

227
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,770
Let's go, Tokunaga!

228
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,440
Hey, w-wait!

229
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,360
Geez, where'd that come from?

230
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,530
It's not like that bombastic rich girl to predict a one-minute win.

231
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,870
I guess this is the one time she needs to walk back her swagger.

232
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,660
You did it, Sakata!

233
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,790
Coach Iwamoto!

234
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,460
Miss Sakata, congratulations on winning the 52 kg-and-under weight class!

235
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Now you're a proud member of the Barcelona Olympic team!

236
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,920
Coach!





237
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,850
Hey! Honami's entered the arena!

238
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,930
What?

239
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,800
Holy mackerel! I'd better see the 48 kg-and-unders final!

240
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,640
Hey...

241
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,890
Coach!

242
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,400
Outta my way!

243
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,200
My fated rival's match is finally starting.

244
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,910
It's just about time.

245
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,910
Right.

246
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,910
Okay, I'm off.

247
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,160
Fight out there, Inokuma!

248
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,920
Focus, Inokuma-san!

249
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,960
Sure!

250
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,380
I have to be quiet, or I'll wake Fuku-chan.

251
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,760
Yawara-chan!

252
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
Inokuma-san?

253
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,550
Stay strong!

254
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,680
Good luck, Inokuma-san!

255
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,060
You've got me in your corner!

256
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,350
We're having sushi at your victory party!

257
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,140
Right!

258
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,110
Give us a good match!

259
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,360
We're counting on you!

260
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,540
C'mon!

261
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,550
Keep dilly-dallying, and you'll lose by default again, mush-for-brains!

262
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,300
Fight hard, Inokuma-san!

263
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,550
Get fired up, Inokuma!

264
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,760
Did you hear? Honami predicted an Ippon in one minute!

265
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,390
Huh? That's pretty vanilla compared to her usual statements.



266
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,350
That doesn't really tell me she's been secretly training.

267
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,320
I guess it's because of Inokuma.

268
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,400
One minute?</i>

269
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,320
Why did that celebutante heiress say that?</i>

270
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,820
Matsuda-san?

271
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,580
That's Inokuma!

272
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,830
Inokuma's here!

273
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,830
Inokuma's entering the arena!

274
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,830
They're right! It's Inokuma!

275
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,930
What are you standing around for?!

276
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,020
Miss Sayaka's waited danged near forever for you!

277
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,650
Listen up, Yawara!

278
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,400
If you do that namby-pamby judo of yours,

279
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,030
I'm gonna thoroughly beat some character into you, so you'd best be prepared!

280
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,620
There ain't no pity in competitive sports, even if you are playing your daddy!

281
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,000
You get me?



282
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,460
If you do, then get out there and throw Miss Sayaka on her back!

283
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,170
Okay!

284
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,300
Hey, Kamoda!

285
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,720
Ah, Matsuda-san!

286
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,050
Don't worry. I'll get you tomorrow's front spread!

287
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,600
N-Never mind that! Where's Kaga-kun?!

288
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,390
Oh, Kuniko-san?

289
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,400
If that's who you're after, look, she's over there.

290
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,820
Or at least she was.

291
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,530
Did she need another bathroom break?

292
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,820
God! What is she doing?!

293
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,820
Relax. Just leave it to me!

294
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,290
There are now only two competitors left at the Women's All-Japan Selected Championships!

295
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:56,590
The whole country is expecting big things in this fated 48 kg-and-under championship match

296
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,800
between Inokuma Yawara and Honami Sayaka!



297
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,720
To date, there has been no one in Japanese women's judo...

298
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,970
no, in world women's judo,
 who can take on Honami Sayaka!

299
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,810
Will she rebound from her previous loss to Inokuma and take the throne as the true queen?

300
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,730
Or will Inokuma Yawara, who is still effectively undefeated,

301
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,820
come back from a year-long absence and stand atop the summit of women's judo once again?




302
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,950
The referees bow and take their positions.

303
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,790
The spectators in the arena are waiting impatiently for the big moment!

304
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,840
Yawara-chan!

305
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,340
This is Yoyogi 2nd National Gymnasium, and the crowd is going wild!



306
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,890
In white, Seishin Women's School's Honami Sayaka!

307
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,350
In red, Tsurukame Travel's Inokuma Yawara!

308
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,730
In women's judo, these two players are equally popular and talented,

309
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,900
and now they're fighting for the right to be on the Barcelona Olympic team!

310
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,830
Farewell, Sayaka-san.

311
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,830
Farewell, status and prestige.

312
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,960
I'll be true to my love for Yawara-san.

313
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,420
The two players approach the starting line!

314
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,550
Tamao.

315
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,180
If Yawara happens to lose,

316
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,100
despise me.




317
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,810
No.

318
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,100
That's just a part of competition.

319
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,650
Hey, what are you doing?!

320
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,320
Ah, Kosaku! The bathrooms were crowded!

321
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,030
Who cares about that!

322
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,540
You said you saw Sayaka's secret training, right?

323
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,170
Oh, that? I thought I already told you!

324
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,000
Sayaka-san was just having sex with Kazamatsuri-san!

325
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,840
Yeah, that! Give me more details!

326
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,680
Oh, my gosh, Kosaku! Give you more details? You dirty boy!

327
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,260
You're wrong! Besides, this isn't the time to say that!



328
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:18,140
Well, they were both on the floor grappling, hugging, and doing other stuff to each other.

329
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,360
Oh, my gosh! I can't say any more!

330
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,070
Oh, Kosaku, you're such a dirty little boy!

331
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,200
Huh? Wh-What is it?

332
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,160
I see. So that's what they were doing?

333
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,080
O-Oh crap!


334
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,790
H-Hey, wait!

335
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,660
Hold that match!

336
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,000
Kosaku, what is it?!

337
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,000
The match is finally about to begin!

338
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,970
Hajime!

339
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:59,980
The Gentle Way Is Not Built in a Day –Jigoro

340
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,900
Yawara! Right there! Get her!

341
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,400
I can't!

342
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,950
Dad, I can't do it!

343
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,700
You airhead! Why are you lazing about?! Take this match seriously!

344
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,910
Matsuda-san, I...

345
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,620
We're coming to the big climax of the decisive final battle!

346
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,420
Yawara!

347
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,080
Death Match!

348
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,370
You'll be getting my Tomoe Nage if you miss this!

349
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,920
Death Match!
