00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,030
Presented by FroZen-EviL!

3
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,710
Listen up, Yawara!

4
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,460
If you do that namby-pamby judo of yours,

5
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,130
I'm gonna thoroughly beat some character into you, so you'd best be prepared!

6
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,760
There ain't no pity in competitive sports, even if you are playing your daddy!

7
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,140
You get me?

8
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,770
If you do, then get out there and throw Miss Sayaka on her back!

9
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,440
Okay!

10
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,270
There are now only two competitors left at the Women's All-Japan Selected Championships!

11
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,320
The whole country is expecting big things in this fated 48 kg-and-under championship match

12
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,660
between Inokuma Yawara and Honami Sayaka!

13
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,620
To date, there has been no one in Japanese women's judo...

14
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,130
no, in world women's judo,
 who can take on Honami Sayaka!

15
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,960
Will she rebound from her previous loss to Inokuma and take the throne as the true queen?

16
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,880
Or will Inokuma Yawara, who is still effectively undefeated,

17
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,970
come back from a year-long absence and stand atop the summit of women's judo once again?

18
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,570
The referees bow and take their positions.

19
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,780
The spectators in the arena are waiting impatiently for the big moment!

20
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,280
In white, Seishin Women's School's Honami Sayaka!

21
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,290
In red, Tsurukame Travel's Inokuma Yawara!

22
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,500
In women's judo, these two players are equally popular and talented,

23
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,300
and now they're fighting for the right to be on the Barcelona Olympic team!

24
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,430
Farewell, Sayaka-san.

25
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,720
Farewell, status and prestige.

26
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,230
I'll be true to my love for Yawara-san.

27
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,730
The two players approach the starting line!

28
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,770
Tamao.

29
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,870
If Yawara happens to lose,

30
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,950
despise me.

31
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,080
No.

32
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,500
That's just a part of competition.

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,010
You said you saw Sayaka's secret training, right?

34
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,970
Oh, that? I thought I already told you!

35
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,510
Sayaka-san was just having sex with Kazamatsuri-san!

36
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,640
Yeah, that! Give me more details!

37
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,190
Oh, my gosh, Kosaku! Give you more details? You dirty boy!

38
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:21,070
Well, they were both on the floor grappling, hugging, and doing other stuff to each other.

39
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,530
Oh, my gosh! I can't say any more!

40
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,660
Oh, Kosaku, you're such a dirty little boy!

41
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,580
Huh? Wh-What is it?

42
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,620
I see. So that's what they were doing?

43
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,960
O-Oh crap!

44
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,210
H-Hey, wait!

45
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,420
Hold that match!

46
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,220
Kosaku, what is it?!

47
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,760
The match is finally about to begin!

48
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,690
Hajime!













49
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:06,740
Death Match

50
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,250
This is it, the opening salvos of the main event, the 48kg title match!

51
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,210
Who will win the spot on the Barcelona Olympic team?

52
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,210
Oh... Oh, my God!


53
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,720
I've got it! I know what Honami Sayaka's trying to pull!

54
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,300
Inokuma-san, fight hard!

55
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,180
Go get her!



56
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,770
Put her down, Yawara-chan!

57
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,770
Barcelona!

58
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,140
Barcelona!

59
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,490
Both players grapple fiercely for the upper hand!

60
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,200
But neither is giving an inch!

61
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,200
I have made my peace.

62
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,740
Win. Defeat her, Sayaka-san.

63
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,250
Dammit! It started!

64
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,210
They've grabbed each other! Inokuma's got a good hold!

65
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,590
She's in great position!

66
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,260
Now git!

67
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Inokuma's Kouchi Gari! Honami escapes!

68
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Inokuma shoulder-throws!

69
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,770
But Honami locks her legs and holds on!

70
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,190
Inokuma switches position and makes a quick foot sweep!

71
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,570
Yawara-san's maneuvering very well!

72
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,150
Outta the way!

73
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,950
Hey!

74
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,820
Out of my way!

75
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,410
Inokuma goes for another Ippon Zeoi!

76
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,240
Honami shifts to the right and shakes it off!

77
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,700
But Inokuma's quick! Her moves come in a blink of an eye!

78
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,670
Honami's doing all she can to avoid her!

79
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,540
Keep it up, Yawara!

80
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,170
Come on, let me through!

81
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,670
Inokuma with an Ouchi Gari!

82
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,140
Honami escapes but is completely harried!

83
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,760
You've got a chance, Inokuma-san!

84
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,640
Get her!

85
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,140
Watch out, Yawara-san!

86
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,230
Honami comes with a Tomoe Nage!

87
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,980
Who cares? We knew she'd use that!

88
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,070
Great, she fended it off!

89
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,610
No, wait!

90
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,110
Get outta there, Yawara-san!

91
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
You're mine!

92
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,620
Osaekomi!

93
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,620
Honami gets an Osaekomi! And it's a Kata Gatame!

94
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,630
No way!

95
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,130
Sayaka's secret training was in Newazas!

96
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,890
Wh-What just happened?





97
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,390
You dumb cluck! Didn't you notice the heiress grabbing at your collar

98
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,060
when you failed to get that Ippon Zeoi? She was trying to pin you!



99
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,560
That was masterly, Sayaka-san.

100
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,070
Ten seconds in! It's a Koka!

101
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,190
If Honami keeps her down for 30 seconds, she gets an Ippon win!

102
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,570
Inokuma's struggling for dear life!

103
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,110
Oh, now I get it!

104
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,080
That Tomoe Nage Honami Sayaka revealed at the All-Japan was not her special move!

105
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,870
Did you see how expertly she trapped Yawara into that Newaza?

106
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,090
That Tomoe Nage was merely a tool to get her into that pin!

107
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,130
Inokuma-san!

108
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,090
Inokuma!

109
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,010
Fifteen seconds in!





110
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,100
Will she win?! Has she secured her victory?!

111
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,060
Turn it around, Yawara-san! Turn it around!

112
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,810
Oh, Inokuma flips herself around!

113
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,320
She ain't outta the woods yet.

114
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,530
Whoa! Honami quickly does a stranglehold!

115
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,830
Everything you do is superb, Sayaka-san.

116
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,830
Is this it? Will Inokuma give up?

117
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,290
Hold on, Inokuma-san!

118
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,340
Please, tough it out!

119
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,380
Mate!

120
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,220
The ref stops the match.

121
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,340
Inokuma has hung on for dear life and avoided defeat!

122
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,110
It's a death trap! Honami's Newaza attack is a veritable death trap!

123
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,730
This is what Honami was secretly training for!

124
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,070
She has perfected her Newaza pins!

125
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,530
Yawara...

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,250
The match starts up again! Honami's Osaekomi gave her a one Koka lead!

127
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,470
How will Inokuma stand up against Honami's Newazas?!

128
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,970
Will she even get a chance to do her Ippon Zeoi?!




129
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,140
No, judging from Honami's movements from the beginning of the match,

130
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,430
she's guarding heavily against Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi!



131
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,810
Also, no matter how they grapple,

132
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,730
Honami is looking to topple Inokuma and put her into a Newaza!

133
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,780
Oh! Honami lifts her up by force!

134
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
Hold on!

135
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,330
Too fast! Honami goes for another Osaekomi!

136
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,080
Excellent.



137
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,590
Inokuma grabs her leg! But Honami is trying to pull it out!

138
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,470
Yawara-chan, get out of there!

139
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,590
Oh, my God!

140
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,140
If she frees her leg, it's an Osaekomi! Inokuma hangs on desperately!

141
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,640
This match is Honami's to lose!

142
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,350
Inokuma's in critical danger!

Are we sure we should've made this sign?

152
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,120
Is Miss Sayaka even going to win? She's facing Inokuma Yawara.

153
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:57,130
Well, it's no big deal to the Honamis
 if they cancel a 270 million yen party,

154
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,090
but to see all my hard work setting this up go "poof"...

155
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,640
Manager!

156
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,430
Wh-What is it? Did she lose?


157
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,980
There's still a long way to go,
 but Miss Honami Sayaka is leading by far!

158
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,820
She's got Inokuma Yawara on the ropes with her series of Newazas!

159
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,860
R-Really?!

160
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,870
Sign: Honami Sayaka's Championship Victory Party#

161
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,870
All right, let's get this place ready! Move it before the party starts!

162
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,370
Honami's trying to free her leg!
 Inokuma's in trouble!

163
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,690
She's good! Honami's better than good!

164
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,340
She's really practiced her Newazas!

165
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,850
She's perfected every single way she could get a pin!




166
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,850
Whoa! Inokuma tosses off Honami!

167
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,230
Yes, good!

168
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,730
But Honami quickly grabs an arm!

169
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,730
And she pulls her down!

170
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,900
Inokuma flips over and escapes!

171
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,410
But Honami grabs her neck and topples her backwards!

172
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,660
Inokuma just barely resists it!
 Honami goes for yet another Newaza!

173
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,380
Mate!

174
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,380
There's a Mate, and the match is paused!

175
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,130
This is agonizing!

176
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,180
I forgot to breathe!

177
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,100
Who'd have thought the match would go like this?


178
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,980
Honami won over her fans with her stunning standing techniques.

179
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,860
Now she's abandoned that strategy and is going for pins, regardless of appearances!

180
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,280
The still undefeated Inokuma can't do her Ippon Zeoi,

181
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,180
and is doing all she can to avoid Honami's Newaza death trap!

182
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,670
Who would've imagined seeing Honami or Inokuma as they are now?






183
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,540
I-It's all right. Yawara is a strong girl!

184
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,090
Yawara is certainly strong.

185
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,510
When it comes to standing techniques,

186
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,220
she's over 500 percent stronger than any other top contender.

187
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,140
But when it comes to Newazas,
 she's only 300 percent stronger.

188
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,440
Accordingly, Honami chose a game plan that gives her the best chance of winning.


189
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,240
This has been completely Honami's match as we go past the two-minute mark!

190
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,780
Inokuma must do something to break through Honami's techniques!

191
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,540
Inokuma-san, remember your own judo!

192
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
Fight her!

193
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,340
Why's that dolt lazing around?!

194
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,840
Inokuma grabs hold! She's going for a shoulder throw!

195
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,010
Oh, but Honami breaks the hold!

196
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,520
But Inokuma's fast! She's going for an Ouchi Gari!

197
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,230
Koka!

198
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,730
Inokuma gets a tying Koka!

199
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,730
Yes! Oh—

200
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,570
Oh, this time it's Inokuma going for an Osaekomi!

201
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,610
Inokuma's taking on Honami's Newaza challenge!

202
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,950
Inokuma's also known for her effective Newazas.

203
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,080
The reason why she escaped Honami's Newazas is because she's so good at them!

204
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,120
Inokuma-san, keep it up!

205
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,750
Tighten your hold!

206
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,420
Honami struggles with all she has!

207
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,300
Oh! Honami attacks from the supine position!

208
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,010
She's using her legs to pull Inokuma down!

209
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,730
A Jyuji Gatame! Honami's going for a Jyuji Gatame!

210
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,730
Inokuma resists!






211
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,110
If Honami pulls back her arm, it's all over!

212
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,280
Hold on!

213
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,620
Stop!

214
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,240
Leave her alone!

215
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,740
Don't let her!

216
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,750
Will she get it? Will Honami get her ticket to Barcelona?!

217
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,250
Sign: Sushi-Sei#

218
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,590
Aw, man!

219
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,170
H-Hold on. Stop rolling!

220
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,630
It doesn't look like Yawara-chan's getting her victory party!

221
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,260
B-But we already made this much!

222
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,100
But Yawara-chan isn't—

223
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,060
Keep rolling them, Sushi-Sei!

224
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,230
I'm adding 50 more servings to that order!

225
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,060
That'll make 200!



226
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,900
You won't make it for her victory party if you keep dawdling!

227
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,450
So keep rolling those sushi like there's no tomorrow!

228
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,660
Y-Yes, sir!

229
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,740
Are you two eating sushi at Yawara's victory party?

230
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,540
Y-Yes!

231
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,120
Wait, this isn't the time for...

232
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,340
Honami now has her Jyuji Gatame!

233
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,010
It's certain death for Inokuma!

234
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,800
Inokuma-san!



235
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,550
She's got it.

236
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,760
Is she done? Is Inokuma going to cry uncle?

237
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,060
Will Honami be on the Barcelona Olympic team?

238
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,060
Yawara-san, break it! Get out of that hold!

239
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:14,070
Congratulations, Sayaka-san.
 You've now obtained everything you wanted.

240
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,070
Except for me.

241
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,080
N-No! Yawara-chan can't lose!

242
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,620
There's no hope for her.

243
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,580
H-Huh?

244
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,590
Oh! Inokuma's trying to free her head!
 But Honami won't let her!

245
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,550
Inokuma-san isn't... She isn't giving up!

246
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,060
Will Inokuma break free? Will she?!

247
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,060
Mate!

248
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,070
She's free! Inokuma made her escape from Honami's Jyuji Gatame!

249
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,570
All right!

250
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,370
Inokuma-san! You're really amazing!

251
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,580
What guts!

252
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,080
Nice!

253
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,590
Inokuma!


254
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,090
Huh? Something's wrong with Inokuma.

255
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,300
It looks like that Jyuji Gatame hurt her arm!

256
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,560
Hmph, only 'cause she let herself get caught by that weak Newaza!

257
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,890
This isn't good.

258
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,560
If that pain is indeed too much, Inokuma will find herself with bigger problems.

259
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,070
Yawara-san.

260
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,320
Hajime!

261
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,490
Only one minute left in the match!

262
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,330
Laugh or cry, everything comes down to this last minute!

263
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,260
Honami's avoiding Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi as she fends off her left hand!



264
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,180
But take a look, folks. Inokuma's right arm appears to be failing her!

265
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,550
Th-This is bad news!

266
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,230
My special boiled toad ointment would take care of that in a jiffy!

267
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,400
Th-That's not the problem here.



268
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,400
Yawara can do an Ippon Zeoi as long as she can use her left hand.

269
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,660
But Honami is fending off Yawara's left hand completely!

270
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,410
If her right arm is useless, and she can't get a hold with her left hand, she's basically stuck!

271
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,370
There's always her legs if she can't use her arms!

272
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,910
What?!




273
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,210
Oh! Inokuma desperately grabs Honami's collar with her left hand!

274
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,920
Her right arm's only pressed lightly against her!

275
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,630
Inokuma-san!

276
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,920
What is this?!

277
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,430
Crap!

278
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,390
This is a chance for Honami!

279
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,350
See, Yawara's got something up her sleeve!

280
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,220
Now!

281
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,650
Oh! Yawara tried to do something but hesitated!

282
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,150
Honami takes advantage of that pause with an Ashi Barai!

283
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,900
Inokuma holds on!

284
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,910
Honami with her Tomoe Nage!

285
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,200
Inokuma stops it with her injured right arm. That's gotta hurt!

286
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,250
Wait, Honami goes for another Newaza but Inokuma escapes!



287
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,330
Honami gives chase, Inokuma evades!
 Honami gives chase, Inokuma evades!

288
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,340
Mate!

289
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,880
It's a death match!

290
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,840
They're using every last drop of their strength in this death match!

291
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,050
Hang in there, Yawara! Just one more push!

292
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,930
Why did you hesitate?

293
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,560
This is a serious fight, Yawara.

294
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,070
That airhead! Why'd she decide to go weak-kneed now, of all times?!

295
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,440
That heiress nearly broke your arm off, remember?




296
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,070
Don't show no mercy, you yutz!

297
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,080
Dad... I...</i>

298
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,580
I... can't do it.</i>

299
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,550
Six years.

300
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,220
That short span of time has lasted far too long, Inokuma-san.

301
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,310
I will soon settle this and put an end to our acquaintanceship.

302
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,980
I wish you the best, Inokuma Yawara-san.

303
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,150
Hajime!

304
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,150
What will you do, Inokuma? Only thirty seconds left!

305
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,900
Honami will definitely win the judges' decision if it ends like this!

306
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,160
I can't!</i>

307
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,070
I can't do it!</i>

308
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,160
Dad!</i>

309
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Win, Yawara-san!

310
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Matsuda-san?</i>

311
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,660
Win and go to Barcelona!

312
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,040
Get the Olympic gold medal!

313
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,550
Don't take away my dream!



314
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,670
Matsuda-san?</i>

315
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,890
Inokuma grabs Honami's collar with her left hand!

316
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,970
Her right arm's only along for the ride!

317
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,140
This is a chance for Honami! Will she end it with a final Newaza?

318
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,110
Matsuda-san!</i>

319
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,650
Yawara-san!

320
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,150
Matsuda-san!</i>

321
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,650
There! Get her!

322
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,410
Inokuma goes for a Tomoe Nage!

323
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
Yuko!

324
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,790
Yuko! Inokuma's Tomoe Nage earns her a Yuko!

325
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,670
Oh, Inokuma now goes for her own Newaza!

326
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,290
Honami desperately, desperately tries to escape!

327
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,800
Only twenty seconds left. She's out of time!

328
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Honami evades!

329
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,300
Mate!

330
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,050
It's a Mate. Honami barely gets away!

331
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,890
Inokuma-san, you're fantastic!

332
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,520
It's all but yours!

333
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,850
Yawara!

334
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,020
Barcelona!

335
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,520
All right! We've our front-page spread:
 Inokuma Yawara's Tenacious Tomoe Nage!

336
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,020
Impossible...

337
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,530
Yawara!




338
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,530
Good job getting over it.

339
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,580
Still, what a shocker. Who'd have believed Inokuma would pull a Tomoe Nage?

340
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,290
Indeed, it was magnificent.

341
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,080
She made up for the injury Honami inflicted on her right arm

342
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
by perfectly timing her kick in that Tomoe Nage!

343
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
Inokuma's simply amazing!




344
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,010
She gets a danged Yuko all 'cause she got cold feet the first time!

345
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,970
Y-You're right. She did hesitate that one time.

346
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,970
She used that Tomoe Nage against her dad when she was five.

347
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,270
Huh?

348
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,980
She beat her dad with that move?

349
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,440
She was afraid of using the Tomoe Nage because her old man is Miss Sayaka's coach.

350
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,070
The way she's still wrapped up in the past tells me she's too danged soft!

351
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,990
There ain't no mercy in competition!

352
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,740
Father!

353
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,990
Still, the fact she used that move means she's gotten past everything.

354
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,000
The match is not over by a long shot, Yawara.

355
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,460
The real fight begins now.

356
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:59,980
The Gentle Way Is Not Built in a Day –Jigoro

357
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,940
Yawara!

358
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,190
You even think about winning on points, I ain't taking you to Barcelona!

359
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,150
Get an Ippon!

360
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,620
Get an Ippon, win, and settle with that heiress once and for all!

361
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,910
Matsuda-san! If Matsuda-san weren't there cheering for me, I would never have...

362
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,910
Yawara! This is your last episode!

363
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,670
Ever Since I Met You...

364
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,250
You'll be getting my Sankaku Jime, my Hadaka Jime,

365
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,800
and the ultimate Ippon Zeoi if you miss this!

366
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Ever Since I Met You...
