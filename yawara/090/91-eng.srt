1
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,780
Ippon!

2
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,360
There it is! Her Ippon Zeoi!

3
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Inokuma Yawara wins the gold medal!

4
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,390
The final match of the Judo World Championships...

5
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,930
No matter how many times I watch it, I still get excited.

6
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,550
Yes, it's very exciting.

7
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,170
But we still haven't gotten her grandfather's consent.



8
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,120
Maybe we were dreaming when we thought we'd get Inokuma Yawara.

9
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,100
I've made up my mind!

10
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,660
As the company president, I will personally go and convince her grandfather!



11
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,720
Will it work out, though?

12
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,360
That grandfather of hers is more bullheaded than you can imagine.

13
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,760
What are you saying?!

14
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm an economic pillar of this country!

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,630
Arguing down one old man will be child's play for me!

16
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,590
Anyway, leave everything to me!

17
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:42,640
Next Up,
 The Graduation Match!

18
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,640
Please hear me out!

19
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,930
These chestnut jelly bars are something else.

20
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,000
You like them?

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,280
A little too squishy though.

22
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,660
We're very sorry!

23
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,110
Do you prefer spirits instead?

24
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,830
I'm not talking about these bars. I'm talking about you people!

25
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,060
Tsurukame Travel, Monkey Crab Travel, or whatever you are.


26
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,080
I hear that you people don't even have a company judo team.

27
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh, about that,

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,140
as we've said before, we're planning to construct a top-of-the-line dojo.



29
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,590
We're also planning to bring in the best coaches.

30
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,550
Don't take judo so lightly!

31
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,140
Judo is not that easy.

32
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,600
Take this book and learn from it.
 It's even got my autograph.
Book: The Gentle Way Is Not Built in a Day
By Inokuma Jigoro#

33
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,760
I will read it most gratefully.

34
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,070
There's also one more thing that's bothering me.

35
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,930
What might that be?

36
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,620
If you wanted Yawara so badly, why weren't you first in line?

37
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,990
You sure took your sweet time getting here.

38
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,120
W-We called here numerous times, but youâ€”

39
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,250
Don't say anything rash, you nitwit!

40
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,080
We might not be the first ones to ask,

41
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,960
but we're first in eagerness!


42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,970
But... if we'd been the first to come, would you have allowed her to join our company?

43
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,470
But you're not getting her!

44
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,690
I admire your enthusiasm, but Yawara's gonna transfer to Saikai University!



45
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,430
That bastard!

46
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,940
Acting like a jackass when I groveled to him.

47
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,660
Who'd have believed such an eccentric, grumpy, obstinate old codger could even exist?

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,460
Sir, are we giving up on Inokuma Yawara?

49
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,910
We have no other choice!


50
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,020
There's no way we can convince her grandfather!

51
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,130
So getting her was just a dream?

52
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,840
I still can't believe he raised Yawara-san, let alone that she's his granddaughter.

53
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,350
Yeah.


54
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,940
I thank God she doesn't take after that grandfather of hers.

55
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,360
There's nothing like a sale!

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,650
You always go overboard with these sales, Fujiko-san!

57
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,510
Come on! You know I'm up every day writing my thesis,

58
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,000
and then there's judo training at Saikai University.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,830
I really need to let off some steam.

60
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,410
The training at Saikai University is tough, isn't it?

61
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,640
"Tough" doesn't even begin to describe it.


62
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,840
I hope you'll hurry and come join me.

63
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,500
But I suppose that kind of training would be no sweat to you.

64
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,840
Fujiko-san.

65
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,850
Listen, I...


66
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,590
So then, Master, you've taken care of Yawara-san's job search, I hope?

67
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,200
Yes. I've made all her potential employers give up.

68
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,690
Is that right?

69
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,050
After the World Judo Championships,

70
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,890
the media have been speculating about her next career move.

71
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,910
It wasn't just Yawara. I've also been making my rounds on TV!

72
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,550
I've seen it!



73
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,340
Especially the time you appeared on that advice show.

74
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,930
Your words moved me!

75
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,520
The way to spousalhood is not built in a day!

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,980

Wow!

77
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,310
Sign: Omoikkiri Wide
 (a pun on the shows "Omoikkiri TV" and "The Wide")#

78
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,940
How those words rang true!

79
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,840
When you've lived a turtle's age, you pick up a few things.

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,910
What are you saying, Master? You're still a spring chicken!

81
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,980
HAHAHAHA!#

82
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,870
Come on, have some sushi! Go on!

83
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,700
Speaking of turtles,

84
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,210
some people calling themselves "Mud Turtle Travel" came by this morning.

85
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,850
"Mud Turtle"? Never heard of them.

86
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,940
If you turn your back, you'll find all sorts of funny characters gunning for Yawara.

87
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,060
Understood.



88
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,520
Let's hurry and get Yawara-san officially transferred to Saikai University.

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,190
Finally, my two-year aspiration will be realized!

90
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,650
There's still one obstacle to making that happen.


91
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,420
In fact, Yawara's still running around behind our backs trying to get a job.

92
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,160
I swear. Where does she get her obstinate eccentricity from?

93
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,800
W-Will it work out?

94
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,380
We won't get another sudden plot reversal, like when she enrolled at MWJC?

95
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,360
I ain't letting that happen!



96
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,030
I still have a trick or two up my sleeve. Good things come to those who wait.

97
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,390
R-Right...

98
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,480
I see.


99
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,690
You chose that travel agency, Tsurukame Travel, in order to search for your father.

100
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,400
You don't need to apologize.
 You should've told me sooner.

102
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,410
But you were looking forward to going to Saikai University with me.

103
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,200
Well, I would've enjoyed continuing to play judo with you.



104
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,250
But if I ever need pointers on judo, I can always come to you.

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,930
Cheer up! I'm sure you'll find your father.

106
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,720
Fujiko-san.



107
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,720
I'll do my best at Saikai U, and so should you,

108
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,230
at Tsurukame Travel.

109
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,720
Fujiko-san!

110
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,070
And you know Matsuda-san is also on your side.

111
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,110
H-He's not the issue here!

112
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,780
Oh, there she goes again!

113
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,070
But...

114
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,790
I still have a problem with Grandpa.

115
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,040
I don't think he's going to let me work for them.

116
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,080
Let me handle it!

117
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,210
I'll go with you, and we'll convince him together!

118
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,860
Thank you!

119
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,320
But I wonder if Grandpa is even capable of hearing someone out.

120
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,780
Me too.

121
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,180
Right?


122
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,980
Yoo-hoo, sorry to keep you waiting!

123
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,230
Why the long faces?

124
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,150
We've been talking about how sad it is that we're going to graduate soon.

125
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,070
In that case, let's have a bash!

126
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,200
How about we invite some guys and have a graduation mixer?

127
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,240
Hell, no. I've had my fill of men.

128
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,390
Then what about a trip?

129
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,860
We can go to Hawaii or Australia.

130
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,270
It's kinda late to make reservations, isn't it?

131
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,110
Besides, everyone's busy with internships and stuff.



132
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,550
You haven't found a job yet, so you're an exception.

133
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,220
But because we had a close judo circle,
 I'd like to do something.

134
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,100
Don't tell me you want to hold a
 graduation match or something?

135
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,840
Why are you looking at me like that?


136
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,900
Do I look that hot?

137
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,990
Marilyn, you might've hit on a great idea!

138
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,650
What idea?

139
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,530
A graduation match!

140
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,540
God, no! I'll get all sweaty and gross again!

141
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,200
Hey, why not?!

142
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,960
We've all learned to play judo,
 but we've only been in two matches!

143
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,840
I've also been gaining weight while concentrating on my thesis!

144
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,760
I don't want to! I'll get bruised up again!

145
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,260
What are you saying? We're still the top women's team in the country!

146
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,480
The media will fall all over themselves covering this match!

147
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,520
The media? Then I guess I'll think about it.

148
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,440
Okay, it's settled!


149
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,980
Now let's get things started!

150
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,980
What? A graduation match?

151
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,730
Yes. That's why we want you as our coach again.

152
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,040
We also want you to find us an opponent.


153
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,620
It doesn't matter who we're up against, because we have Yawara-chan.

154
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,250
In any case, we want to go out with a bang.

155
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,650
Very good!

156
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,720
I wish that judo-shirking, "I'm going job hunting" Yawara

157
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,720
had a fingernail's worth of the dedication you girls show.

158
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,850
Job hunting?

159
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,680
Isn't Inokuma-san going to Saikai U?

160
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,680
Of course she's going. I'll make it happen.




161
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,030
But back to this graduation match. I see what you're saying.

162
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,720
See? Good things do come to those who wait.</i>

163
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,810
A graduation match?

164
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,400
That's good. That's very good.

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Leave everything about this match to me, including the opponents.

166
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,970
Sign: All Sports News#


167
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,230
MWJC is having a graduation match?!

168
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,110
That's perfect! It'll make a great article!

169
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,110
But we still have a tiny little problem.

170
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,390
We need an opponent willing to take on Yawara, the reigning champion.

171
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,060
You think any of the Mickey Mouse teams we have around here would fit the bill?

172
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,910
Y-Yeah, you're right.

173
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:18,010
If I don't find a <i>real</i> good opponent,
 I might be forced to cancel the match.

174
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,840
W-Wait, please!

175
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,880
Leave that to me!



176
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,990
I'll do anything just to see
 Yawara-san in another match!

177
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,930
I'll be sure to find that <i>real</i> good team!

178
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,810
Oh, will you now? Then I'm counting on you.

179
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,110
Hey, hey! What gives?!

180
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,610
Are you learning folk dancing at Saikai U?

181
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,370
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

182
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,900
You're pulling too weakly with your left!

183
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,070
That's still amazing!

184
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,630
Fujiko-san, I think you've gotten even stronger
than you were in the World Championships!


185
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,090
She still ain't nearly good enough to take you on, Yawara.

186
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,610
Oh, forget what I said.

187
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,410
Let's call it a day, okay?

188
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,350
Thank you very much!

189
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,100
E-Excuse me, Master!



190
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,460
Actually, I didn't come here today just to train.

191
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,960
Then what? You want to eat something?

192
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,620
Um... well, you see...

193
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,410
It's about Yawara-san's employment.

194
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,540
Can you let her work?

195
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,950
It's okay, Fujiko-san.

196
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,100
Grandpa won't understand, no matter what you say.

197
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,760
I beg you, Master!

198
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,550
Please allow Inokuma-san to work at Tsurukame Travel!

199
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,620
Tsurukame?

200
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,560
Was it "Tsurukame" or "Mud Turtle" Travel that came this morning?

201
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,000
This... morning?



202
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,020
What do you mean they came this morning?

203
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,330
They brought chestnut jelly bars.

204
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,640
They tasted pretty good.

205
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,460
I had no idea they had come by.

206
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,220
You hid that from me, didn't you?!
 What did you do?

207
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,750
They had the nerve to come even though they don't have a judo team.

208
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,410
So I told them to scram.

209
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,920
What's with that look?

210
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,930
Let's go, Fujiko-san!

211
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,260
B-But Inokuma-san!

212
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Now I'm mad!

213
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,100
He's always, always, <i>always</i> deciding my future for me!

214
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,670
Wait, Yawara!

215
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,190
Sit down here for a minute.

216
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,700
I won't!

217
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,690
Inokuma-san!



218
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,160
Hoo boy.

219
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,700
I simply don't understand why you'd wanna go to a third-rate travel company like them.

220
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,710
Well, you see, Masterâ€”

221
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,680
I don't need <i>you</i> to understand!

222
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,160
However, I'm not an ogre.

223
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:04,130
I also didn't go along with your decision to go to Miihaa Girls College. 
Note: Miihaa means fashionable girl.#

224
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,590
I argued that living a foolish life at a girls college would take its toll

225
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,720
on your body and soul and leave you unfit to play judo.

226
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,950
However, Yawara,

227
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:19,180
you still won the gold medals at the World Cup and the World Judo Championships.

228
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
When I ask myself why,




229
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,190
the answer is that even Miihaa has its share of decent people to support you.

230
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,690
Isn't that right, Beanpole?

231
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,750
And that includes those judo girls who swung by earlier.

232
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,410
Paddyfield and the others came here?

233
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,600
Those girls have a lot of heart, if I do say so myself.

234
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,630
Would you believe they came here and
 proposed a judo match for their graduation?

235
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,940
A match for their...

236
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,670
...graduation?

237
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,920
That's right!

238
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,240
That gaggle of good-for-nothings told me they wanted to play a match!




239
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,680
That made the scales fall from my eyes.

240
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,250
It's no longer sufficient if you merely join a strong judo team.

241
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,580
If you can all hone each other's skills, just like at that worthless Miihaa Girls College,

242
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,150
you and the others will become stronger.

243
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,680
I... I...

244
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,620
I was painfully moved!

245
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,990
Grandpa...



246
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,140
That's when I made my decision.

247
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,700
If the MWJC team wins the graduation match,

248
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,350
you can go to Mud Turtle Travel, Monkey Crab Travel, or wherever you want.

249
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,100
Really, Grandpa?



250
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,890
A judoka is as good as his word!

251
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:49,310
If you win the match, it'll prove that you'll get stronger at judo wherever you go.

252
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,610
Thank you, Grandpa!

253
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,610
If you lose, we're beating you into shape at Saikai U.

254
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,080
Okay!

255
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,120
Master!

256
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,630
That's why we must win this upcoming match!


257
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,190
I see. Things have gotten serious.

258
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,390
This isn't a joke anymore, is it?

259
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,590
You actually thought the match was a joke?

260
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,880
I'm sorry, everyone.

261
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,090
This graduation match you all planned has taken a weird turn.

262
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,030
Relax, it's fine!


263
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,560
We're playing, no matter what we're fighting for!

264
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,370
But I had no idea that your father was missing, Inokuma-san.

265
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,400
Despite those difficult circumstances, you're still so strong and so cheerful.

266
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,050
You even encouraged me to do better.



267
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,580
On the other hand, I was raised in a comfortable environment.

268
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,590
I feel kind of ashamed.

269
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,570
Kyonkyon.

270
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,100
I am truly and deeply moved!

271
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,610
Everyone, let's make sure Inokuma goes to Sea Turtle Travel!

272
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,120
Yeah! We will win the match, and you'll work for Peeping Tom Travel!

273
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,570
Thank you, but it's Tsurukame Travel.

274
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,010
Anyway, leave everything to us!

275
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,450
I don't know if I'll be of any help, but I'll do my best!

276
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,620
Looks like I'll be shedding some weight.

277
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,500
Everyone...

278
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,090
Everyone!

279
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,060
Thank you!




280
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,600
With that settled, let's go practice!

281
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,300
Yeah!

282
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,860
Sign: Seine University of France
Women's Judo Training Camp#

283
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,860
I'm so happy to meet you, Master Jigoro!

284
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,700
Wh-Who the devil is this guy?

285
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,180
He's Coach Polnareff of France's Seine University.

286
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,120
He says he's your biggest fan.

287
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,870
Oh, then I'll give you my autograph.

288
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,640
Merci!

289
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,500
So these are all your star pupils?

290
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,380
Yes, oui-oui!

291
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,880
These are my raw pupils.
Note: He mispronounces "manadeshi" (favorite) as "namadeshi" (raw).#

292
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,590
This is great timing!

293
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,180
The Seine University judo team is actually holding their training camp here in Japan.

294
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,950
Look at the woman who made that throw!

295
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,400
That's Deneuve! She appeared in the World Judo Championships!

296
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,110
That's the European Judo Champion, MorÃ©chand!

297
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,370


298
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,010
I-I have to say, this is amazing.

299
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,550
Judo is popular in France, and Seine University is the top team!

300
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,630
What do you think of my raw pupils, Master Jigoro?

301
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,090
Are they <i>real</i> good?

302
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,750
I think he likes what he sees!

303
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,100
I like it! In fact I'm loving it!

304
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,400
I am honored!


305
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,200
Come on, what's going on?! Show some spirit!

306
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,570
One, two three, four.

307
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,950
Un, deux, trois!

308
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
Yes, that's the way!

309
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,900
What are you doing over here?

310
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,960
But I'm tired.

311
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,190
C-Can't you do something about the way you dress?

312
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,190
Don't you have a T-shirt or something?

313
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,010
Yuck, your nose is bleeding!

314
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,980
Oh, this place is buzzing.

315
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,250
Matsuda-san!

316
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,510
Oh, hi!

317
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,020
We found an opponent for you.

318
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,110
The opponent for your graduation match!

319
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,950
I went and found a team after Gramps asked me to.

320
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,140
You did?

321
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,830
This one puts the Tsukushi University team at the Ajisai Cup to shame.

322
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,760
It's not often you get to play against a team like this.

323
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,000
So, who is this opponent?

324
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,500
France's Seine University's women's judo team.



325
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,930
They have MorÃ©chand, the European Champion.

326
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,720
Put her together with Deneuve, the World Judo Championship third-place finisher,

327
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,130
and you have the best team in France!

328
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,400
The best...

329
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,070
...in France?

330
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,210
Isn't that great?



331
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,810
That's the only type of opponent worthy of Yawara-san!

332
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,820
Wh-What have you done?!

333
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,670
Yawara-chan's employment prospects are riding on this match!

334
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,910
E-Employment? What do you mean?

335
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:51,240
Master Jigoro said that if she wins the match, she can work for Tsurukame Travel.



336
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,640
We've made a firm decision to support Inokuma.

337
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,270
She wants to join Tsurukame Travel so that she can search for her father.

338
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,250
You're kidding.


339
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,750
We're not! What the hell were you thinking?!

340
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,800
I-I had no idea that the match meant so much.

341
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,740
If our opponent is that strong a team...

342
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,410
then Inokuma-san's chances of being hired...


343
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,310
The pieces are all in place.</i>

344
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,960
All that's left is for everything to go according to my detailed plan.</i>
