00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,860
This isn't...

3
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,450
a knockout competition?

4
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,030
We've been tricked.

5
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,200
This match is a plot devised entirely by...

6
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,210
Master Jigoro and Matsuda-san.

7
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,290
Now then, we will conduct the first match.

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,730
I'm sorry, everyone.

9
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,050
Because of me, what was supposed to be a fun graduation match...

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,300
Who cares anymore? Let's just have fun today.

11
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,730
Ippon!

12
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,580
Second players forward!

13
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,100
Y-You... You mean me?

14
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,230
Paddyfield?

15
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,400
Deneuve specializes in the Uchi Mata!

16
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
Please...

17
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,620
Please, win!

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,620
Matsuda-san?

19
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,590
Kyonkyon Risks Her Life!

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,290
Please win and let Yawara-san work at Tsurukame Travel!

21
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,600
Matsuda-san?



22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,070
Let Yawara-san go to Tsurukame Travel.

23
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,840
Really, now?

24
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,610
Yeah!

25
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,160
You conspired with Yawara-chan's grandpa so she'd go to Saikai U, didn't you?

26
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,640
I-I...

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,330
But...

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,880
weren't you the one who picked this really good team?

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,730
No, I—

30
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,840
You've really...
No, I—

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,380
stepped in it this time, Matsuda-san.

32
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,480
I only picked that strong French team because I wanted Yawara-san to have a good match!

33
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,350
I still think Yawara-san should go to Saikai U.



34
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,560
With the Barcelona Olympics coming up,

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,860
this is no time to be working for Tsurukame Travel!

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,360
Jet across the globe, Tsurukame Travel!

37
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,330
Not for Tsurukame Travel.

38
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,370
But I'd never stoop to Jigoro-san's level.

39
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,730
So because of that, you have my full support!

40
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,170
Even if you go to Tsurukame Travel!

41
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,930
However, winning this contest will be quite difficult.

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,440
All because of Matsuda-san.

43
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,290
We won't know unless we try!

44
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,000
They can use the data I have!

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,440
Oh, very impressive. What are you now, a spy?

46
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,430
Bye now!

47
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,300
Later.
Bye now!

48
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,810
Good working with you.

49
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,460
Man, that was quick.

50
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,370
We'd better hurry and rush these photos of Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi into print.

51
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,200
Wait!

52
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,460
I can't let you fellows go just yet.

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,910
But you know Seine U is going to win this.

54
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,470
We're busy here. Can't we call it a day?

55
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,120
Now, now, why don't you sit back, relax, and enjoy these snacks?

56
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,460
I predict my post-game press conference will give your notepads a good workout.

57
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,990
Second player for Mitsuba College!

58
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,740
Second player for Mitsuba College, Minamida!

59
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:09,820
Coming!

60
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
Hurry it up!


61
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,970
Try to relax, Paddyfield.

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,940
It's okay. Just have fun.

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,410
Listen, Deneuve specializes in the Uchi Mata!

64
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,520
Just watch out for her Uchi Mata!

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,350
I've practiced my Uchi Mata with you,
 so you know what to look for, Paddyfield!

66
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,810
After that, get her with your deadly Deashi Barai!

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,270
Minamida Yoko.

68
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,430
Everything hangs on her.

69
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,540
That's because we have the third player, Hikage Kyoko,

70
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,700
and the vice captain, Yoshinagawa Sayuri.

71
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,360
No matter what anyone thinks will happen or what surprises are in store,

72
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
those two aren't going to win.

73
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,210
And the captain, Fujiko-san, won't even get to make an appearance.

74
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,810
If the Mitsuba team loses three matches, they lose this contest.

75
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,930
You really blew it this time, Matsuda-san.

76
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,430
Go get her, Paddyfield!


77
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,930
Bow to each other!

78
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,710
Yes, bag another one, Inokuma-san!

79
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,480
S-Sir! That's not Inokuma Yawara!

80
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,500
I doesn't appear to be a knockout competition.

81
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,900
No need to worry, right?

82
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,910
I don't know.

83
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,990
Watch out, Deneuve!

84
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,020
She may be a white belt,
 but she's Master Jigoro's pupil!

85
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,130
Be ready for anything!

86
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,220
Hajime!

87
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,180
Don't fight her directly!

88
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,930
Don't let her grip a good spot!

89
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,420
I don't care if it's a Yuko or a Koka!

90
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,190
Just get those points and evade!

91
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
Trying to be clever, eh?

92
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,190
I always say, "If it ain't an Ippon, it ain't a win."

93
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,740
Oh, no! Her opponent's got her in a good position!

94
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,270
Please, at least tie!

95
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,620
Paddyfield!

96
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,480
Points and ties?

97
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,670
I don't remember teaching her that kinda judo.

98
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,470
I'm done!

99
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,440
Ippon! Done!

100
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,410
Looks like the end of the line.


101
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,410
They're really France's top-class team!

102
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,030
They actually go for Ippons, unlike some shady, two-bit team I could name.

103
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,090
Go ahead, eat!

104
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,420
Thanks.

105
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,410
H-Hey! It's now tied 1-1!

106
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,030
W-Will everything be all right?

107
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,430
Uh, yeah. Probably.

108
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm sorry, Yawara-chan!

109
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,120
I totally sucked out there!

110
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,030
It's okay, Paddyfield.

111
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,400
There's nothing you could do.
 She's ranked third in the world.

112
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,550
M-Matsuda-san, what about the next player?

113
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,790
Oh, yeah.

114
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,890
The third player, Mimieux, is in the 56kg-and-under weight class.

115
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,680
Her special move is a combination of Osoto Gari and Harai Goshi.

116
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,260
Even if we know that, how will it help?

117
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,770
Look at her.

118
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,280
Kyonkyon?

119
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,360
It's okay. You don't have to worry about me.

120
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,740
Just have fun at this graduation match!

121
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,770
Inokuma-san, I...





122
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,110
I've always had a weak body, and I was frequently absent from school.

123
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,590
When I did go to school, I'd get anemic during morning assemblies.

124
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,030
I always sat out during gym.

125
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,940
I never participated in any sports festivals or field trips,

126
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,440
because my parents and my teachers told me not to strain myself.

127
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,710
Whenever I stayed home from school,

128
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,940
time passed so slowly that it almost stopped.

129
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,990
It felt like the whole world was leaving me behind.






130
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,130
I lost so much willpower that at times I thought

131
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,700
I'd be on the outside looking in forever.

132
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,650
My dream was to become a children's caregiver,

133
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,980
but I thought it would never come true.

134
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,850
However, lately people have been telling me how healthy I look.

135
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,230
I haven't been feeling sick, and I'm actually enjoying the food I eat.

136
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,040
The dream that I had since I was a little girl...

137
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,200
may still be faint, but I think it will come true.

138
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,700
I'm glad, Kyonkyon.

139
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,500
Thank you, Inokuma-san.

140
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,330
It's thanks to judo.

141
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,710
It's all thanks to you, Inokuma-san.

142
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,180
We will now begin the third match!

143
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,340
If you'll excuse me, I'll be going.

144
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,470
Kyonkyon.

145
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,160
Kyonkyon! Your opponent specializes in the Osoto Gari! Don't fall for it!

146
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,950
You can just tie!

147
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,680
Hey, are you listening?!





148
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,610
Oh, no, she doesn't hear us!

149
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,690
Kyonkyon!

150
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,340
You should've put me in instead!

151
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,050
Oh, here comes that midget again.

152
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,710
Stick a fork in her.

153
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,500
Come on, let's get on with Inokuma's press conference!

154
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,430
Please!

155
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,440
Wh-What is that?

156
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,310
H-How is <i>she</i> supposed to win?!

157
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,400
I really don't see that happening.


158
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,820
"The flexible command the strong; the small command the large."

159
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,760
That's Master Jigoro's judo in the flesh!

160
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,410
Be careful, Mimieux!

161
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,420
These mooncakes are delectable!

162
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,450
Aren't they? I've heard good things about them.

163
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,640
You brought them?

164
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,520
Yeah.

165
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,970
Wow, these <i>are</i> good!

166
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,930
Bow to each other!


167
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,330
I have to pay her back.</i>

168
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,150
I have to send Inokuma-san to Tsurukame Travel</i>

169
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,940
so she can find her father!</i>

170
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,690
Oh, it's starting.

171
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,310
We all know how it'll turn out.

172
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,770
These are great!

173
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,660
Ain't they?

174
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,110
Hajime!

175
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,690
That shriek...

176
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,040
No way! Kyonkyon?

177
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,540
Kyonkyon?

178
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,550
One, two, three. One, two, three!

179
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,970
One, two, thr—

180
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,260
One, two, three!

181
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,060
She did it!

182
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,590
Kyonkyon's Deashi Barai!

183
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,590
Yuko!

184
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,850
What? That was a Waza Ari!

185
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,810
Kyonkyon, run!

186
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,970
If someone tries to pin you, turn into a turtle!

187
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,080
A turtle!

188
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,990
A tur—

189
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,620
Yes, that's good!

190
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,740
Hold out against her!

191
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,910
She lifted her up!

192
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,430
If someone lifts you up, flail about!

193
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,430
Flail!

194
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,380
Flail...

195
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,890
Jougai!

196
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,200
Mate!

197
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,110
That was close.

198
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,610
That was amazing, Kyonkyon!



199
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,120
Wow, color me surprised.

200
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,620
For a girl so small, that was a great Deashi Barai!


201
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,860
That's really something. You can see that Jigoro-san was her teacher.


202
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,590
You give superior instruction, Master!

203
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,300
Almost!

204
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,090
If she had kept her arms tighter by her sides, she would've had an Ippon!

205
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,940
You dolt! If she'd gotten an Ippon, our plans would be ruined!

206
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,230
O-Oh, you're right! But who am I supposed to cheer for now?

207
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,040
Master Jigoro's judo is a judo to fear.

208
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,190
"The flexible command the strong."

209
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,580
I have to win for Inokuma-san.</i>

210
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,200
I have to send her to Tsurukame Travel!</i>

211
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,380
One, two, three. One, two, three!



212
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,380
Kyonkyon, don't push your luck!

213
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,840
One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three!

214
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,510
You have the lead! Get away!

215
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,390
One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three!

216
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,350
Kyonkyon!

217
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,130
One, two, three!

218
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,220
That's another Deashi Barai!

219
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,990
But it was too weak!

220
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,070
Kyonkyon, turn into a turtle!

221
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,640
Yes, that's the way!

222
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,870
Don't let her turn you over!

223
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,880
Calm down, Mimieux!

224
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
Mate!

225
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,280
I'll be damned. She's doing real judo.

226
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,860
And that's <i>Kyonkyon</i>.

227
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,710
Kyonkyon...

228
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,000
Wait, this is no time to be impressed!

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,710
Kyonkyon, don't push your luck. Keep away! Keep away!

230
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,440
The score's 1-1! You can just tie here!

231
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,840
So just keep away from her any way you can!

232
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,390
Keep away?

233
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,270
I don't know if I can do it, but I'll try!

234
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,570
Hajime!

235
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, no! Trailing that small girl on points has made Mimieux incensed!

236
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,100
Calm down! Calm—

237
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,630
Hey, where are you going?

238
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,630
Why are you actually running away from her?!

239
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,670
Sh-Shido!

240
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,810
Kyonkyon! I did say "keep away,"
 but you'll lose if you do it that way!

241
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,020
When we say "keep away,"
 that means "avoid her moves"!

242
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,490
Watch out!

243
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,280
Don't let her get too close!

244
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,830
An Osoto Gari!

245
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,660
Pull up your hips!

246
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,920
Koka!



247
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,610
Dammit! She's got a Shido and a Koka against her!

248
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,120
But she's keeping away well!

249
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,350
If she keeps on evading, she'll win!

250
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,420
She's doing an Osaekomi! Turn into a turtle!

251
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,470
Please hold her off!

252
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,850
Only one more minute!

253
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,180
Kyonkyon!

254
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,780
Kyonkyon, hang in there!

255
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,460
Only 40 seconds left!

256
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,130
Oh, no!

257
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,500
That's a choke hold!

258
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,380
An Okuri Eri Jime?

259
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,500
Kyonkyon!

260
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,890
Say "I give up," Kyonkyon!

261
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,390
Stop now!

262
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,640
Oh, no!

263
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,980
Inokuma-san will go to Tsurukame Tra...</i>

264
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,860
Please, stop this! Give up!

265
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,910
I have to send her there... To Tsurukame Travel.</i>

266
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,380
I have to send her there.</i>

267
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,740
Ippon! Done!

268
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,720
Hey, she's not moving!

269
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,300
Oh man, she's out cold!

270
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,940
Kyonkyon!

271
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,870
Really now.

272
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,940
Excuse me.

273
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,990
You sure made it close.

274
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,870
Kyonkyon?

275
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,460
Are you all right, Kyonkyon?

276
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,970
I-I... lost, didn't I?

277
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,510
No.

278
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,430
It's all right now. You were great, Kyonkyon.

279
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm sorry, Inokuma-san.

280
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,900
Kyonkyon!

281
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,610
Well, well.

282
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,240
You really are my students.


283
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,040
You really are the nation's top team.

284
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,870
Gotta admire those guts!

285
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,860
I wanna see more of that in the next two matches.

286
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,900
That small player displayed such tremendous tenacity in her match.


287
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,600
Master Jigoro, once again I bow my head to you.


288
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,620
W-Wait a minute, the Mitsuba team is now down 1-2!

289
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,150
That means...

290
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,930
Our chance of getting Inokuma Yawara is now hanging by a thread!

What will you do now, Matsuda-san? You're out of options.

293
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,540
O-Our next opponent is the
 72kg-and-under player, Prost.

294
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,880
We're doomed!

295
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
Sh-She specializes in the Newaza after doing a Maki Komi? 

296
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,640
We will now begin the fourth match!




297
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,150
Please, forget about me and have fun out there, Yoshinagawa-san.

298
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,150
Don't strain yourself. Just have fun, okay?

299
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,400
Yeah...

300
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,030
I... must've lost three kilos while waiting for my turn.

301
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,410
Listen! She specializes in the Maki Komi, then the Newaza!

302
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,690
Norimakis, curry, and the Nebuta Festival.

303
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,880
We're done for.

306
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,980
Yoshinagawa-san, just have fun.

307
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,400
Hey! Put some elbow grease in there, French girl!

308
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,240
She's just big. Why are you playing around?

309
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,120
There's your chance! Don't let her go!

310
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,870
Yawara!

311
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,740
Thank God I'm Fat!
