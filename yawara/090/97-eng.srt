I'm starting to appreciate again just how important <i>she</i> is.

"She"?

4
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,450
But we haven't heard from her since the Ajisai Cup.

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
I say it's eerie how we ain't heard from her.

6
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,500
From that highfalutin heiress.

I'm going to take a bath.

You call this a story?

You don't seem very enthused about your work lately.

15
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,950
What the hell happened?

16
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,050
No kidding!

17
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,240
Kosaku has been feeling down lately.

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,220
I even invited him for yakiniku to cheer him up, but he acted like he didn't hear me!

19
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,180
What? It still eats you that Inokuma Yawara won't be transferring to Saikai U?

20
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,200
Plus Tsurukame Travel, a no-name company without a judo team, snatched her away,

21
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,900
which makes a dull story?

22
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,540
Moping all the time won't change a damn thing!

23
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,200
I see. Can you offer a comment?

24
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,470
Inokuma Yawara is graduating from Mitsuba today.

25

You sure you don't want to go?

26

Don't worry, Chief.

27
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,670
Kosaku has absolutely no interest in Yawara-chan's new career.

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,090
If she'd gone to Barcelona and won a gold medal for him,

29
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,430
that would've made a good article, right, Kosaku?







30
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,690
He's finally out of the picture.

31
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,870
I can't believe Matsuda-san got incensed...

32
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,410
and told her himself that he was only chasing her for the articles.

33
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:53,190
His words would sour even a hundred-year romance.

34
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,460
Well, he's an amateur after all.



35
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,180
Matsuda-san was never a meaningful love rival.

36

Right now, Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke will snatch you all for himself.

156
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,450
We're leaving now.

157
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,200
Let's have an awesome thank-you party later!

158
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,400
You have weird taste!

159
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,110
Still better than yours!

160
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,120


161
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,670
Oh, my gosh! Look at all those cars!

162
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,460
Are they all here to pick someone up?

163
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,720
Maybe we should get some tea.

164
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,750
Um, I actually...



165
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,650
U-Uh, this is Yoshida-san, a caregiver I met while doing pre-school training.

166
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,990
This is his friend, Kimura-kun.

167
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,350
So, I guess you can call it a group acquaintance.

168
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,920
Hi, nice to meet you.

169
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,170
We've heard so much about you two.

170
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,480
Nice to meet you too.

171
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,660
Thanks for looking after our friends.

172
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,840
W-We'll be seeing you!

173
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,200
Congratulations.

174
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,850
Thank you.

175
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900


176
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,860
Here I am!

177
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:46,860
Yo.

178
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,030
Now listen here!

179
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,020
I'm busy right now!

180
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Shin-chan, you have a date with yet another woman, don't you?

181
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,050
Of course not! I have work to do — work!

182
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,480
Right now, you're the only one, Mayumi.

183
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,510
Bye!

184
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,160
Hey, wait!

185
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,560
Look, I have to leave right now.

186
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,320
Is your work more important than me?

187
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,570
N-No, you're more important!

188
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,030
Geez, will you be quiet!

189
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,210
"Be quiet"? What the heck, Shin-chan?

190
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,980
No, I was talking about the doorbell!

191
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,710
Someone's here to collect the newspaper subscription!

192
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,130
Can we do this later? I'm busy right now!

193
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,100
Shin-chan!

194
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,960
Shin-chan, what's going on?

195
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,020
Shin-chan!

196
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,900
What a surprise. I can't believe Kyonkyon has a boyfriend!

197
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,150
Me either.

198
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,360
You really can't underestimate anyone.

199
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,620
So should we go get some tea?

200
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,830
Oh, Fujiko-san... the thing is, I'm actually...

201
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,090
What the hell are you doing?

202
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,600
Hanazono-san!

203
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,650
F-Fujiko-san!

204
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,230
Hanazono-san!

205
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,220
I couldn't get out... of my training.

206
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,120
Congratulations!

207
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,350
For me?


208
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,050
I kept it in my breast pocket, so it might smell sweaty.

209
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,810
It smells nice!

210
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,260
How wonderful.</i>

211
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,870
This might be an unclean vehicle, but please hop on.

212
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,770
O-Okay.

213
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,320
Um... B-But... Inokuma-san is still... 

214
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,740
Don't worry about me.

215
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,120
But...

216
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,100
Oh, you two can ride the bicycle.

217
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,750
I'll run alongside. It'll be good training.

218
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,290
Really, I'll be fine!

219
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,970
But...

220
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,860
I got it! You're waiting for Matsuda-san!

221
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,300
Matsuda-san? N-No, I'm not!

222
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,490
I see. So it's Matsuda-san.

223
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,060
I can be so dumb!

224
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,560
You're wrong!

225
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,200
See you later!

226
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,020
Don't worry. We'll stay out of your way!

227
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,570
You've got it all wrong. God!

228
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,030
I hope it all goes as well as a judo match!

229
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,530
I'm telling you...

230
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,450
Don't be so stubborn!




231
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,030
Fight on, Inokuma!

232
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,470
Yahoo!

233
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,080
No winning on points! Score an Ippon!

234
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,950
I'm not waiting for Matsuda-san!

235
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,810
I'm sorry you had to drive me home.

236
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,060
You must be tired. You'd better get some rest.

237
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,610
Okay. I'll see you again.

238
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,480
Yawara-san!

239
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
Yes?

240
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,260
You're finally graduating, aren't you?

241
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,320
I'll definitely come and pick you up after the ceremony.

242
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,780
We'll celebrate at a five-star restaurant, just the two of us.

243
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,780
Will three o'clock at the gate be all right?

244
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,330
Of course! I'd be happy to!

245
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,830
I'll see you.

246
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,210
Kazamatsuri-san...</i>

247
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,850
Kazamatsuri-san...

248
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,240
Yeah...

249
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,920
God, you're late!

250
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,330
I'm sorry!

251
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,650
Geez, everyone else got picked up. 
That girl and I were the only ones left!

252
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,460
Wow, so she's still waiting for someone?

253
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,850
What happened to Kazamatsuri-san?

254
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,110
He's not picking up his phone.

255
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,890
Now that we at Tsurukame Travel have hired Inokuma Yawara-san,

256
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,170
we are certainly flying high.

257
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,740
Are you ready for this?

258
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,520
Huh? 

259
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:46,370
You have in your hand the jewel of Japanese sports... no, of international sports.

260
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,540
If you try to milk Yawara-san as an
 advertising gimmick till she's crushed,

261
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,630
you'll be sorry!

262
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,130
Stop that!

263
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,020
If we give up Yawara-san to these people,

264
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,140
a gold medal for her in Barcelona will be just a dream!

265
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,560
That's <i>your</i> dream.

266
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,560
You're damn right it's my dream!

267
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,360
And I'll keep chasing that dream <i>and</i> Yawara-san!

268
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,410
He's only trying to write an article.</i>

269
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,440
He's bothering me just to see if he can get a scoop.</i>

270
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,030
C-Congratulations...

271
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,940
on getting your degree.

272
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,510
Thank you.


273
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,520
She <i>does</i> have the wrong idea.</i>

274
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,240
Well, I did say all that stuff without thinking.</i>

275
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,940
Here it comes.</i>

276
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,180
What is it this time?</i>

277
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,180
"What are your ambitions now that you've entered the workforce?"</i>

278
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,180
It is certainly my dream for Yawara-san to get the gold at Barcelona.</i>

279
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,190
You're always going after the next article, Matsuda-san.</i>

280
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,190
B-But that's not all.</i>



281
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,820
You don't have a clue.</i>

282
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,150
My feelings...</i>

283
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,660
You don't care how I feel.</i>

284
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,200
I... </i>

285
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,000
Y-Yawara-san!

286
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,540
I... know what I said the other day.

287
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,590
It's not what I really meant. That was...

288
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,910
How should I put this? I was...

289
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,070
Inokuma Yawara!

290
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,910
Ho... H-H-Ho...

291
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,580
H-Honami Sayaka?!

292
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,540
It is time to settle our feud.

293
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,600
Right now.

294
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,810
At the All-Japan Judo Championships.

295
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,470
Kazamatsuri-san...

296
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,930
Let us put an end... to this petty gamesmanship.

297
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,890
You will fight me directly, fair and square,

298
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,550
Inokuma Yawara.

299
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,080
Kazamatsuri-san...</i>

Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 166 Days#

301
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,350
So Miss Sayaka has finally come back!

302
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,040
Matsuda-san is always talking about judo.

303
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,400
When it comes to me, it's always about what will make a good headline.

304
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,100
Yawara! Now that our heiress is back,

305
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,820
there's no time for gallivanting around as an office girl.

306
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,890
Still, why is Kazamatsuri-san with Sayaka-san?

307
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,180
I swear, men are full of it!

308
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,870
Yawara!

309
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,280
First Kiss!

310
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,870
Wh-What?!

311
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,550
<b>First Kiss!</b>

312
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,800
