00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,780
Thank you so much for tonight. I had a lot of fun.

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,950
Good night.

00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,280

Thank goodness for everything!

7
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,920
Yawara came to our new employee ceremony today!

8
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,880

12
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,270
So has HR formalized Inokuma Yawara's staffing assignment?

13
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,150
Yes, of course.

14
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,390
Make sure she doesn't do any actual work.

15
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,500
We don't want to get in the way of her judo.

16
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,870
No need to worry. We've taken everything into consideration.

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,710
Sir, we'll finally become one of the top three in our industry!

18
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,640
Top three? Don't think so small!

19
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,970
We're going to topple Honami Travel, the leader in the industry!

20
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,270
Honami Travel's going down!

21
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,190
Yeah!

22
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,400
And that arrogant, loudmouthed Honami girl is going down in flames at the All-Japan!

23
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,990
Yeah!

Over here are the accident insurance policies...

27
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,970
So that's Inokuma Yawara, huh?
Over here are the accident insurance policies...

28
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,110
Because she's so strong, I wondered how overpowering she'd be in person, but...

29
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,570
She's just a normal girl!

30
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,890
She could've stuck with judo, though.

31
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,130
She's so lucky.

32
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm jealous.

33
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,160
You said it.

34
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,030
I wish she'd throw me once.

35
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,310
Now then, let's move on.

36
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,110
I'll now explain what we do on the second floor. Please come upstairs.

Sorry!

41
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,620
Yawara-san...</i>






42
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,500
And that's how it is, Kazamatsuri-kun.

43
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,990
Kazamatsuri-kun!

44
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,500
Yes?

45
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,380
Geez. Well, to be brief, I think the time is right.

46
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,550
Yeah...

47
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,260
Could you be more specific?

48
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,010
Sayaka is about to turn 21.

49
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,020
I think we've waited long enough.

50
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,110
We've waited... long enough?


51
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,900
Sayaka has built up a considerable amount of confidence, thanks to her secret training.

52
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,410
She's even talking about

53
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,240
a showdown with Inokuma Yawara at the All-Japan Championships.

54
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,110
Of course I am.

55
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,320
I will soon make Inokuma Yawara cry bitter tears on the arena mat.

56
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,680
Turning to the matter at hand, Kazamatsuri-kun.

57
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,080
Uh...

58
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,210
So what you're saying is...

59
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,880
You're marrying Sayaka!

60
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,030
Uh, right. H-However, but...

61
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,320
E-Even if she fights Inokuma Yawara at the tournament,

62
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,240
w-wouldn't Sayaka still be guaranteed a berth for the Barcelona Oly—

63
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,710
The Olympics are of no concern to me.

64
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,080
I only practice judo in order to defeat Inokuma Yawara.

65
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
That's my motivation.

66
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,330
I have no need for some gold-plated medal.




67
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,350
And there you have it, Kazamatsuri-kun.

68
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,350
Wait. This is all so sudden.

69
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,590
I don't know what to say...

70
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,220
I almost forgot. We have one additional piece of good news to discuss.

71
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,320
Fukumoto-kun and Ishihara-kun, you'll be with Assistant Manager Okuyama.

72
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,580
It's a pleasure to meet you!

73
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,930
Yes, same here.

74
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,440
And your trainer...

75
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,060
Yes?

76
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,850
...will be Assistant Manager Hagoromo.

77
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,070
It's a pleasure to meet you!

78
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,280
Sorry.

79
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,480
That's him, way in the back.

80
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,450
My mistake!

81
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,560
I see you're excited about this. That's the spirit.

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,590
Hagoromo-san.

83
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,460
Hagoromo-san? Assistant Manager Hagoromo?

84
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,260
Assistant Manager Hagoromo?

85
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,240
This is our new employee, Inokuma Yawara-san.

86
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,580
It's a pleasure to meet you.

87
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,670
She's all yours, then.

00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,310
Make us proud, Inokuma-san.

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,730
U-Um, is there something I can do?

92
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,740
Um, do you like sitting by the window?

93
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,870
I like how it's warm and sunny.

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,900
Have you done any outside errands?

95
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,340
No, I...

96
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,500
Let's go. The weather's nice anyway.

97
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,430
Okay!

98
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,390
Huh? Wh-What did you just say?

99
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm saying I would like you to become president of Honami Travel!

100
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,480
P-President? Of Honami Travel?

101
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,570
The travel agency business is really competitive right now.

102
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,960
That's why we need a youthful business sense such as yours.

103
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,540
No need to worry.

104
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,600
You'll be surrounded by the best and the brightest!

105
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,430
You can just relax and take the helm, and everything will work out.

This was your idea, Sayaka-san!</i>

107

 Tsurukame Travel's standing in the industry.</i>

So she's sending me in to crush them?</i>

109

It looks like you've gotten used to Saikai U, Fujiko-san.

110
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,040
I'll never get used... to this tough training!

111
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,040
You're probably training this hard

112
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,240
to show them you can handle the All-Japan Championships.

113
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,750
No way. I'm not good enough!

114
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,920
By the way, how about Yawara-san?

115
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,250
Did she say whether she's entering the tournament?

116
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,750
You haven't seen Inokuma-san lately?

117
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,470
N-No, I've been very busy recently.

What are you doing?

119
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,510
You need to hold on tight to her,
 especially now that she's a working woman!

120
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,210
She might be drinking tea somewhere with a handsome, senior coworker right now!

E-Excuse me.

122
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,270
Is drinking coffee at a café part of our errands?

We usually put together company outings for businesses.

124
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,490
Then is it all right for us to do this?

125
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,650
We don't usually deal with the offices around here.

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,920
Let's go, Inokuma-kun.

179
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,950
Come on. You can stay a little longer!

180
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,870
No, we've imposed on you long enough.

181
00:14:59,410 --> 00:14:59,870
Oh?

182
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,860
Oh, Mr. Department Chief!

183
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh...

184
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,650
Sir, this is the judo champion Inokuma Yawara-san.

185
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,980
I knew it was you, Yawara-chan! Yawara-chan!

186
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,460
Pleased to meet you!

187
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,100
Wait. What brings <i>the</i> Yawara-chan here?

188
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,260
Um, do you have any plans for a company outing?

189
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,480
Accept our apologies! We were about to leave.

190
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Now, now, there's no need to go so soon.

191
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,610
Should I become a company president and marry Sayaka-san?</i>

192
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,600
Or should I choose Yawara-san?</i>

193
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
What will it be: love or money?</i>

194
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,780
The waves of fate are toying with me.</i>

195
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:12,490
Where will the currents take Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke?</i>

196
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,360
But... But wait!</i>

197
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,400
Even if Inokuma Kojiro trained Sayaka-san in secret, can she beat Yawara-san?</i>

198
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,220
The Yawara-san?</i>

199
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,260
No way. There's no way she could win—

200
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,390
Next!

201
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,640
Next!

202
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,350
Next!

203
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,120
Next!

204
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,710
M-My God, she's changed completely.

205
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,360
That's not the old Sayaka-san!

206
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,080
Kojiro-san, how did you transform her into that?</i>

207
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,630
Th-This means...</i>

208
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,140
This means... the April 22nd All-Japan Championships may be the day...

209
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,280
See, what did I tell you? What did I tell you?

210
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,220
We have a big mess on our hands. I just know it!

211
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,640
I really hate messes! I really do!

212
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,660
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,620
Hey, sorry to keep you.

214
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,850
Please accept our apologies.
W-We'll take our leave right now.

215
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,070
Now, now, please have a seat.

216
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,890
We have a lot to discuss.

217
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,970
In a nutshell, we're trying to negotiate an important business deal.

218
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,070
We're planning a golf outing with our potential partners.




219
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,610
If we land this deal, it'll mean a lot for our company.

220
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,690
Can you arrange a three day, two night, first class Hokkaido golf event?

221
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,130
Uh, that will be for ten, right, sir?

222
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,790
Mm-hmm, yes, of course.

223
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,570
A Hokkaido golf event?

224
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,800
F-First class for t-ten?




225
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,920
It might be short notice, but can you arrange it?

226
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,420
W-We can handle it, right, sir?

227
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,310
I-I believe we can handle it.

228
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:57,110
And another thing. The executive we're dealing with is a big fan of yours.

229
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,070
A-A big fan, you say?

230
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,790
A big fan of Yawara-chan, of course.

231
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,310
Hold on tight to her, huh?</i>

232
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,750
Oh, so the media jackal is here?

233
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,810
J-Jigoro-san!

234
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,470
So how's Beanpole looking these days?

235
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,220
Quite well, actually. She's getting stronger by the day.

236
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,030
Then there's that damn <i>working</i> girl of mine.

237
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,360
I don't care if she's an OL or an S&L.

238
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,330
I can't believe she's leaving judo for a job!

239
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,530
Yawara-san is going to enter the All-Japan Championships, isn't she?

240
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,710
Great!

241
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,710
Ah, Master!



242
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,860
That was really great!
 What a spectacular Uchi Mata!

243
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,010
You really are my pupil. That was a real beauty!

244
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,650
It wasn't that good.

245
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,430
If only we could see that clean move in a real match.

246
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,220
Yes, if only. But I always get nervous during competitions.

247
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,850
And you'll feel even more anxious if Yawara isn't around.

248
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,540
Yes.

249
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:23,820
I don't know what I'll do in the All-Japan tournament without Inokuma-san.

250
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,900
She's only concerned with that new job of hers.

251
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,350
So it's true she might not enter?!

252
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,080
I wish she'd enter it, at least for your sake.

253
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,850
I'm already over the hill.

254
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,840
Setting her straight is too much for these old bones.

255
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,170
She has to enter the tournament!

256
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,350
Let me do it! I'll try to convince her myself!

257
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,770
April 22nd is a Sunday, so she'll be off from work! I'm sure she'll enter!

258
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,770
I'm counting on you, Beanpole.

259
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,800
Yes, I imagine that's so!

260
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,340
This is the great Inokuma Yawara we're talking about,

261
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,130
so of course an executive of a major company would be a fan of hers.

262
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,880
So, how does your client being her fan relate to all this?

263
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,180
Well, he'd really like it if Inokuma-san went with us.

264
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,140
I-If I went?

265
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,350
B-But she's a recent hire.
 She doesn't know how things work.

266
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,740
If everything goes well with this deal, we're willing to drop Honami Travel

267
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,330
and arrange all our company outings, business trips, and other affairs through your firm.

268
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,410
She'll be there! We're sending her there!

269
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,010
I'll come along to cover for her inexperience!

270
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,240
We don't need you to come.

271
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,550
So, Inokuma-san, do you accept?

272
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,560
Y-Yes. Of course I'll go.

273
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,530
It will be three days and two nights, starting April 21st. Will that be okay?

274
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,050
Of course!

275
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:40,570
So it will be a first class Hokkaido golf tour for April 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, correct?












276
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,150
We gladly accept!

277
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 152 Days#

278
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,860
Working can be so exciting!

279
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,990
You're slacking!

280
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,650
The All-Japan Judo Championships are coming up. What have you gotten yourself into?!

281
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,540
All right, time to do my best in Hokkaido!

282
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,590
Listen, Yawara! Don't forget to be at the National Martial Arts Hall on April 22nd!

283
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,340
What? But that's the day I... What'll I do?!

284
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,490
Yawara!

285
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,910
Hokkaido and the National Marial Arts Hall.

286
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,280
