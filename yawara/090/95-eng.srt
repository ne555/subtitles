1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,660
Ow...

4
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,970
Don't get up! Just keep clinging to her!

5
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,470
Grab her collar and tighten your hold!

6
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,760
Don't let her go!

7
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,090
Only three more seconds!

8
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,090
Two!

9
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,060
One!

10
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,110
Ippon!

11
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,850
Done!

12
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,820
All right!

13
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,840
Sayuri won!

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

15
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,150
It's all part of Master Jigoro's scheme.

16
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,400
Fujiko-san can't stand a lot of pressure.

17
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,640
The fact that Yawara-san's job is riding on her match has already made her nervous.

18
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,540
And now, the auditorium is filled with people cheering her name,

19
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,140
for some strange reason.

20
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,380
Fujiko-san.

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,280
I-I'm all right, I-Inokuma-san!

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,900
D-D... worry about me!

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,950
I-I w-will... d-definitely win!

24
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,320
Hajime!

25
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,760
Fujiko-san, don't directly engage her!

26
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,150
She'll try overwhelming you with a power move!

27
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,140
I'll win! I will win!</i>

28
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,450
Fujiko-san!

29
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,670
Jougai! Mate!

30
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,190
Fujiko-san! Loosen your shoulders. Relax!

31
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,700
It's no good! She's too fixated on her match to hear us!

32
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,730
Fujiko-san!

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,820
Watch out!

34
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,830
A Kata Guruma!

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,660
Yuko!

36
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,000
Fujiko-san.

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,090
That Nervous Nelly ain't beating such a powerful opponent.

38
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,850
We're finally settling things here!

39
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Get That Ippon and Win!

40
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,010
F-Fujiko-san!




41
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,460
Just a little more, Moréchand!

42
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,610
I-I can't believe it.

43
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,970
Fujiko-san is down by a Yuko!

44
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,650
I can, because she's so nervous.

45
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,980
Fujiko-san... I know all too well how you feel.

46
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,420
This plan is going perfectly, just perfectly.

47
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,500
I-I see!

48
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,340
You're putting psychological pressure on Ito Fujiko!

49
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,240
Very ingenious, Master Jigoro!

50
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,750
Mate!

51
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,380
Sir!

52
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,220
We're teetering on the edge!

53
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,500
You call this a crisis?

54
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,940
Tsurukame Travel has faced bigger crises in its 30-year existence!

55
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,660
College girls, make some noise and make it loud!

56
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,030
Sir!

57
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,490
We need Ito Fujiko to win this match for us!

58
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,500
If Ito wins thanks to your hearty cheers...

59
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,200
I'll give you all free trips to Hong Kong!

60
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,460
If Ito-san wins, it'll be all over TV and the news!

61
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,890
We'll get free trips to Hong Kong too!



62
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,210
What kind of game is this?

63
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,340
Who cares? Anyway...

64
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,230
Ito-senpai, good luck!

65
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,120
Go, go, Fujiko!

66
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,300
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

67
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,890
Yes, that's the spirit! Hey, you guys better join in!
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

68
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:15,900
Yes, that's the spirit! Hey, you guys better join in!

69
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,500
Come on!

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,240
Right.

71
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,400
The place is electrified again!

72
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,010
It's making Fujiko-san even more nervous!

73
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,500
Fujiko-san, relax! Watch her moves closely!

74
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,300
I-I have to win...</i>

75
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,600
so Inokuma-san can join Tsurukame Travel!</i>

76
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,400
Watch out! That's a Sukui Nage!

77
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,520
Yuko!

78
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,720
She's no match for her!

79
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,160
Fujiko-san?

80
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Dammit!

81
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm standing around twiddling my thumbs. Is that all I can do for her?

82
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,310
No.

83
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,840
This is the time for you to lend her your strength.

84
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
H-How?

85
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,680
By helping Fujiko-san relax.

86
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,630
O-Okay, but how?

87
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,180
Come on.

88
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,000
There must be something romantic you whisper to her all the time.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Even while looking like that.

90
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000
No!

91
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,020
Go say those things to her now.


92
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,710
It'll help her relax. And knowing who I am, I guarantee it.

93
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,250
B-But I've never said that kind of stuff to her!

94
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,970
Wait a minute. You're doing the deed with her, aren't you?

95
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,590
Th-The deed? What kind of "deed"?!

96
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,600
W-Wait. Are you telling me you haven't done anything?

97
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,100
I-I mean, you have asked her to go out with you, haven't you?

98
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,800
Hang in there, Fujiko-san!

99
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,490
U-Unbelievable.

100
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,020
Okay, then now's a good chance.

101
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,870
Confess your love for her, right here!

102
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,960
Your feelings will get through to her, and she will relax.

103
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,790
If she wins her match,
 Yawara-san will be able to work.

104
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,640
You'll solve all our problems just by saying one thing!

105
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,260
Th-That's dumb! You mean right here?

106
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,160
This is no time to be shy!

107
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,350
B-But what am I supposed to say?!

108
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,020
Watch out!

109
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,770
Get away, Fujiko-san!

110
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,080
Get away from her, Fujiko-san!

111
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,870
F-Fujiko-san!

112
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,140
Fujiko-san, don't push it!

113
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,860
Settle down! Just calm—

114
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,820
F-Fuji...

115
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,650
Fujiko-san!

116
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,100
O-Once this match is over...

117
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,010
let's go somewhere for tea!

118
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,520
H-How stupid are you?!

119
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,020
H-Hanazono-san!</i>

120
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,980
Look!

121
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,540
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

122
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,610
Fujiko-san has finally...

123
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,120
recovered her "un, deux, trois" rhythm!

124
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,830
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux...</i>

125
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,020
Trois!</i>

126
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,590
Trois!

127
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,190
All right!

128
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,150
Waza Ari!

129
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,650
Oh, so close! That was almost an Ippon!

130
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,040
But Fujiko-san's Waza Ari beats Moréchand's two Yukos!

131
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,070
She's in the lead!

132
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,450
Hanazono-san!

133
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,060
Thank you, Hanazono-san.
 I was completely frozen with fear!</i>

134
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,860
That was great, Hanazono-kun!

135
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,050
You made Fujiko-san relax!

136
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,540
You're so sensitive to her needs.

137
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,750
Oh, no!

138
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,260
I'm not that sensitive.

139
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,300
These novices scare me sometimes.</i>

140
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,160
What is this, a cheap romance flick?</i>

141
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,430
Still, it looks like that move would've been a hit with Yawara-san.</i>

142
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,620
That was awesome, Hanazono-kun!

143
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,040
Now Fujiko-san is relaxed!

144
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,030
Master! Ito is ahead on points!

145
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,430
Relax, you know she's just gonna try to duck and run. However...

146
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,050
I never taught her how to do evasive judo.

147
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,920
Sir, she did it!

148
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,420
All she has to do is run out the clock!

149
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,940
Yes, she's all but ours!

150
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,980
Hajime!

151
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,940
Two minutes left.

152
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,000
Keep away, Fujiko-san!

153
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,650
I-I know. I'm staying away from her!</i>

154
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,650
Go ahead and run. She's just gonna catch you when you slip up.

155
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,330
I only have to avoid a loss. I can even just tie.</i>

156
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,840
If that happens, Inokuma-san will win the tie-breaking match.</i>

157
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,840
Fujiko-san!

158
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,470
J-Jougai!

159
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,060
See, that's what happens when you dunno how to run.

160
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,060
Oh, no! I can't evade well!</i>

161
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
What should I do?!</i>

162
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,640
You win by Ippons!</i>

163
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,620
If you don't get that Ippon, your opponent will.</i>

164
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,110
H-He's right!</i>

165
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,810
Master Jigoro may be an enemy now, but he's still right!</i>

166
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,460
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

167
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,000
Un... deux...</i>

168
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,620
That's an Ouchi! Get away, Moréchand!

169
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,580
Don't push your luck, Fujiko-san!

170
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,770
She has the lead, yet she's still taking the offensive.

171
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,550
Master Jigoro's judo is fearsome to behold.

172
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,740
Mate!

173
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,200
Hey, she doesn't have to attack!

174
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,100
Just stay away and you'll win!






175
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,860
Yes, please keep away!


176
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,110
Don't get cocky!

177
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,360
She's...

178
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,870
Get away! If she grabs you, she'll throw you!

179
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,080
Fujiko-san!

180
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,920
She's doing Grandpa's judo, the "get-that-Ippon" judo.

181
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

182
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,180
Un! Deux!</i>

183
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,000
The Nutcracker!

184
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,770
Uchi Mata, Moréchand!

185
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,320
Whoa, this is amazing!

186
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,850
Ito's not evading. Instead, she's attacking head on!

187
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,200
Go! Give her everything you got!

188
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,900
Fujiko-san.

189
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,460
Trois!

190
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,550
She's going for it again!

191
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,460
Uchi Mata!

192
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,400
Moréchand slipped through her Uchi Mata!

193
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
Watch out, Fujiko-san!

194
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,430
Ippon!

195
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,450
No, Waza Ari!

196
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,690
Aw, man, she's behind again!

197
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,280
Moréchand is up by two Yukos again!


198
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,270
Wh-What'll you do now?!

199
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,240
You went overboard, and look what happened!

200
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,900
You <i>moron</i> !

201
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,760
The future of our company is riding on this match!


202
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,010
I'm holding you personally responsible!

203
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,040
Mate!

204
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,540
We should be okay now.

205
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,480
I was worried for a while.

206
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,520
But now Yawara-san's transfer to Saikai U is in the bag!

207
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,880
Our judo team will also teach Ito Fujiko the proper strategies for winning!

208
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,060
I don't blame her, because she hasn't played a lot of matches,

209
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,290
but she's still wet behind the ears

210
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,560
when it comes to evasive judo, right, Master Jigoro?

211
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
...mush for brains, for pity's sake.

212
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,200
If you don't change your attack rhythm,

213
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,130
you're just telegraphing your moves, peabrain!

214
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,170
Huh?

215
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,910
Why did she have to take it that far?!

216
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,620
Goddammit!

217
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,520
She could've run out the clock with her comfortable lead!

218
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,380
Only a minute and a half left. This won't be easy.

219
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,400
Can't she do something?!

220
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,440
Not the way things look now.

221
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,400
You're doing great, Fujiko-san!

222
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,610
Keep that up and you'll do fine!

223
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,220
Inokuma-san?

224
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,920
Yawara-san?

225
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,720
Inokuma?





226
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
She only knows your timing!

227
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,020
Just change your rhythm!

228
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,320
She knows my timing?</i>

229
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,040
Hajime!

230
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,590
So I'll change my rhythm!</i>

231
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,000
Look! Now Moréchand is trying to win by avoiding direct engagement!

232
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Please let her grab a good spot!

233
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,540
Oh! She got the back collar!

234
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,060
Very good, Fujiko-san!
 You've been practicing a lot!

235
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,280
Change my rhythm! Change my rhythm!</i>

236
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,040
Fujiko-san, don't be too hasty!

237
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
There! Turn to the right!

238
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,140
Yawara-san.</i>

239
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,660
She's lost her job, for all we know.</i>

240
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,650
She's in a real tight spot.
 Why is she enjoying herself?</i>

241
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,670
You can do it!

242
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,830
Trois!

243
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,510
Fight it off, Moréchand!

244
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,970
Jougai! Mate!

245
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,260
Yes! That's the way, Fujiko-san!

246
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,260
Yawara-san looks like she's fighting a strong opponent!</i>

247
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,690
And the player she thinks is that good is... Could it be?</i>

248
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,520
Looking good, Ito!

249
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,430
Go after her with everything you've got!

250
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,690
Please, win!

251
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,650
Ladies, at the top of your lungs!

252
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,740
Hang in there, Ito-senpai!

253
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,830
...Fujiko!

254
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,660
Go, go, Fujiko!



255
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,240
I always knew she had the guts!

256
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,070
You really do have an eye for talent, Master!

257
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,680
Well, Ito's still going to lose today,

258
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,100
but she'll turn into a marvelous athlete!

259
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,880
Careful! If you try grabbing her recklessly, she'll come at you with her feet!

260
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,640
Only one minute left!

261
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,240
Do something!

262
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,920
Ippons! If you ain't getting Ippons, you ain't playing judo!</i>

263
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,950
You can do it!

264
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,450
Trois!

265
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,050
There she goes!

266
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,800
All right!

267
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,600
Yuko!

268
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,440
So close!

269
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,390
Why? Why can't I get it?!

270
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,760
Don't cry! Keep at it!

271
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,140
Just get another Yuko and tie it!

272
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,640
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

273
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,520
Fujiko-san!
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

274
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Inokuma-san!

275
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,740
Your left...

276
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,170
I can't hear you!

277
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,180
Finally, this is the end!

278
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,660
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!
Finally, this is the end!

279
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,660

Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

280
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:52,960
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

281
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,780
She's in a good position!
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

282
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,260
It may be her last chance!
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

283
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,280
It may be her last chance!

284
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,370
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

285
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,370
Fujiko-san, pull strongly with your left hand!

286
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,290
Un, deux...</i>

287
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,710
Pull strongly with your left hand!

288
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,230
Jougai! Mate!

289
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,400
H-Hang in there, Ito!

290
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,260
Go in there and get her again!

291
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,980
Why? Why can't I do it?</i>

292
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,220
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!
Why? Why can't I do it?</i>

293
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,210
You're pulling weakly with your left!
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

294
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:42,740
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

295
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,290
Master Jigoro?
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

296
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,440
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

297
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,420
I keep saying you're pulling weakly with your left.
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

298
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,750
Dummy!
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

299
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,390
Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko! Go, go, Fujiko!

300
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,150
N-No, wait! He must be plotting something.</i>

301
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,270
Master Jigoro is an enemy now!</i>

302
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,700
He's only thinking of ways to prevent Inokuma-san from getting a job.</i>

303
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,270
Win!

304
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,030
Get that Ippon and win this match!

305
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,040

Grandpa!

310
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,320
How long are you gonna play footsie with your opponent?

311
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,020
Just pull hard with your left and end it with an "un, deux, trois" already!

312
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,030
Fujiko-san, you're in a good position! You can do it!

313
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,920
Don't worry. Even Grandpa is rooting for you. Even Grandpa.

314
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,780
Yawara!
