1
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,680
Fujiko-san!

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,370
She's doing Grandpa's judo, the "get-that-Ippon" judo.

3
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,750
Go! Give her everything you got!

4
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,110
I always knew she had guts!

5
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,990
You really do have an eye for talent, Master!

6
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,870
Well, Ito's still going to lose today,

7
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,430
but she'll turn into a marvelous athlete!

8
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,890
You can do it, Fujiko-san!

9
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,650
Go, go, Fujiko!

10
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,610
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

11
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,700
Trois!

12
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,500
Jougai! Mate!

13
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,740
Hang in there, Ito!

14
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,510
Go in there and get her again!

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,910
Why? Why can't I do it?</i>

16
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,580
You're pulling weakly with your left!

17
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,230
Get that Ippon and win this match!

18
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,230
Wh-Wha—

19
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,240
G-Grandpa!

20
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,210
The Return of the Heiress

21
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,230
Wh-What are you saying, Master?

22
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,450
If Ito wins here, Yawara-san's transfer to Saikai U will...

23
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,530
What's going on, sir?


24
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,110
I thought her grandfather was opposing her?

25
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,920
I-I don't know!

26
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,180
Seriously, what did you just do, Gramps?

27
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,660
It's a trap.

28
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,220
A trap?

29
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,000
It can't be anything else.

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,630
He's Master Jigoro, the man who's done it all and seen it all.

31
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,300
So you know he's setting a trap.

32
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,650
He's right! Don't listen to that old man!

33
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,240
He's just messing with you!

34
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Master Jigoro is the enemy!
Don't listen to him!

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't listen to him!

36
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,950
Win! How many times must I say it?!

37
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,790
Quit wasting your time with that opponent, birdbrain!

38
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,260
Just pull hard with your left and do your "un, deux, trois" already!

39
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,310
Hajime!

40
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,800
Less than forty seconds left!

41
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,070
She's down by a Yuko! She has to get at least a Waza Ari!

42
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,210
Keep her away, Moréchand. Run out the clock!

43
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,080
We're winning against Inokuma Yawara's team!

44
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,610
Don't rush it, Fujiko-san!

45
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,220
Thirty seconds left!

46
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,170
Hey! Don't run, you cheater!

47
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,640
I don't care how you do it! Just win!

48
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,590
How many times must I say it?!

49
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,390
Just pull hard with your left and do your "un, deux, trois" already!

50
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,450
Ippon!

51
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,050
Now!

52
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,880
She's got her back collar!

53
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,590
Don't go out of bounds!

54
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,890
Un, deux, trois! Un, deux...</i>

55
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,770
You can do it!

56
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,230
Get away, Moréchand!

57
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,130
Trois!

58
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,610
There!

59
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,650
Trois!

60
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,220
Wow, she switched to an Ouchi Gari!

61
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,280
There she goes!

62
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,830
Mate! Jougai!

63
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,450
So close! That was an awesome combo move!

64
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,430
Shido!

65
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,330
She got an Instructional Shido.

66
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,210
Of course!

67
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,830
Moréchand's just been avoiding her opponent in order to win!

68
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,840
So how are we on points?

69
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,760
Let's see, Moréchand was up by a Yuko, but now she's...

70
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Moréchand still has the lead!

71
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,310
Don't worry, Fujiko-san!

72
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,320
You're in a very good position! You can do it, Fujiko-san!

73
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,950
Don't worry. Even Grandpa is rooting for you. Even Grandpa.</i>

74
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,900
Master, getting Ippons... getting Ippons is what judo is all about, isn't it?</i>

75
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,440
I will do it!</i>

76
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,570
Hajime!

77
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Will she try an Uchi Mata?</i>

78
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,810
Or an Ouchi Gari?</i>

79
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,750
Which one?</i>

80
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,010
Moréchand, keep away. Time's almost up!







81
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,750
Even if you get another Shido, we'll still win!

82
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,770
We're fine as long as Moréchand continues evading.</i>

83
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,490
I was wondering what would happen after Master said that,</i>

84
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,400
but now victory is at hand!</i>

85
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,940
Fifteen seconds left!

86
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,130
It's over!

87
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,860
Sir!

88
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,410
She's got the back collar!

89
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,950
This is her last chance!

90
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,460
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,210
Un, deux, trois.

92
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,740
Un, deux, trois!

93
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,010
She's close to a Jougai again!

94
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,290
If she gets another Jougai, she'll lose on time!

95
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,930
Only eight seconds left!

96
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,430
Un, deux...

97
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,430
...trois. Un, deux...

98
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,460
...trois!

99
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Five seconds!

100
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,650
Now! Un, deux...

101
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,840
Trois!

102
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,900
There goes her Uchi Mata!

103
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,870
Hold on!

104
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,940
Win!

105
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,130
Get that Ippon and win this match!

106
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,910
Ippon! Done!

107
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,820
What a huge comeback!

108
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,880
They finally won against the French team!

109
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,620
Yay! Hurray!

110
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,870
 

111
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,270
You big lug! 

112
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,590

Okay, line up, girls!

120
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,760
Make sure you put down your student ID number,

121
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,870
name, and measurements on this paper.

122
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,130
Man, she's already trying to recruit new members.

123
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,720
So that means the judo circle won't end with us!

124
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,390
Everyone was impressed with our match!

125
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,620
Our circle is a media darling!

126
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,150
It could be your ticket to a showbiz debut!

127
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,690
Really?!

128
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,570
It's true! I'm an actress myself!

129
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,450
She's using the same song and dance that reeled us in.

130
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,280
Yeah.

131
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,140
F-Fujiko-san.

132
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,500
What can I say? You're really...

133
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,590
Hanazono-san?

134
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,920
Y-Yes?

135
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,880
Thank you for inviting me to tea.

136
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,310
I was able to relax because you asked me to have tea with you!

137
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,120
Thank you so much!

138
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,120
O-Oh, well, I didn't know tea would make you this happy.

139
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,690
If that's the case, maybe I'll take you to this pork cutlet place.

140
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,120
You get some pretty good-sized servings with their Jumbo Cutlets Special.

141
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,640
I-I also know good yakiniku and all-you-can-eat places.

142
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,790
Inokuma-san!

143
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,140
Huh?

144
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,100
Fujiko-san! You're awesome! You're really strong!

145
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,760
No, it's all because of you!

146
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,730
Now you can go to Tsurukame Travel.

147
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,850
Yeah. 

148
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,770
Wait a minute...

149
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,790
Grandpa.

150
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,310
Where did he go?

151
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,520
The old man's gone!

152
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,540
And he would've given us great material.

153
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,970
He made us bring those expensive treats, and then he took off?

154
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,050
Geez, who can deal with this?!

155
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,620
Master Jigoro, where did you go?



156
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,460
I'd like to say something to you!

157
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,630
I'm not ashamed of my loss!

158
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,060
The fearsome Inokuma judo is <i>très bien</i> !

159
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,860
The "get-that-Ippon" judo described in this book is the honest truth!

160
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,070
Title: The Gentle Way Isn't Built in a Day
By Inokuma Jigoro#
The "get-that-Ippon" judo described in this book is the honest truth!

161
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,140
In that case, let's get an exclusive interview with Inokuma Yawara herself!

162
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,530
Yeah, we can't go back with nothing.

163
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,550
Yawara-san, the big announcement your grandfather hinted about...

164
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,070
it wasn't your transfer to Saikai U?

165
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
Uh, yeah.

166
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,780
Please, just one comment.

167
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,950
Th-They did it, sir!

168
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

169
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,170
We must do our part as well.

170
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,020
This is a good time for our press conference.

171
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,420
Sir, now is the time! Go!

172
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,980
Oh, right.

173
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,740
On this fine, auspicious day...

174
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,990
Who's this old fogey?

175
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,000
Why are you calling the president of Tsurukame Travel an old fogey?

176
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,780
Tsurukame?

177
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,450
What's Tsurukame Travel doing here?

178
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,330
As we gather here on this fine day,

179
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,490
we're happy to announce that Inokuma Yawara-san

180
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,670
will be part of the Tsurukame Travel family.

181
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,170
Screw it. Let's look for Gramps!

182
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,670
Yeah.




183
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,940
Let's look outside!

184
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,010
Wait, what did you...

185
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,990
...just say?

186
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,500
Uh, like I said...

187
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,940
Inokuma Yawara-san will officially be joining our company ranks.

188
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:55,950
What was that?
Inokuma Yawara-san will officially be joining our company ranks.

189
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,520
What was that?

190
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,820
It's over.

191
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,080
Yawara-san won't be going to Barcelona via Saikai U.

192
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,470
What are you complaining about, Yutenji?

193
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,590
Master, I've waited two years. Two whole years!

194
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,340
Enough of your whining. Let's go!

195
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,010
She rejected us back when she was in high school!

196
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,060
And now this!

197
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,450
Why does she hate us so much?

198
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,460
I thought I told you to quit whining!

199
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,610
And you, Master, why did you tell Ito to win, of all things?!

200
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,900
She was playing my kind of judo.

201
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:14,430
Those who play the judo I teach must always win.

202
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,190
Yutenji.

203
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,940
Yes?

204
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,170
You wanna get some udon?


205
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,870
Now that we at Tsurukame Travel have hired Inokuma Yawara-san,

206
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,380
we are certainly flying high.

207
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,300
Are you ready for this?

208
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,720
Huh?

209
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:58,770
You have in your hand the jewel of Japanese sports... no, of international sports.

210
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,230
Matsuda-san?



211
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,310
Yes. We at Tsurukame Travel, where you jet across the globe,

212
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,440
will do everything we can to make sure

213
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,090
that Yawara-san gets the gold at Barcelona.

214
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,910
We'll also do a tie-in!

215
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,560
We'll offer a Barcelona Olympics Tour!

216
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,560
We also plan to send a large booster squad to cheer for Yawara-san!

217
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,520
I get it! That will put Tsurukame Travel on top of the heap.

218
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,070
You've got yourself a real gem there!

219
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,930
Now listen up!



220
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,480
If you try to milk Yawara-san as an
 advertising gimmick till she's crushed,

221
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,830
you'll be sorry!

222
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,460
H-Hey, you!

223
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,460
Stop that! You're being too aggressive!

224
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,550
If we give up Yawara-san to these people,

225
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,470
a gold medal for her in Barcelona will be just a dream!

226
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,870
Oh, showing our true colors, aren't we?

227
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,580
It's not her dream to go there, it's yours.

228
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,480
All you want to do is to write articles about that.

229
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,600
You're damn right it's my dream!

230
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,990
And I'll keep chasing that dream <i>and</i> Yawara-san!

231
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,500
Do you see now? That's the true Matsuda-san.

235

Quit crying, dummy. You won't like your udon.

236
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,460
Still, Master, Yawara-san is the jewel of Japanese judo— no, of the world.

237
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,780
Yet she's going to that travel agency for God knows what reason.

238
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,740
At least she needs to enter the next All-Japan Judo Championships.

239
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,230
That contrary little fussbudget ain't gonna agree so easily.

240
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,550
Then how about this?

241
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,630
The All-Japan is an open-weight tournament.

242
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,440
We can recommend that Ito Fujiko be entered.

243
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,680
If Ito enters, then Yawara-san...

244
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,410
If two bosom buddies have fun sparring it out, they'll only dull their skills.

245
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,960
Saying that...

246
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm starting to appreciate again just how important <i>she</i> is.

247
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,280
"She"?

248
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,210
She sees Yawara as her greatest enemy.

249
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,130
She doesn't like to lose, and she'll stop at nothing to get what she wants.

250
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,300
She's an outstanding talent and has all the qualities we need right now.

251
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,750
Y-You're not saying...

252
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,430
I insist. We're friends, aren't we?

253
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,430
It's raining. Let me take you home.

254
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,970
But, I...

255
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,720
If you please.







256
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,720
But we haven't heard from her since the Ajisai Cup.

257
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,370
Actually, it may be more accurate to say she retired.

258
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,900
I say it's eerie how we ain't heard from her.

259
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,650
From that highfalutin heiress.

260
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,400
Tokunaga.

261
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,040
Miss?

262
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,050
I'm going to take a bath.

263
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,050
Yes, Miss.



264
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,550
I need to remove ten months of accumulated grime from my stay on that mountain.

266
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,850
The two years in junior college flew by so fast.

267
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,610
That's 'cause you spent your time fooling around.

268
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,130
It's too bad that we have to graduate.

269
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,490
But maybe I'll have some wonderful encounters in my new job!

270
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,460
Hear this, Yawara:

271
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,030
If being a fancy-pants office lady makes you skip practice,

272
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,530
you're quitting on the spot!

273
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,540
Grandpa, that wasn't part of our deal.

274
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,290
Yawara!
