1
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,870
Wow! Sports Spirits special guest is Honami Sayaka, who's making her comeback!

2
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,710
This program's starting off with a bang!

3
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,540
Go ahead, have a seat.

4
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,560
First, everybody is wondering about one thing.

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,120
We haven't seen or heard from you for ten long months.

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,850
Were you in fact in secret intensive training?

7
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,470
Intensive training? Moi?

8
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,510
Oh my, no. Intensive training would be so uncouth!

9
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,980
But rumor has it you hired a highly superior coach to train you really hard.

10
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,480
A highly superior coach?

11
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,280
Well...

12
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,780
Don't say it! Don't!</i>

13
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,910
That's a secret.



14
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,050
It <i>is</i> true, though, that I've been training under the world's best coach.

15
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,810
Thanks to him,

16
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,130
I've increased my already considerable strengths to unimaginable levels.

17
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,280
Those are the facts.

18
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,630
Just hearing that gives me chills.

19
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,560
So that's where you got the confidence to challenge Inokuma Yawara.

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,790
However, Honami-san, are you aware

21
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,640
that Inokuma Yawara is now working for Tsurukame Travel?

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,570
I found out a little while ago.



23
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,680
She can work for the trivial amount of loose change she's getting.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,540
It can be at Mud Turtle, Peeping Tom Travel, or any third-rate company, for all I care.

25
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,070
Wh-What?

26
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,330
Th-Third rate, you say?!

27
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,210
That... Honami witch!



28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,340
Don't think we won't beat you to a pulp!

29
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:17,170
You'll become Inokuma Yawara's victim at the All-Japan Judo Championships!

30
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,670
She's doing the same thing she did when she enrolled at MWJC:

31
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,680
going somewhere that has no judo team.



32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,130
You need to stop equivocating, Inokuma Yawara.

33
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,870
This is a ploy to make your opponents drop their guard

34
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,400
while you continue to train strenuously in the shadows.

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,930
Put an end to this petty gamesmanship.

36
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,910
You must fight me directly, fair and square, Inokuma Yawara.




37
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,830
Let's take a short break for commercials!

38
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,870
Sign: A list of Honami Group companies#

39
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,370
Yawara-san!

40
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,880
Yawara-san?

41
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,170
Where did she go?

42
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,380
Damn that Honami Sayaka!

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,300
Giving the Honami Group subsidiary Oshiuri TV an exclusive!

44
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,260
I gotta get to the TV station!

45
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,350
N-No, Yawara-san comes first.</i>

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,150
Yawara-san! Where are you?!

47
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:25,110
First Kiss!

48
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,190
Kazamatsuri-san... was with Sayaka-san.</i>

49
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,800
Say, did you see the TV just now?

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,720
Sure did! Honami Sayaka, right?

51
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,720
The All-Japan Judo Championships are going to be a blast!

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,730
Yeah, an epic cat fight between two women!

53
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,500
Hoo boy!

54
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,570
You said it!

More after the commercials.#

57
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,910
That domineering woman has made a comeback!

58
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,800
I don't like it.

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,870
I hope Inokuma-san didn't see that. She doesn't need to be bothered!

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,470
But Inokuma will have to accept the challenge sooner or later.

61
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,880
I really hate that woman!

62
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,880
Fujiko-san, this concerns you too!




63
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,530
Because of your exploits at the World Championships,

64
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,890
you might be recommended for the All-Japan Judo Championships!

65
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,540
Please! They're not going to consider me!

66
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,400
Come on, your pork cutlets are getting cold.

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,750
B-But...

68
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,900
This place has really tasty pork cutlets!

69
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,600
These eyes didn't deceive me!

70
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,450
That heiress came strutting out, just as I predicted!

71
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,460
I hope I recorded that.

72
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,360
You must fight me directly and fairly.

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,460
Yep! There it is! There it is!

74
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,150
Even Yawara must've felt something after seeing that.

75
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,470
It's a bit of a shame she put on a better show than me,

76
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,350
but you did well, young lady.

77
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,940
We'll finally have our long awaited, destined rematch at the Judo Championships.

78
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,440
Label: Huge Knockers! Calling All Sluts!#

79
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,320
Dammit!

80
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,890
That broadcast aired so suddenly that I taped over the jigglies I got from Gen-san!

81
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,790
Honami-san!

82
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,200
Honami-san, where were you these last ten months?

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,940
At least give us a hint, Honami-san!

84
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,760
Who is this "best coach in the world"?

85
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,130
You'll learn everything at the upcoming All-Japan Judo Championships.

86
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,670
What's the basis for your confidence?

87
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,130
Where's Kojiro-san?

88
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,640
Oh, All Sports News. It's been a while.

89
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,680
Where did that man go?

90
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
Is Yawara-san doing well?

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,980
Y-Yeah.

92
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,040
Then give her my congratulations on finding a job.

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm still in my third year of women's college.

94
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,410
She must be having a hard time navigating her way in the real world.


95
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,410
However, she won't be able to use that as an excuse when she loses to me.

96
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,620
Where's Kojiro-san?

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,740
Kazamatsuri-san? Where's Kazamatsuri-san?

98
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,940
Kazamatsuri-san left on urgent business.

99
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,630
He must be busy.

100
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,390
The future of the Honami Group is resting on his shoulders, after all.

101
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,880
Wait, Honami-san!

102
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,220
Hey, wait!

103
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,120
It's scary how confident and relaxed she is.</i>

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,730
It's as if she's grown a head taller.</i>








105
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,740
Kojiro-san, what the hell did you teach her?</i>

106
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,220
I haven't dealt with those tedious crowds for a long time.

107
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,910
You've done very well.

108
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,780
Um, Miss...

109
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,920
What is it, Tokunaga?


110
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,880
You mentioned that you are in your third year of college.

111
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,510
Wh-What did you say?

112
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,360
Why do I have to repeat a year?

113
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,580
Why am I still a second-year college student?!

114
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,300
Y-You haven't attended any of your classes or taken any tests!



115
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,480
Then use my money and fix it!

116
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,350
B-But Seishin Women's School is very strict about these things!

117
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,670
H-How could this happen?
 An elite like me repeating a year?

118
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,680
N-Now I really need to defeat her!

119
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,950
You've gone and ruined my perfect life, Inokuma Yawara!

120
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,060
Yawara-san!

121
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,560
So she left already?

122
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,570
I hope she didn't see that broadcast.

123
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,110
I need to mislead her somehow.

124
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,550
Kazamatsuri-san was with Sayaka-san.</i>

125
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:41,760
Matsuda-san is probably covering the Sayaka-san thing right now.</i>

126
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,410
Who cares about "battles"? Who cares about "feuds"?</i>




127
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,640
It's always "judo, judo" with them.</i>

128
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,510
Whether it's Kazamatsuri-san... or Matsuda-san.</i>

129
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,510
Kazamatsuri-san!

130
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,920
I'm very sorry.

131
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,390
I had some work to do.

132
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,180
I saw the TV.

133
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,180
Are you sure you should be here?

134
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,270
Goodbye.

135
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,060
Wait...

136
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,090
Don't throw me.

137
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,650
If you throw me over now, we'll again part ways misunderstanding each other.

138
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,560
We can still make it to our reserved table at that five star restaurant.

139
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,840
Yawara? She ain't come back yet.

140
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,140
She's probably out gallivanting somewhere with the rest of those Mitsuba girls.

141
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,400
That's strange.

142
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,400
She better savor her leisure time, 'cause it ain't gonna last.

143
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,400
Did you see Sayaka's broadcast?

144
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,280
Sure did. I even got it on video.

145
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,110
I wish I could've seen Yawara's face when that heiress called her out.

146
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,160
Here, have some pickled daikon.

147
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,910
Sure.

148
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,490
The upcoming All-Japan Judo Championships are gonna be exciting!

149
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,460
Still...

150
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,430
It won't matter if Yawara doesn't accept the challenge, dramatic as it may be.

151
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,930
Way ahead of you. I'm making doubly sure she accepts it.








152
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,930
Doubly sure?

153
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,900
I've just called up Yutenji, telling him my plan is guaranteed to make Yawara enter.

154
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,400
Coach Yutenji?

155
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,900
I told him to recommend Beanpole for the All-Japan Championships.

156
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,150
Fujiko-san?!

157
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,160
Is Yawara gonna let her best friend go by herself and take the full brunt

158
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,670
of Miss Sayaka's flaming animus?

159
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,390
At 4:40 PM...

160
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,100
Come and have some tea, Hanazono-san.
At 4:40 PM...

161
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,680
Come and have some tea, Hanazono-san.

162
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,710
No, that's... Okay, maybe a little.

163
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,930
Yoo-hoo, Fujiko-san?

164
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,170
I have black tea and coffee, even kelp tea.

165
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,310
Kelp tea, then.

166
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,950
I must say, you can tell this is a girl's apartment.

167
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,420
My place is all messed up.

168
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,610
Here I am at her place. Does that mean Fujiko-san...</i>

169
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
i-is inviting me to...</i>

170
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,620
N-No way.</i>

171
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,070
F-Fujiko-san would...</i>

172
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,410
never do that.</i>

173
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,630
She'd never invite me to...</i>

174
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,630
Hanazono-san!

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,700
Here, thanks for waiting.

176
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,520
Oh, Ito-kun! This is Yutenji from Saikai U!

177
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,240
I know it's not right leaving a message, but I have some good news!

178
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,980
They've accepted our recommendation that you compete in the All-Japan Judo Championships!

179
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,730
Huh?!

180
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:02,770
So that means...

181
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,230
Sign: Inokuma#
So that means...

182
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,520
So that means it's not just Yawara-san vs. Sayaka-san.

183
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,610
Dream match ups such as Sayaka-san vs. Fujiko-san

184
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,200
and Yawara-san vs. Fujiko-san are also possible!

185
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,660
This is beyond incredible!

186
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,420
W-Wait. You're using their friendship against them again!

187
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,160
I'll use anything to get what I want. Besides, this is for Yawara's sake.

188
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,220
But you'll make her feel trapped again!

189
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,440
Can you think of another way to get Yawara to compete?

190
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,220
Well...




191
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,270
Even you can't live without writing articles about Yawara, right?

192
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,230
By the way, Macchan, Miss Sayaka said something very interesting in that broadcast.

193
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,240
Who the hell is that "best coach in the world" who trained her?

194
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,700
Wh-Who knows?

195
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,110
Aren't you honest to a fault?
 I can read it all over your face!

196
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,980
You know, don't you? Who is it?

197
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,790
I-I don't know!
You know, don't you? Who is it?

198
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,640
Come on, spill it!

199
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,720
Who on God's green Earth has the cajones to claim they're a better coach than me?

200
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,520
Come on! Come on! Out with it!

201
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,790
I-I swear I don't know!



202
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,340
Oh, my. I see you two are bonding again.

203
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,390
I've brought some tea, Matsuda-san.

204
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,010
Yawara-san's mother!

205
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,060
Did you just come back?

206
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,330
Yes.

207
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,340
I heard rumors that Kojiro-san had been spotted in Jigokudani,

208
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,980
but once again I wasn't able to find him.

209
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,220
Just leave that prodigal son of mine alone.

210
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,530
Oh, Father.

211
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,700
I can't tell them.</i>

212
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,030
I could never tell them that Kojiro-san is Sayaka-san's coach.</i>

213
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,590
I'm going to the All-Japan Judo Championships?



214
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,760
It's not surprising.

215
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,970
It's obvious that they would nominate you.

216
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,790
They saw how you performed at the World Judo Championships.

217
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,880
B-But...

218
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,320
I can't wait!

219
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,810
I wonder how far you'll go against Inokuma and Honami?

220
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,310
I-I'll be competing against Inokuma-san?

221
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,150
Why?

222
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,450
The All-Japan Judo Championships are an open-weight tournament.

223
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,940
Like the name says, it decides who's the best in Japan.

224
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,450
It's very possible that you'll play against Inokuma.

225
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,930
I can't! I could never be a match for her!

226
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,910
No, from now on you'll have to take on all kinds of opponents.

227
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,170
You'll need to defeat people like Inokuma
 if you want to become a world-class player!

228
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,060
Now then, if you'll excuse me.

229
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,840
Huh? Can't you stay longer?

230
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,850
Nah, I still need to train.

231
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,350
What's going on, Hanazono-san?





232
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,310
You and Inokuma have done spectacularly in both the nationals and the world championships.

233
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,070
Compare to that, I'm...

234
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,530
I'm...

235
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,990
an utter disappointment!

236
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,580
Goodbye!

237
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
H-Hanazono-san!

238
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,560
Hey!

239
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,250
Hanazono-san?

240
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,980
Very lovely. You look perfect in that.

241
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,100
I'm so sorry.

242
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,450
You invited me to such a wonderful place and even bought me this dress.

243
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,910
Well, it <i>is</i> a special occasion,
 plus it's a token of my apology.

244
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,060
I don't blame you for being angry.

245
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,790
Not only was I late meeting you,
but I was also filmed with Sayaka-san.

246
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,150
When I was about to go to Mitsuba Women's College,

247
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,720
I ran into Sayaka-san.



248
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,960
She told me she was appearing on TV.

249
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,980
Of course she forced me to go along.

250
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,310
Oh, I know that doesn't amount to any excuse.

251
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,440
However, I'm in a tough position.

252
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,740
I'm on loan from the Honami Group as the coach for Seishin Women's School.

253
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,280
I'm never sure how to separate my work from my private life.

254
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,480
Look, it's all right.

255
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,160
Does that mean you forgive me?


256
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,290
If I hadn't, I wouldn't be here with you now.

257
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,300
Thank you.

258
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,000
Here is your Meursault.

259
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,410
Vintage 1978, correct?

260
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,320
Of course.

261
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:00,810


262
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,600
Here's to you graduating from college,
