1
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,020
I don't care if it's a Yuko or a Koka!

2
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,990
Just get those points and evade!

3
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,820
Please, at least tie!

4
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,240
Paddyfield!

5
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,340
Ippon!

6
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,340
They're really France's top-class team!

7
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,950
She did it!

8
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,520
Kyonkyon's Deashi Barai!

9
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,720
Oh, no!

10
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,280
That's a choke hold!

11
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,330
Well, well.

12
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,730
You really are my students.

13
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,240
You really are the nation's top team.

14
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,450
Gotta admire those guts!

15
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,880
I wanna see more of that in the next two matches.

16
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,600
We will now begin the fourth match!

17
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,390
Please, forget about me and have fun out there, Yoshinagawa-san.

18
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,560
Don't strain yourself. Just have fun, okay?

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,570
Yeah...

20
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:01,740
I... must've lost three kilos while waiting for my turn.

21
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,750
Thank God I'm Fat!

23
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,480
MWJC can't come back from one win and two losses.

24
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,810
Yeah, you know who's gonna win this fourth match.

25
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,930
That team wasn't going to win unless Inokuma took out all five.

26
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,110
Listen!

27
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,280
Prost specializes in taking down an opponent with a Maki Komi followed by a Newaza!



28
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,930
Loosen up your shoulders and go!

29
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,720
Sayuri, don't be afraid!
 There's nothing to be afraid of!

30
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,980
Okay.

31
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,110
No matter how you look at it, we aren't going to win.</i>

32
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,000
Yawara-san's transfer to Saikai University is a foregone conclusion.</i>

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,190
That being the case, I must think about how to make her mine.</i>

34
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,490
Hey, Kazamatsuri!

35
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,740
Don't just stand there. Cheer for her!

36
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,170
Cheer for her? We know how this match is going to end.

37
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,840
We won't know till it's over!

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,140
Y-You don't have to win! You can just tie!

39
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,550
Yeah, if you tie, then our captain Fujiko-san will win it for us!

40
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,370
That's right!


41
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,470
If we get two wins and two losses, we'll do a tie-breaking match.

42
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,310
That way, Inokuma will get to play again.

43
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,080
That means I mustn't lose under any circumstances.



44
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,350
A-Anyway, don't lose!

45
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,750
R-Right.

46
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,290
Sayuri-san?

47
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,780
Don't worry about my job.

48
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:27,790
Just don't get hurt and have fun, please.
Don't worry about my job.

49
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,570
Just don't get hurt and have fun, please.

50
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,630
Inokuma-san.

51
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,130
I'll lose weight by playing this match, right?

52
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,180
I might be able to wear size 11 clothes!

53
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,820
Mm-hmm! I'm sure you will!

54
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,450
So I'll wear size 11s!

55
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,890
Vice Captains, forward!

56
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,790
Go on!

57
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,140
Please don't lose!

58
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,640
Sayuri-san...

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,890
Listen up, Prost.

60
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,670
Yawara Inokuma's team is taking this practice match very seriously.

61
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,530
So we must treat this like an official competition.

62
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,110
Oui.


63
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,370
Her glare alone is making me lose weight!

64
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,720
She's huge!

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,100
They're both big, but they're far from being equally talented.


66
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,210
This is simply not a fair fight.

67
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,020
S-So this is where it ends, Master?

68
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,180
Yep. At long last we'll put a stop to her shilly-shallying.

69
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,530
Really, I've waited... for such a long time!

70
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,330
Finally... Finally...

71
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,190
Yawara-san will join our Saikai University judo team!

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,890
We're going straight to Barcelona!

73
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,660
Then we're making a beeline to the gold medal and the National Achievement Award!


74
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,120
What just happened?!

75
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,490
Sir, calm down!

76
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,550
How am I supposed to calm down?!

77
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,420
There's no way in hell she's going to win!

78
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,380
And when she loses, we'll lose Inokuma Yawara!

79
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,490
Sir!

80
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,910
Don't lose! Don't you dare lose!

81
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,640
Hajime!


82
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,890
Don't fight her directly!

83
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,230
Pull back!

84
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,900
She's done for!

85
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,400
Yuko!

86
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,940
That was close.

87
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,870
Get away! She's going for an Osaekomi!

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,010
Stop!

89
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,870
Mate!

90
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,000


91
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,350


92
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,360
That was close!

93
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,190
It's only a matter of time.

94
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,260
Don't get close to her!

95
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,540
Waza Ari!

96
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:00,810


97
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:00,870
She's going for another Osaekomi!


98
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,650
She's going for another Osaekomi!

99
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,110
Wrap your legs around her!

100
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,760
Good!

101
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,390
Don't let go of that leg!

102
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,650
Don't you dare!

103
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,980
Ah! She's getting free!

104
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,120
O-Oh, no!

105
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,250
She's free!

106
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:20,830

She's free!

107
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,130


108
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,460
Mate!

109
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm finished! 

110
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,960
All right!

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,870
That was great, Sayuri!

112
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,560
You're amazing!

113
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,020
B-But she's still...
You're amazing!

114
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,310
She's still no match for her.

115
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,410
Give it a rest!

116
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,820
Call it off. We know who's gonna win!

117
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,590
Sir, she's down by a Yuko and a Waza Ari!

118
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,280
I-It's all over!

119
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,060
It's finally happening, Master!

120
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,480
Did you think of a clever quip to say at the press conference, Yutenji?

121
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,330
Hajime!

122
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,820
Please do something!


123
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,130
We don't care if it's a fluke!

124
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,010
Oh, no! If she keeps pulling back, her opponent will force a move!

125
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,440
A Sumi Gaeshi? 

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,060
She's finished!

127
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,270
And next she's going for her specialty, the Newaza!

128
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,520
Her Sumi Gaeshi couldn't withstand her weight!

129
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,500
And she landed right on her face. That's gotta hurt.

130
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,670
Ow...

131
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,720
Inokuma-san! Can't she do a, you know, a Something Shihoh Gatame!

132
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,800
Maybe you can maintain that position!

133
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,230
Grab her tightly between your legs!

134
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,230
Don't get up! Just keep clinging to her!

135
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,840


136
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,600
Grab her collar and tighten your hold!

137
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,170
Osaekomi!

138
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,710
What the hell's that?

139
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,410
Give it up!

140
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,360
Master! It might be by chance, but if she pins her head with her large body...




141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,000
She's completely helpless.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
What tenacity she has!

143
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,370
Don't get up!

144
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,460
Just lie there!

145
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,570
Please, don't let up!

146
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,430
Don't let go even if it kills you!

147
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,350
Fifteen seconds in!

148
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,230
Twenty seconds!

149
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,610
Grab her tighter!

150
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,420
Twenty-five seconds! It's now a Waza Ari!

151
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,450
Don't let her go!

152
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,660
Only three more seconds!

153
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,700
Two!

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,660
One!

155
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,820
Ippon!

156
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,670
Done!

157
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,470
All right!

158
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,670
Sayuri won!

159
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,620
She won!

160
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't believe it.

161
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,690
Sir, it's now tied at two wins and two losses!

162
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,100
Yes! If the next player doesn't lose,

163
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,650
Tsurukame Travel will be hiring Inokuma Yawara!

164
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,290
That fight was <i>très bon</i>.

165
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,650
I truly underestimated Master Jigoro's judo.

166
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,660
Sayuri-san!

167
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,620
I wonder if I can fit into size 11 clothes now?

168
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,650
Mm-hmm!

169
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,730
It's tied 2-2!


170
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,350
This contest is ours now!

171
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,470
You really kicked butt out there, Sayuri!

172
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,090
You were wonderful, Sayuri-san!

173
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,550
Did I really lose weight?

174
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,220
You sure did! We even lost weight by watching you!

175
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,820
You can even wear skintight clothes.

176
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,350
Right, Yawara-chan?


177
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,050
Yeah. We'll go shopping later.

178
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,070
All right! We'll have a huge victory bash after the match!

179
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,770
But she'll just gain the weight back!

180
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,950
What'll we do? It's the last match now!

181
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,390
And the captain is our very own Ito Fujiko!


182
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,510
Knowing how good she's become, what if they... actually win?!

183
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,070
Bah, enough of this!

184
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,280
I'll just have to play my last card.

185
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,740
You did it! You did it, Sayuri!

186
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,990
You were wonderful, Sayuri-san!

187
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,490
You've lost weight!

188
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,940
This is a practice match. Just finish it!


189
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,520
I want to go to the Inokuma Yawara press conference the old man promised.

190
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,050
Still, don't you think both teams are strangely fired up for this?

191
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,580
Yeah, now that you mention it. And it's only a practice match.




192
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,450
It's just as you reckoned!

193
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,410
Both teams are super serious about this match!

194
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,420
You all knew the Mitsuba team didn't have a tinker's chance of winning this!

195
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,490
However, if their captain,
 Ito Fujiko, wins her match,

196
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,440
they upset the best team in France!

197
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,930
Why ain't y'all covering such a gripping match?

198
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,410
I've witnessed their ceaseless perseverance with my own two eyes.

199
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,520
Here they are, persevering...

200
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,940
They're the very definition of "perseverance"! I'm so moved!

201
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,640
S-Say, that <i>is</i> a good story.



202
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,450
The Japanese are suckers for that kind of thing.

203
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,390
Good! Now get out there and root for them!

204
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,350
And don't forget your cameras!

205
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,830
Master, what are you saying?

206
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,970
I'm still wondering about Inokuma Yawara's press conference,

207
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,420
but this match might be bigger than I thought!

208
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,510
Hey, wanna leave?

209
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,570
My butt's starting to get cold.

210
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm famished.

211
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,870
Ho there, Mitsuba College ladies!

212
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,960
It appears that you're getting bored.

213
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,200
That's because we don't know what they're doing out there!

214
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,820
What a blessed, blessed shame,

215
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,350
considering what a darn good match we have here.

216
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,450
We're talking about a life-or-death struggle!

217
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,870
Life?

218
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,870
Or death?

219
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,210
They're tied 2-2, and it's all riding on the last match!

220
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,920
Master!

221
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,090
So it's a close competition?

222
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,350
You got it! You college girls are pretty sharp!

223
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,430
Master!



224
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:36,390
Your senpai, Ito Fujiko, is right now itchin' to fight for that victory.

225
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,950
This sounds like it's no longer a joke.

226
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,110
If Ito Fujiko wins,

227
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:50,800
this match will be on tonight's sportscasts and in tomorrow's sports papers.

228
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,910
You gonna miss out cheering for them?

229
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,990
This might be on TV!

230
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,280
So this is why all those reporters are here!


231
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,960
They might even film us!

232
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,170
Now then, let's get rolling!

233
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,400
Hurray! Hurray! Fu-ji-ko! C'mon!

234
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,180
Hurray, hurray, Fujiko! Hurray, hurray, Fujiko!

235
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,900
Very good!

236
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,180
Keep it up, but make it <i>loud</i> this time!

237
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,600
Hurray, hurray, Fujiko! Hurray, hurray, Fujiko!

238
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,350
Good! Very good!

239
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,420
Master!

240
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,660
Master, have you given up on
 Yawara-san's transfer to Saikai U?

241
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,470
Sir, shouldn't we join them?

242
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,410
Oh, yes!

243
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,710
Hurray, hurray, Fujiko! Hurray, hurray, Fujiko!

244
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:54,480
Hurray, hurray, Fujiko! Hurray, hurray, Fujiko! Hurray, hurray, Fujiko!

245
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,650
Wow, everybody's getting excited!

246
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,640
Now you really gotta show 'em, Fujiko-sa—

247
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,910
Fujiko-san.

248
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,200
A-Are you okay, Fujiko-san?

249
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,300
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

250
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:34,960
I-I have t-to do some s-stretches.

251
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,230
It's all part of Master Jigoro's scheme.

252
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,360
Fujiko-san can't stand a lot of pressure.

253
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,640
The fact that Yawara-san's job depends on her match has already made her nervous.

254
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,550
And now, the auditorium is filled with people cheering her name,

255
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,000
for some strange reason.

256
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,790
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

257
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,250
Fujiko-san must be a complete nervous wreck.


258
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,520
You amaze me, Master Inokuma Jigoro.

259
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,660
Wh-What is this?

260
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,020
So she's just as scared
 of the spotlight as you are?

261
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,930
Yes, I know very well how she feels!

262
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,850
If it weren't for my stage fright, I'd be on the Olympic team now!

263
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,310
Don't bring up that subject!

264
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,950
Dammit, how low will that geezer go?!

265
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,920
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

266
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,980
Fujiko-san.

267
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,490
I-I'm all right, I-Inokuma-san!

268
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,930
D-Don't... w-worry about me!

269
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,820
I-I w-will.... d-definitely win!

270
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:12,940
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!
I-I w-will.... d-definitely win!

271
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,820
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

272
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,150
Look, their captain fought Teleshikova evenly at the World Judo Championships!

273
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,450
Be careful, Moréchand!

274
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,260
Oui!

275
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,070
Their captain, Moréchand,

276
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,040
placed third at the European Championships in the 72 kg heavyweight class.

277
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,650
She's a rising star in French judo!

278
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,010
She specializes in the Sukui Nage and the Ura Nage,

279
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,930
pretty much any power move.

280
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,790
Wh-Who cares? Fujiko-san still has her Uchi Mata and Ouchi Gari!

281
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,040
Y-Yeah! She still has her Nutcracker and Swan Lake!

282
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,190
Hold on.

283
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,760
Ouchi Gari!

284
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,660
Uchi Mata!

285
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,190
Go in there flying!





286
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,690
They already know...

287
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,510
...all of Fujiko-san's moves.

288
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,890
Ouchi Gari!

289
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,580
Moréchand!

290
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,190
Ouchi Gari!

291
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,320
Uchi Mata!

292
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,420
We will now begin the final match!

293
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,330
You can just tie, Fujiko-san!

294
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,420
Inokuma will win the tiebreaker match!

295
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,130
I-I'm okay!

296
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,590
I-I'll b-be sure to win!

297
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,140
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!
I-I'll b-be sure to win!

298
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,590
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

299
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,870
Fujiko-san.

300
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,350
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!
Fujiko-san.

301
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,870
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

302
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,100
What'll we do? Everybody's cheering for her!

303
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,290
Just watch.

304
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,750
Please win, Fujiko!

305
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,790
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!
Please win, Fujiko!

306
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,750
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

307
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,690
I-I'll win.</i>

308
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,800
Inokuma-san, I'll win!</i>

309
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,230
You're looking for your father?

310
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,810
Yeah.

311
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:19,370
I might find some leads on my father if I worked at a travel agency.

312
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,830
Inokuma-san, you can count on me. I will win!</i>

313
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,290
Hajime!

314
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,940
Fujiko-san, don't directly engage her!

315
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,210
She'll try overwhelming you with a power move!

316
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,420
Watch out for her Ouchi Gari and Uchi Mata!

317
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,800
I'll win! I <i>will</i> win!</i>

318
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,270
Fujiko-san, relax and be more flexible!

319
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,070
Fujiko!

320
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,700
Jougai! Mate!

321
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,540
She's not only powerful, she's fast too!

322
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,240
Fujiko-san.

323
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,500
I'm scared!

324
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,970
Fujiko-san! Loosen your shoulders! Relax!

325
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,730
You can just tie!

326
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,770
Don't be rash!

327
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,610
It's no good! She's too fixated on her match to hear us!

328
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,730
Fujiko-san!

329
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,700
Watch out!

330
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,740
A Kata Guruma!

331
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,410
Yuko!

332
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,920
Mate!

333
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,910
She's powerful!



334
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,930
She can toss Fujiko around anywhere!

335
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,500
She's strong.

336
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,890
She's too strong!

337
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,630
Fujiko-san.

338
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:40,030
That Nervous Nelly ain't beating such a powerful opponent.


339
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,600
We're finally settling things here!

Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 187 Days#


341
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,130
Yawara, things ain't looking good for Beanpole, and she's your last hope.

342
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,740
Well, you're wrong! Fujiko-san, that's the way!

343
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,580
Relax and do your "un, deux, trois" like usual!

344
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,320
Oh, so she's grown some spine, has she?

345
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,370
Fujiko-san, once you have the lead, keep away!

346
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,870
If she just keeps away,
 she'll only get beat eventually.

347
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,090
Yawara!

348
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,620
Get That Ippon and Win!
