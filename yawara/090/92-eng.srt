1
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,300
A match for their...

2
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,980
...graduation?

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,270
That's when I made my decision.

4
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,900
If the MWJC team wins the graduation match,

5
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,000
you can go to Mud Turtle Travel, Monkey Crab Travel, or wherever you want.

6
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you, Grandpa!

7
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,010
If you lose, we're beating you into shape at Saikai U.

8
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,340
Okay!

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,390
Oh, this place is buzzing.

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,740
We found an opponent for you.

11
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,130
Huh?
We found an opponent for you.

12
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:03,310
We found an opponent for you.

13
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,320
The opponent for your graduation match!

14
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,270
I went and found a team after Gramps asked me to.

15
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,230
You did?

16
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,690
France's Seine University's women's judo team.

17
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,840
They have Moréchand, the European champion.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,620
Put her together with Deneuve, the World Judo Championship third-place finisher,

19
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,740
and you have the best team in France!

20
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,350
The pieces are all in place.</i>

21
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,550
All that's left is for everything to go according to my detailed plan.</i>

22
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,350
Revealed! The Ultimate Conspiracy



23
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,360
I sincerely apologize for my grandfather's rudeness.

24
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,130
Oh, please. You don't need to apologize.

25
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,320
That's right.


26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,940
It's your grandfather who's at fault!

27
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,240
He's a grumpy, eccentric—

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,210
Dummy!

29
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,430
Sorry.

30
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,330
Anyway, we should have been a little more prudent in our approach.

31
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,040
Are you still willing to employ me?

32
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,090
Yes, of course.


33
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,640
Thank goodness. I'm not too late.

34
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,260
Forgive me, but there has been a change in the situation.

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,520
What?!

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,530
S-So what you're saying is...

37
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,730
if your team wins this "graduation match," you'll be able to work for us?

38
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,990
Yes. My grandfather says he'll allow it.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,880
Hurray! Hurray!

40
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,010
Wait! Nothing is settled yet!

41
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,340
I'll try as hard as I can, though.


42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,580
Come now, Inokuma-san!

43
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,210
With your talent, this match is as good as won!

44
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,430
So Tsurukame Travel has finally snagged Inokuma Yawara-san?

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,640
This is a real come-from-behind Ippon win!

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,830
Oh, that's very clever, sir!

47
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,570
Yeah, hello?


48
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,080
I'm about to give you TV guys a juicy tip.

49
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,210
Me? I'm Inokuma Jigoro.

50
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,840
What? "Inokuma who"?

51
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you a wannabe newsman?

52
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,850
Next Sunday, after Inokuma Yawara wraps up her graduation match,

53
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,800
I'll be holding a high-falutin' press conference.

54
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,300
Be sure to bring your TV cameras!


55
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,960
You can also bring those cake boxes too!

56
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,020
The best team in France?

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,070
Yes, and that numbskull Matsuda-san was the one who arranged something so stupid!

58
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,180
I swear to God!

59
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,030
It's as though you want to drag her down.

60
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,580
You've always been a few monkeys short of a barrel.

61
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,160
Even at that, stupidity has its limits.

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,370
If she loses this match, her chances of employment will go down the drain!

63
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,010
What'll you do if that happens?

64
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,160
There's no point in criticizing him.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,580
But he...

66
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,690
Matsuda-san, don't worry about it.


67
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,650
Grandpa wouldn't have let me compete against a weak team in any case.

68
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,200
I-I'm sorry.


69
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,200
Come on, everyone! Let's practice!

70
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,290
Sh-She's right! This is no time to stand around!

71
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,560
Inokuma is going to go all out, so we need to help her any way we can!

72
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,170
Yes! No matter how good our opponent, Inokuma-san will pull through for us!

73
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,770
All right! If that's the case, I'm practicing till I drop!

74
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,480
We're going to make tonight count. 

75
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,590
Go! Go!



76
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,260
Practice, practice!
Go! Go!

77
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,880
Practice, practice!

78
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,910


79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,920
Pull harder!

80
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,790
Yes, right there!

81
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,240
Okay, now pull!

82
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,980


83
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,160
Faster!

84
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,960
Yes, right there!

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,820
Right!

86
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,960
Trois!

87
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:46,990
There!

88
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,010
That's right!

89
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,540
Keep it up!

90
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,510
She's serious.

91
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,970
Yawara-san is seriously fired up.

92
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,720
I have to do this. I have to do this!</i>

93
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,940
What kind of press conference?

94
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,940
Come and see for yourself!

95
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,570
Your sports paper had better save space on the next day's front-page headlines.

96
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,200
Anyway, this is gonna be big news!

97
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,950
Also, bring some of those cake boxes!

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,810
That should be just about all the news outlets.

99
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,890
All that's left now is to wait for the big day.

100
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,310
Mud Turtle Travel ain't getting her!

101
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,770
Yawara, go ahead and practice all you like.

102
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,400
That's right!

103
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,820
We have to win this!

104
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,950
Now, what do you think of this strategy?

105
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,070
The first player should be...

106
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,310
Yawara-chan.

107
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,580
That way we can kill their momentum.

108
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,540
If you can take out all five, all the better.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,460
Yeah. A perfect plan, if utterly pathetic.

110
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,550
It's a flawless strategy!

111
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,050
But... guys?

112
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,890
Also, you're going to face the best team in France, right?

113
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,600
If, by a one in a million chance you should slip up with one...

114
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,610
If that happens, I...

115
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,360
along with Kyonkyon and Sayuri, will knock her around and wear her out.

116
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,290
I'll be competing too?

117
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,330
I'll probably lose weight just waiting for my turn!

118
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,330
And!

119
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,870
Our very own trump card, Fujiko-san,
 will finish off that worn-out opponent!

120
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,420
M-Me?

121
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,760
Yes, it could work.

122
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,880
This way, we're sure to win the match!

123
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,880
Right?




124
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,890
Though as long as Yawara-chan keeps on winning, I can't foresee any problems.

125
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,850
But... all of you were looking forward to this graduation match!

126
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,400
It's okay. Please defeat every single one of them.



127
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,910
Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun in this circle.

128
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,950
She's right! Win five in a row and join Tsurukame Travel!

129
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,210
Everyone, thank you.

130
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,150
Wait a second.


131
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,270
Where do I come in?

132
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,240
Anyway, the four of us can take care of one opponent if needed.


133
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,620
All right! This match is as good as won! Let's go all out!

134
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,900
Yeah!


135
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,930
When do I get to play?

136
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,320
Say, what kind of press conference are we having?

137
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,780
Dunno.

138
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,890
In any case, we can't ignore an Inokuma Yawara match.

139
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,070
Say, have you ever seen a judo match?

140
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,270
No, I haven't.

141
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,860
I wonder if there'll be fights outside the ring?

142
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,940
Hey, you brought the cake boxes?

143
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,360
Yeah. If that old geeze says to bring them, you'd damn well better.


144
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,370
I've handed in the player roster!

145
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,830
Can't you find a different outfit?

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,420
But this is what today's cheerleaders normally wear!

147
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,610
Race queens, for example!

148
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,800
Still, you know this will attract media attention.

149
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,430
We're the best in the nation!

150
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,930
Please, don't do any idiotic cheering in that outfit.

151
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,470
Kabamatsuri!
Note: "Kaba" means hippo.#

152
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,690
Coach Polnareff, it's been a while.

153
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,150
And it's "<i>Kaza</i> matsuri."

154
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,520
How is Sayaka doing?


155
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,420
Huh? Uh, oh...

156
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,610
Anyway, let's go meet Yawara-san.

157
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,320
Oh, Yawara.

158
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,130
You have an amazing intensity, Yawara.

159
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,260
It's a pleasure to meet you.

160
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,230
So you're serious about this, Yawara?

161
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,860
You had a very determined look in your eyes, Yawara.

162
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,740
I'm honored that you're taking this practice match seriously.

163
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,690
My team will also be playing seriously.


164
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,850
They don't have to be serious at all!

165
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,090
I'm scared!

166
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
That's Coach Polnareff for you.

167
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,600
It looks like he sensed how determined you are to get that job.

168
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,370
I have to say you've really screwed up, Matsuda-san.

169
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,970
You didn't have to pick such a good team

170
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,980
for a match that could determine her employment.

171
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,980
Oh, that's right!

172
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,950
You'd prefer that Yawara-san go to Saikai University, wouldn't you?



173
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,990
It would make for more exciting judo and more exciting articles.

174
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,700
Th-That wasn't my...

175
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,310
Well, Kazamatsuri may have a point.</i>

176
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,320
Deep down, I do want Yawara-san to attend Saikai U.</i>

177
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,330
Go ahead. Join that no-judo-team Tsurukame Travel.</i>

Inokuma-san.

180
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,220
Hey, it's almost time. Let's go.




181
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,050
Don't worry. I know you'll win, Yawara-san.

182
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,360
He's right! If our opponents are serious, then we'll be just as serious!

183
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,490
Yes! You'll win five in a row, Inokuma-san!

184
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,780
We're the best team in the nation!

185
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,310
Go! Go!

186
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,320
All right!

191
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,670
a knockout competition?

192
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,720
A point competition?!

193
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,220
Y-You tricked me, Gramps!


194
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,640
Sir, it looks like we made it!

195
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,170
Good.

196
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,440
Once Inokuma Yawara's team wins,

197
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,220
we'll tell the press that she's joining Tsurukame Travel.

198
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,690
Sounds perfect!

199
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,360
Make it happen, Inokuma-san!

200
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,330
That was rude, you know!

201
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,350
Here they are!

202
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,170
It's the Seine University women's judo team!

203
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,430
She's competing against <i>them</i> ?!

204
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,570
Th-They're here!

205
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,510
I-I'm scared!

206
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,970
Come at us any way you want!

207
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,220
We have Yawara-chan on our side!

208
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,420
That's right! That's right!

209
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,940
Right, Yawara-chan?

210
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,070
Um, everyone, listen.

211
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,610
About this match...


212
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,160
Line up!

213
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,120
O-Okay!

Grandpa!</i>

215
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,820
I'm not scared! I'm not scared!

216
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,610
It's better not to look them in the eyes.

217
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,230
We'll show 'em a thing or two!

218
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,180
We will now hold a practice match between Mitsuba Women's Junior College and Seine U.

219
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,820
Furthermore, today's match will be a point competition.

220
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,950
What?

221
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,050
What was that?!


222
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,160
Nobody told us this would be a point competition!

223
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,620
What's the matter, Hanazono-san?

224
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,500
Points or whatever, let's get this match started!

225
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,380
What are you saying?!

226
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,000
A point competition is not a knockout match!

227
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,470
He's right.


228
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,120
It's best three out of five matches from the first players down.

229
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,470
What'll we do?!

230
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,850
No! You can't do that!

231
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,480
L-Ladies, what's wrong?

232
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,520
I was up all night thinking out my strategy!

233
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:52,870

I was up all night thinking out my strategy!

234
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,060


235
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,990
Wait a minute. What exactly are you objecting to?

236
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,900
We're going to lose!

237
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,240
You won't know if you'll lose unless you play!

238
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,920
Believe me, we know!

239
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,050
She's right!

240
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,960
Hey, hey, what gives?
She's right!

241
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,800
Start already!

242
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,470
We're good if we can just see Inokuma Yawara compete!

243
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,620
Master, something weird's going on, apparently.

244
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,630
Honestly, nothing's happening with that bunch.

245
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,490
What are you all yapping about?

246
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,410
You birdbrains!

247
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,200
B-But it's not a knockout competition like you promised!

248
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,330
Promised? I don't remember making that promise.

249
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,170
You're the ones who told me to take care of <i>everything</i>, remember?

250
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,170
Yeah, but...

251
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,170
"Yeah, but" nothing!

252
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,800
Think what'll happen if the first French player wins against the five of you.

253
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,930
The other four French players will go home without even playing.

254
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,930
Yeah, but Inokuma-san will be the one to win five for us!

255
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,400
You think Yawara's guaranteed to win five?!

256
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:17,030
The honorable French team came all the way here to fight a pathetic bunch of girls like you.

257
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,910
I am greatly moved by their love for judo!

258
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,250
Now quit shilly-shallying and get started!

259
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,930
Any problems?

260
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,480
In that case, bow to each other!

261
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,470
This can't be happening.

262
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,200
We've been tricked.







263
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,910
This match is a plot devised entirely by Master Jigoro and Matsuda-san.

264
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,870
Master Jigoro never had any intention of letting you work, Yawara-san.

265
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,710
In addition...

266
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,830
Matsuda-san conspired against you because he really wants to see you go to Saikai U.

267
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,220
How could they do that?

268
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,800
They didn't have to go that far!




269
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,360
Matsuda-san! I am deeply devastated!

270
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,190
I can't believe you're that kind of man!

271
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,810
I'm also deeply devastated!

272
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,060
I knew you should have put me in.

273
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,070
What? Don't give me those evil looks!

274
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,700
Now then, we will conduct the first match.

275
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,030
First players forward!

276
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,580

Yawara-chan!

278
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm sorry, everyone.

279
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,990
Because of me, what was supposed to be a fun graduation match...

280
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,760
Who cares anymore? Let's just have fun today.

281
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,020
B-But...

282
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,720
Oh, my!

283
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,300
Inokuma's going first!

284
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,920
Who's she facing?

285
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,120
That's Vartan.


286
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,910
She finished third in the 72kg-and-unders at the European Championships!

287
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,660
We already have the main event!


288
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,990
Still, this is cruel! So cruel!

289
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,870
They can actually do that?

290
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,240
I'm scared!

291
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,670
I'm losing weight!

292
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,670
Hajime!

293
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,130
Master Jigoro, you didn't have to go this far!

294
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,590
Matsuda-san, I thought you were decent!

295
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,940
Ippon!

296
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,690
Done!

297
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,000
M-Master, did you see that?

298
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,910
Yeah!

299
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,490
I've seen her Ippon Zeoi before, but this one was the best by far!

300
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,370
Yeah, that gets a passing grade!

301
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,840
T-Très bien!

302
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,650
Inokuma-san!

303
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,840
Yawara-san!

304
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,550
That was outstanding! Simply electrifying!

305
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,840
See? So let's have fun.

306
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,140
B-But...

307
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,770
Second players forward!

308
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,350
Y-You... You mean me?

309
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,360
I-Isn't that...

310
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,820

Deneuve specializes in the Uchi Mata!

Please...

315
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,600
