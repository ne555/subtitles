Hello, everyone. This is Oshiuri Sports Station.
Nameplate: Tegome Hiwatari#

4
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,990
Today we have a special guest.

5
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,980
It's the grandfather of the headline-grabbing superstar of female judo, Inokuma Yawara.

6
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,960
Seventh-degree judo black belt—

7
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,090
I'm an eight-dan!

8
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,470
No young'un can beat me even today!

9
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,840
Yes, eighth-degree black belt, Inokuma Jigoro-san.

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,650
I have to say, I'm very impressed.

11
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,230
You have the gold medals from both the Seoul World Cup and the World Championships.



12
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,610
These things are just tin toys to me,

13
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,200
compared to the gold medal we'll get in Barcelona next year.

Oh, that Khuruchin girl?
TL note: His mispronunciation sounds like "exposed penis" in Japanese.#

20
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,920
Yeah, she finally pulled off a good Ippon Zeoi.

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,590
Nothing like what I've seen her do in her other matches.

22
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,990
Still, I'd rather see a Bon dance or an Awa festival than what she was doing there.

23
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,180
That bubbleheaded mental case.

24
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,180
Who are you calling a bubblehead?

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,710
Speaking of Bon dances, Kaneko and I used to go to those a lot.

26
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,490
Whenever Kaneko puts on her yukata,

27
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,780
she's so beautiful I'd swear she's the
 reincarnation of the Goddess of Mercy herself.

28
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,240
Um, getting back to Yawara-san...

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,580
You think she compares to that Hyottoko-like girl?! 

30
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,210
Kaneko was far and away the prettier one.





31
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,140
W-We're talking about Yawara-san, not Kaneko-san.

32
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,460
You must be burning with passion as you prepare for the Barcelona Olympics.

33
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,220
Of course! The pure love Kaneko and I had for each other was very passionate!

34
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,170
But our pure passions weren't the only things burning.

35
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,820
Back when I won my first national championship,

36
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,730
I wanted that second title so badly nobody could beat me—

37
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,090
I beg you!

38
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,230
Please answer my questions about Yawara-san's prospects at the Barcelona Olympics!

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
Oh, yeah!





40
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,240
That word "Olympics" takes me back.

he's become even stronger!



50
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,420
This month's round-robin contest brought out the strongest men in the nation,

51
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,370
but they're no match for him!

52
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,550
All right! Who's next?

53
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,120
Have you all lost your nerve?

Hi!

Were you the one yelling like a madman?

I came to Japan because I heard judo was the toughest form of fighting in the world.

59
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,780
But everybody was weak.

Very well. If you wish to challenge me, I accept.

65
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,660
I won't hold back.

Judo can't be won by mere strength.

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,690
Great! Strong! I will become your pupil!

80
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,190
Pupil?

81
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,190
Yes!

82
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,440
You moron! You wanna be my pupil despite your puffed-up attitude?

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,780
Lemme go, you bad-mannered galoot!

84
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,090
Oh, my teacher!

85
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,190
Don't cuddle me with your hairy body!

86
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,580
I hate men!

87
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,030
I already have a fine fiancée named Kaneko-san!

88
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,660
Lemme go! You wanna get thrown again?!

89
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,640
I think it's okay, Jigoro-san.

90
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,790
Wow!

91
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,510
He came all the way from America. Let him be part of the dojo.

92
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,940
B-But, Kaneko-san...

93
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,510
Kaneko?

94
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,380
Oh, wonderful, beautiful Yamato Nadeshiko! Fujiyama geisha!

95
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,770
Very happy, my new teacher! You lucky dog, you!

96
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,270
You Debeso bastard! I'll teach you how to be respectful!

97
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,480
Thought you could get away with that, huh?






98
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,610
Wait a minute. Davis? An American named Davis?

99
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,120
Where have I heard that name before?

100
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,120
Please!


101
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,830
Hey, I'm still on my fifth bowl here,
 but a layabout like you is on your seventh?

102
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,090
I swear, you don't know any manners!

103
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,090
Oh, Teacher, you said,
 "Appetite commands the strong."

104
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,060
Idiot! It's the flexible that commands the strong!

105
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,100
Still, I can't believe that an American like you would enjoy my rice this much, Davis-san.


106
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,050
Your cooking is very good, Kaneko.

107
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,890
It fills me with boundless, manly vigor.

108
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,320
I thought I told you judo isn't based on strength.

109
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,930
If I was able to defeat 650 bears, then you know it takes skill!

110
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,170
I also took down giant Canadian grizzlies!

111
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,120
Those bears were just the appetizers!

112
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,490
The time I did an Ippon Zeoi on a man-eating whale in the Sea of Haneda was quite a feat!

113
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,300
Oh yeah, I made its tail fin into sashimi. The marbling on it made it extra tasty!




114
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,470
The smoked meat I made out of a mammoth I took down in Alaska was delicious!

115
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,310
You should've had some of that, Teacher.

116
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,190
Mammoths are too disgusting to eat!

117
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,150
The eggs of the dinosaur I caught in Naruto Strait were rare delicacies!

118
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,500
Kaneko-san.



119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,500
I-Is this another Great Kanto Earthquake?

120
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,100
Kaneko-san, I'm right here! Don't worry!

121
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,780
Debeso?

122
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,330
Good morning, Teacher!

123
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,100
Come on. Let's do our morning training together!

124
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,280
He ain't gonna be peppy for long.</i>

125
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,940
He can't possibly keep up with my harsh training.</i>

126
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,610
He's gonna crawl back to America crying bitter tears.</i>

127
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,240
Jigoro-kun!

128
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,240
What about Debeso?



129
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,210
You won't believe who Arnold Davis is!

130
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,140
Of course he's unbelievable!

131
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,750
That layabout eats ten bowls of rice, breaks the door lintel,

132
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,210
wrecks the hallway flooring, and is a lying blowhard to boot!

133
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,960
That's not what I mean!

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,470
I found out the real story about him in my newspaper archives!

135
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,470
The real story about Debeso?




136
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,930
Yeah, that guy you threw to the ground...

137
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,170
is the king of heavyweight wrestling!

138
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,340
Note: Squid rings.#
Ika rings?

139
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,950
Wrestling!
Note: Squid rings.#

140
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,130
Well, it's like a Western style of judo.

141
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,620
No wonder he doesn't get exhausted, no matter how hard I make him work.

142
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,990
He's wearing iron sandals and is doing a hundred bunny hops up and down these stairs.

143
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,120
Nobody else in my dojo can keep up with me.

144
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,620
Only that Debeso can keep up.

145
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,460
All right! Two hundred uchikomis!

146
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,930
Put your hips into it! Your hips!

147
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,600
I don't care if it's wrestling or Röntgen, he's still got a lot to learn.</i>

148
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,120
Did you do the 200 uchikomis?

149
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,430
Yes, all finished! I'm starving!

150
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,610
You still have ten years before you can lay a paw on an Ougiya mame daifuku.

151
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,120
I want to try one!





152
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,910
When you beat me, then you can have one.

153
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,370
Ougiya mame daifukus are simply heavenly!

154
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,330
Yet another thing I want.

155
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,670
You know something just as good as an Ougiya mame daifuku?

156
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,680
Gold medal! The gold medal!

157
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,970
Are those as delicious?

158
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,630
I'm entering the Berlin Summer Olympics this year!

159
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,980
I want an Olympic gold medal!

160
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,980
Olympics? Is that a food too?

161
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,030
No!


162
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,940
The Olympics is a big sports festival where the best players in the world compete.

163
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,700
If you win, you become the best in the world and get a gold medal.

164
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,900
What? The best players in the world compete?

165
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,700
I never got an invitation.

166
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,130
They don't recognize judo yet.

167
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,750
But judo is amazing! I'm sure judo will become an Olympic sport soon!

168
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,740
If they don't have judo, how can anyone claim to be the best in the world?

169
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,010
Now let's go do some randori!

170
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,340
Who needs the Olympics? Who needs gold medals?

171
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,820
I hope it fits you, Davis-san.






172
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,120
Oh, a yukata! Wonderful!

173
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,580
That was a good bath!

174
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,080
Now then, Kaneko-san, let's go see the fireworks.

175
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,830
Thank goodness. It fits perfectly.

176
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,170
Nice! Very good!

177
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,950
Debeso! Time to see the fireworks—

178
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,840
Thank you, Kaneko! Very, very thank you!

179
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,140
You're banished!

180
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,330
Sign: Kyudou-kan Dojo#

181
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,950
Listen, Jigoro-kun!
Sign: Kyudou-kan Dojo#

182
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,080
When foreigners kiss like that,

183
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,860
they're just showing their deep, platonic affection for others.

184
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,920
You didn't have to...

185
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,980
That Debeso bastard!

186
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,990
He kissed my fiancée even though I've never kissed her!

187
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,920
I'll never forgive him!

188
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
Next!

189
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,560
He's been practicing here all alone ever since that day.

190
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,610
He won't listen to reason, and neither will Jigoro-kun.

191
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,380
Ever since Davis-san left,
 our house has felt really empty.

192
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Well, I'm relieved because I don't have to deal with that royal pain anymore.

193
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,940
Bad news!

194
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,950
Bad news! Jigoro-kun, this is bad!

195
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,700
What's with all the noise?!

196
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,700
Davis-san is by the river, fighting the guys from the Ryuudoukan and Mumyoukishinryuu dojos!

197
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,170
What?!

198
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,800
Debeso!

199
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,900
He's nuts!




200
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,800
Even Debeso can't win if he's outnumbered!

201
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,810
Debeso! Are you all right?!

202
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,810
Debe—

203
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,270
Hi!

204
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,360
D-Debeso.

205
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,150
Don't be so damn proud over beating a bunch of weaklings.

206
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,750
Note: He's referencing a battle during the Sengoku Period (1467-1600).#
I tossed 2,000 Imagawa soldiers in a row when I trained in Okehazama.

207
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,750
Oh! Well, I took out an army of 5,000 Indians in Mexico!

208
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,500
That's all you did?

209
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,020
Back when I secluded myself in the mountains of Hidatakayama,

210
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,760
I tossed 10,000 abominable snowmen all the way to the moon!

211
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,950
Back in Arizona, I threw 20,000 aliens and their UFOs back to Mars where they came from!






212
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,980
I'm leaving Japan tomorrow to go to the Berlin Olympics.

213
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,770
So this is where we say goodbye.

214
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,590
Who gives a damn about Berlin or its Olympics?

215
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,630
You can do your horseplay over there for all I care!

216
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,730
Jigoro-san!

217
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,660
Now then, let's have a match before you go off to your little festival.

218
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,290
A match?

219
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,400
It won't be a pupil against his "teechur." It'll be a serious, man-to-man fight.

220
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,040
You'll be playing for mame daifukus.

221
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,050
Jigoro!

222
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Let's go!

223
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,060
Come at me any way you want!




224
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,790
Don't let your guard down, Jigoro-kun.</i>

225
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,060
This is not the old Davis you're facing.</i>

226
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,790
My God! Such intensity!

227
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,040
They've been fighting for almost three hours.

228
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,940
What's wrong, Debeso?

229
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,160
All you've been doing is shouting!

230
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,050
Where's the power that brought down a mammoth?

231
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,060
What happened to the strength you used to do an Ippon Zeoi on a whale, Jigoro?

232
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,320
Whales are just kappa farts!

233
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,140
When I was training in Nara, I pulled an Osoto Gari on the Great Buddha

234
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,560
and an Okuri Eri Jime on the Five-Storied Pagoda!

235
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,690
Back when I was training in New York, I felled the Empire State Building

236
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,700
and made the Statue of Liberty cry uncle!

237
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,590
Oh, no! Get away!






238
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,510
He's got it!

239
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,520
That ain't nothing, Debeso!

240
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I had a much harder time bringing down Mt. Fuji!

241
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,260
This fight's not over!

242
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,900
Back when I defeated Niagara Falls,
 it was a total come-from-behind victory!

243
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Davis, give up! Your arm will get busted!

244
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,870
Quit being stubborn and give up, Debeso!

245
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,580
This ain't over by a long shot!

246
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,830
Davis?

247
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,920
It ends here.

248
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,960
No!

249
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,970
We don't know who won! Let's fight!

250
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,460
You won't be in any festive mood if your arm's all bandaged up!

251
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,970
Now get going to your Olympics!

252
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,230
However, you're still not getting any Ougiya mame daifukus.

253
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,230
Jigoro.

254
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,570
One day... One of these days we'll play judo in the Olympics.

255
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,290
When that happens, we'll have our judo match! I promise!

256
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,660
Good! We'll see whether I take the gold medal

257
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,060
or if you get to eat mame daifukus!




258
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,520
Go, Maehata! Go, Maehata!
Ice

259
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,710
Maehata, go, go, go! Go, Maehata!

260
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,520
Maehata's fast! She's got the lead!

261
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,740
Go, go, go, go! Go, Maehata!

262
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,370
Maehata Hideko wins! She won! She won!

263
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,240
She did it! She becomes the first Japanese woman to win a gold medal in swimming!

264
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,150
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

265
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,220
This is the 11th Olympiad in Berlin. We will now announce the results of the other events.
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

266
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,200
This is the 11th Olympiad in Berlin. We will now announce the results of the other events.

267
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
In the heavyweight freestyle wrestling championship match,

268
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,430
we had the American Davis vs. Palusalu of Estonia.



269
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,290
The Estonian Palusalu won the match on a judge's decision!

270
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,480
Debeso lost.


271
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,530
He fought me to a draw.

272
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,850
I've tossed more than a hundred good athletes, but he still lost.

273
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,730
Y-You see? Some incredibly talented people compete at the Olympics.

274
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,690
That can't be!

275
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,190
Horse hockey!

276
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,750
Who gives a damn about the Olympics or the gold medal?

277
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,240
Without judo, how can you tell who's the best in the world?!

278
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,630
I ran. And I kept running, and running, and running.

279
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:35,710
Finally, I threw that giant Estonian way up into the Berlin skies

280
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,150
and put the world in a state of shock!

281
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:45,140
The cheers and applause I received lasted more than three days and three nights.

282
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,990
Jigoro is number one! Jigoro is number one!

283
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,190
Because of my brilliant achievement, judo became an Olympic sport,
Jigoro is number one! Jigoro is number one!

284
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,230
Because of my brilliant achievement, judo became an Olympic sport,

285
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,230
and they decided to hold the next Olympics in Tokyo!








286
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,220
You're obviously lying!

287
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,820
You saying I'm lying?

288
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,280
You couldn't have run all the way to Berlin!

289
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,630
Berlin was closer in those days.

290
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,050
However, despite my efforts,

291
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:20,800
the 1940 Tokyo Olympics were canceled two years later.

292
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,050
The Second Sino-Japanese War had turned into a quagmire.

293
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,800
Life was getting uglier and more militaristic.

294
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,300
Headlines: Imperial Declaration of War
Western Pacific Battles Begin#
Life was getting uglier and more militaristic.

295
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,810
Finally, we plunged ourselves into that disastrous war.

296
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,360
There were no Olympics for thirteen years after that,

297
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,780
so I wasn't able to keep my promise to Debeso to fight him on the world stage.

298
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,530
But the amazing judo skills I displayed in Berlin became the talk of the world,

299
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,710
and in 1964 the Olympics were finally held in Tokyo.

300
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:03,050
Judo became an Olympic sport,
 and it spread throughout the world.

301
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,500
So the fact that there is judo today is all thanks to me!






302
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,030
I already heard that on TV!

303
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,260
Honestly, how much of it is true anyway?

304
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,190
At least you've matured into a real wisenheimer.

305
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,880
If you boiled the grime from under my fingernails and drank it,

306
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,470
you'd be able to win one, maybe two gold medals in Barcelona! 

307
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,940
I'd rather die than drink that!

308
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,350
All right, the tea is ready.


309
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,740
I also have Grandpa's favorite—

310
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,030
What do we have here?

311
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,830
I really wanted Debeso to eat these.

312
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,240
Ougiya mame daifukus, even if they've become much smaller.

313
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,930
Yawara.

314
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,740
After watching my moving story, you're all fired up to get that gold medal, ain'tcha?

315
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,800
Actually, not really.

316
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,140
No, no, I know what you're trying to say.

317
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,660
That's 'cause I'm the one who knows you best.

318
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,900
You don't know me at all!

319
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,220
I want to work for Tsurukame Travel!

320
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,130
You still trying that runaround on me?

321
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,480
You know I ain't gonna allow that!

322
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,310
Yawara!

323
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,790
Next Up, The Graduation Match!
