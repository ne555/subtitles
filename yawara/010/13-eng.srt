1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,150
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,600
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,850
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,400
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,450
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,850
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,350
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,970
Yawara!

10
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,310
How long are you going to keep 
meddling with them, you big fool!

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,300
You have a big tournament awaiting you!

12
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,490
Inokuma-san, what did you just say?

13
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,770
Yawara will be in a big tournament real soon.

14
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,050
And prove that she's number one in Japan!

15
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,260
I'm not going to be in that tournament.

16
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,510
See? Now there's no problems!

17
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,140
Yawara-san, will you really do it?

18
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,090
To be our coach?

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,860
What?

20
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,960
You want me to be the judo club's coach?

21
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,280
Episode 13
Yawara's Heart Shook in Hayama!

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,490
U.. unbelievable! This is supposed 
to be the first-class meal?

23
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,090
This poverish thing?

24
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,440
W... well, I think this is about the best you'll get.

25
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,200
See, there's even caviar.

26
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,900
This sad caviar wouldn't even be 
touched by my dog, Charles.

27
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,930
Tokunaga! Don't touch it!

28
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,020
To have a Hon'ami servant eat such crud would bring shame to every generation!

29
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,660
O... of course, Miss.

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,900
That's why I hate to utilize 
the commercial airlines.

31
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,190
I can't believe that my personal jet broke
down right when I wanted to fly home.

32
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,540
When I get home, I'm going to ask my
daddy to buy me a new plane.

33
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,830
Don't anybody move!

34
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,310
I'll kill anyone that moves!

35
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,030
D.nn don't tell me it's a hijacker!

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,010
Oh yes! I should get a Concord this time,
huh, Kazamatsuri-san?

37
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,550
I'll throw Inokuma Yawara in 
the next tournament,

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,790
... and in the Concord, I'll go around the world!

39
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,560
Of course, you'll come with me, Kazamatsuri-san!

40
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,430
S... Sayaka-san, be quiet!

41
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,150
What's wrong?

42
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,920
Don't move. You don't wanna die, right?

43
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,540
Who is this grubby man?

44
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,160
Be quite, Sayaka-san!

45
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,500
So, you wanna die, eh?

46
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,690
So, you wanna die, eh?
What a mean looking pistol.

47
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,930
What a mean looking pistol.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,230
Sayaka-san!

49
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,540
It has to be a toy, for sure.

50
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,980
It has to be a toy, for sure.
Victim number one!

51
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,300
Victim number one!

52
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,460
Sayaka-san!

53
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,550
Sayaka-san!
Hey!

54
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,260
Hey!

55
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,810
What a pathetic hijacker!

56
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,750
Well, it could be that I was
just too strong, though!

57
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,610
Bravo!

58
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,040
Amazing! What sharp skills!

59
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,100
Maybe in the upcoming tournament..?

60
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,830
You threw a hijacker, right, Sayaka-san?


61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
One comment, please!

62
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,370
Weren't you scared?

63
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,590
Kazamatsuri-sama, aren't you coming?

64
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,240
Are you watching, Yawara-san?

65
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,130
Next time, it'll be you!

66
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,800
I am not my old self anymore.

67
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,880
I'll throw you so far into the air so
I won't have to see you anymore.

68
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,610
I... I can't believe it!

69
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,180
Are you ready, Yawara-san?

70
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,640
That Miss Sayaka sure is good 
at being flashy, as usual.

71
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,010
This is not even funny! 
She's getting on my nerves!

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Oh come on, this is how it's 
supposed to be, Yawara.

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,050
Use that anger in the upcoming tournament!

74
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,490
I told you, I'm not gonna be in that!

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,950
You can't fool my eyes, Yawara!

76
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,130
Despite what you say, your eyes tell me
that you're burning up inside.

77
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:20,350
I'm just mad.. at people like Sayaka-san 
and you, trying to make me do judo!

78
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,370
Seconds of kimpira goboh, please!

79
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,040
Sure.

80
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,670
Hey, are you listening?

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Grandpa!

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,730
Another bowl of nameko miso-soup!

83
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:33,750
And so, the place will be the National 
Martial Arts Hall, with national TV 
coverage provided by Oshiuri TV.

84
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:40,450
And so, the place will be the National 
Martial Arts Hall, with national TV 
coverage provided by Oshiuri TV.
The First Oshiuri TV Cup Judo Tournament
Official Press Conference

85
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,270
I am extremely delighted to 
announce this glorious event!

86
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,700
That was the tournament board president, Coach Yuutenji's comments.

87
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,060
And, as a feature, we will have a special 
guest perform a model demonstration 
before the start of the tournament.

88
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,290
Everyone, please welcome Inokuma Jigoro,
8th degree black belt!

89
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,420
I'm 9th degree!

90
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,010
That attention-hog gramps!

91
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,800
Uhh, uhh, testing..

92
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,240
Uhh, uhh, testing..
Fix it, he's 9th degree!

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,650
Fix it, he's 9th degree!

94
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,420
I'm Inokuma Jigoro, Jya! I'm still strong enough to take on you young ones!

95
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm Inokuma Jigoro, Jya! I'm still strong enough to take on you young ones!
Umm, you're a bit too close to the mike...

96
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,500
Umm, you're a bit too close to the mike...

97
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,220
Although I'm still physically able
to do a tournament...

98
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
... please forgive me for just doing that exhibi-whatever for you guys.

99
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,460
In place of me, my granddaughter, Inokuma Yawara, will probably astonish you!

100
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,540
So, she is going to be there!

101
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,680
Finally, in an official tournament!



102
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,790
Yawara will surely win! 
With all ippon victories, too!

103
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,430
Umm, master, we were going to announce entrants right after you...

104
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,520
Coach Yuutenji! There's a rumor that Hon'ami Sayaka is signed up for this tournament, too..?

105
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,480
It's true.

106
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,880
Thought so!

107
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,100
You, too? The whole program's out of whack!

108
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,780
Her determination to be in this
tournament is awe-inspiring.



109
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,370
She's already in Hayama, training in preparation for this event!

110
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,400
Inokuma 9th degree, is there anything 
special about Yawara-san's training?

111
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,400
My training is special every day.

112
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,590
Special every day? What type of training is it?



113
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,020
That is..

114
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,200
That is..?

115
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,030
A secret, Jya!

116
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,160
W... well, I shall announce the entrants now...

117
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,450
Okay, now we need to go interview
Inokuma Yawara in person!

118
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,060
Hurry!

119
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,410
Matsuda-san, we should hurry and 
go to Yawara-san's place, too...

120
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,020
Matsuda-san? Matsuda-san!

121
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,210
Matsuda-san? Matsuda-san!
Umm, the entrants are...

122
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,110
Umm, the entrants are...

123
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,010
Hurry! Hurry!

124
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,880
If Yawara-san is surrounded by the media again, she'll probably refuse to participate!

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,550
I won't let that happen!

126
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,770
Yawara-san, this time, 
you'll have to get serious!

127
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,830
Everyone, fight --

128
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,330
Oh!

129
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,940
Fight --

130
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,330
Oh!

131
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,710
Fight --

132
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,050
Oh!

133
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,180
B... beautiful!

134
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,030
The sunshine, glistening your beads of sweat!

135
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,070
Your beautiful voice, echoing in
the school grounds!

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,710
Even if we forced you into it, I never 
thought that you'd be our coach!

137
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,490
Had I not broken my leg, I would've 
run with you and trained with you!

138
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,590
You fell in love with her, too, huh?

139
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,950
Y... you're that, Daily Every Sports'...

140
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,230
Matsuda.

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
Sorry, but she can't waste her 
time doing this petty thing.

142
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,990
Petty thing? She's our official judo club coach!

143
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,600
That's why it's a petty thing.


144
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,280
H... hey, wait, you!

145
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,870
Okay. Let's do 3 laps of rabbit hops
around the school next!

146
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,560
What? That's impossible!

147
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,380
Yawara-san!

148
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,850
Hurry up, the reporters will mob you soon.

149
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:49,900
Hurry up, the reporters will mob you soon.
Reporters?

150
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,570
Reporters?

151
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,900
At the official press conference, your entry
into the tournament was confirmed.

152
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,760
At the official press conference, your entry
into the tournament was confirmed.
Tournament?

153
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,830
At the official press conference, your entry
into the tournament was confirmed.

154
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,540
What?

155
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,180
Come on, let's go!

156
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,450
Hey, what are you doing?

157
00:09:59,450 --> 00:09:59,700
Hey, what are you doing?
Y... Yawara-san!

158
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,560
Y... Yawara-san!

159
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,400
Th... that jerk! What are you 
gonna do with Yawara-san?

160
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,540
Hold it!

161
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,060
Ha... Hanazono-san!

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,140
You mustn't chase her!

163
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,940
But, Yawara-san said she wasn't
going to be in the tournament...

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,440
Idiot!

165
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,420
B... but..

166
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,800
Bear with it. You must bear it.

167
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,090
Yawara-san isn't ours. She is a person destined to shine in Japan's judo world!


168
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,460
Quit acting cool, you dork!

169
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,660
With Yawara-san gone, what'll happen 
to this wimpy judo club, huh!

170
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,860
Let me off! Let me off!

171
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,320
I don't want to be in the tournament!

172
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,670
Nope. You'll have to fight this one.

173
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,750
No way! I won't!

174
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,670
Listen up! You are the savior 
of Japan's sports world!

175
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,160
You just made it that way!

176
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,650
Be more aware of your situation.

177
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,270
You're unbelievably strong. 
Put that talent to good use!

178
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,550
No! If I do judo, I can't wear pretty clothes!

179
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,950
You can wear pretty clothes 
after you do an ippon zeoi.

180
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,250
Cooking, too!


181
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,080
After winning a national tournament, 
all your food can be eaten.

182
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,770
Who said anything about eating?

183
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:20,850
Who said anything about eating?
What? What did you say?

184
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:20,900
What? What did you say?

185
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,070
What? What did you say?
I want to learn how to cook!

186
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,480
What? What did you say?

187
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,150
Anyway, I want to fall in love normally,
and become a bride someday.

188
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,730
Even if you get a gold medal in the Olympics...

189
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,660
... you can still have a wonderful love life... 
and be a normal bride, too.

190
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,720
What will be so normal about
a strong bride like that?

191
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,210
Let me off! Just let me off!

192
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,150
Kidnapper!

193
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,140
Watch it, watch it.. c'mon, it's dangerous!

194
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,550
Stop.. it!

195
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,000
All right then.. if you're gonna be that stubborn, let me show you something!

196
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,570
What? Where are we going?

197
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,480
To Hayama!

198
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,030
What?



199
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,210
Thank you very much.

200
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,760
Is she done yet?

201
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,680
How is the waist?

202
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,040
It fits just fine.

203
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,370
Oh, it looks wonderful!

204
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,120
Can I get this?

205
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,820
Sure, whatever.

206
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,000
How much is it, miss?

207
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,980
Okay. Thank you very much.

208
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,680
Oh man, geez. And it's before my next pay, too.

209
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,860
I'm so jealous! You're giving her a present! You're so lucky to be with such a nice boyfriend!

210
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,960
Wha.. that's not it.. we're not like that!

211
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,560
Huh?


212
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,740
W... well, I guess we are, huh?

213
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,280
Not at all!

214
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,170
Wow! Hey, is this someone's extra mansion?

215
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,180
Don't be surprised with that. Over here!

216
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,960
Wow, there's even a pool in the inner garden!

217
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,410
Oh yeah! There they are!

218
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,050
There! Look closely, Yawara-san!

219
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,050
Running in the sand with steel sandals...

220
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,760
... and dragging a giant tire..

221
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,760
This is Hon'ami Sayaka's rigorous training!

222
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,980
Fight, fight!

223
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,470
50 more meters!

224
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,880
Who do you think that fashionable
miss is doing that for?

225
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,740
Yawara-san, it's to fight you!

226
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,130
That's it, Sayaka-san!

227
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,860
Sayaka-san!

228
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,290
You don't feel anything after seeing this..?

229
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,620
Kazamatsuri-san..

230
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,070
Wha..?

231
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,340
Yawara-san, hey.. what's wrong?
You've been so quiet.

232
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,310
Yawara-san..

233
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,610
Yawara-san.. you're thinking 
of Kazamatsuri, aren't you?

234
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,990
H... hey, don't ride the bus! 
I'll take you home on my bike!

235
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,350
Yawara-san! Yawara-san!

236
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,130
H... hey! Do you have any money?

237
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,350
Darnit, geez, take my wallet!

238
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,880
Heh.. it's none of my business.

239
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,440
She's just news material.

240
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,190
And, she's only in high school.. 
she's 7 years younger than me.

241
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,220
She's still a kid.. a kid!

242
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,530
It's none of my business who
she likes and stuff.

243
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,530
I just want her to perform 
well in judo.. that's all..

244
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,820
It it's an interview, please leave.

245
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,100
I'm not gonna interview, looking like this.


246
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,650
Could I borrow some money?

247
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,510
My bike died on me, and I can't get home.


248
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,230
Wha... what is this?

249
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,800
Oh, please don't get near this thing.

250
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,030
Don't talk to her like I'm a germ!

251
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,090
My gosh, does your newspaper not give 
you any money for interviewing?

252
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,220
Excuse me. I lost my wallet for some reason.

253
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,220
Here, this should be enough, right? 
Please leave immediately.

254
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm really sorry.. to borrow 
your shower and clothes.

255
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,600
And on top of that, some money, too. 
I'll return it to you ASAP.

256
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,340
There's no need for you to return it. 
Just don't come before us again.

257
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,050
No, I will definitely return what I borrowed.

258
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,430
Well, excuse me.

259
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,710
Oh yeah, Inokuma Yawara might 
not be in the next tournament.

260
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,470
What?

261
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,330
Wha.. what did you say?

262
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,300
She had no intention of fighting
in the first place.

263
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,410
Even in the last practice match, 
I practically forced her into doing it.

264
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,280
That's preposterous! Then what 
is all our training for?

265
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, there is a way to convince her to fight...

266
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,000
What should be done?

267
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,290
Oww..

268
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,730
It's Kazamatsuri Coach.

269
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,290
What about Kazamatsuri-san?

270
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,590
There's someone attracted 
to Kazamatsuri Coach...

271
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,930
Don't say that in front of Sayaka-san!

272
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,020
Who is attracted to Kazamatsuri Coach?

273
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,690
Him! He likes me!

274
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,980
Hey, let's talk outside, alone.

275
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh.. oh really? Is that so? Oh, I see!


276
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,030
I thought so.

277
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,040
Yawara-san feels for me.. I see!

278
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,270
Aren't you happy.

279
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,780
D... don't kid me! She's still in high school!

280
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,880
Hon'ami Sayaka is a high school girl also.

281
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,930
Huh? Don't tell me you think there's something going on between me and her?


282
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,070
Well, with your reputation, it's harder 
to think that nothing's going on.

283
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,880
You're only aggressive with women, right?

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,610
Only if you could've used that 
aggressiveness in judo matches!

285
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,160
What do you mean by that?

286
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,530
I'm saying that, had you used your 
girl-chasing energies in judo matches...

287
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:27,760
You could've won at least the Nationals,
you nervous freak!

288
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,670
I don't chase girls.. they just become
attracted and come to me.

289
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,890
It's the girls that want me, just like Yawara-san.


290
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,380
Ahh, this is so stupid!

291
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,110
I wanted to ask you, but I changed my mind.

292
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,820
It was stupid of me to think 
of asking you anyway.

293
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,680
H... hey wait! What were you 
going to ask me to do?

294
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,830
Jesus! How could Yawara-san
fall for such a jerk!

295
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,640
Oh, I know!

296
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,930
Yawara-san will listen to what I say..

297
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,800
You wanted me to ask her to be 
in the tournament, right?

298
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,020
I'll do it!

299
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,960
No! Don't get near her!

300
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,170
Don't worry, I can do it!

301
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,740
Don't worry, I can do it!
Inokuma Yawara!

302
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,830
Inokuma Yawara!

303
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,680
That model demonstration for that tournament.

304
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,290
Should I go with this?

305
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,190
That was excellent, Father.

306
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,890
Tamao-san, you're here?

307
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,470
That was wonderful. I can watch it 
for hours without getting bored.

308
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,250
Right, right?

309
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,750
Maybe I should prolong my demonstration time.

310
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,900
The audience would be so happy, they'll be moved with tears in their eyes!

311
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,190
Of course! If you do great, it'll encourage Yawara to do even better!

312
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,990
But, where is Yawara? Where is she...

313
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,900
Skipping practice, that delinquent girl!

314
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,180
It's Yawara.

315
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,650
That stupid child!

316
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,090
Yawara! What's wrong, Yawara?



317
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,390
We waited for you to eat dinner together.

318
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,180
I made your favorite -- doria!

319
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,110
Eii, Yawara! The tournament date's real close!

320
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,430
Hurry up and change into your judo outfit.


321
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,670
Today's doria has some tasty shrimps in it!

322
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,230
It's shrimps, Yawara! Shrimps!

323
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,030
Today's practice is uchi mata sukashi!
uchi mata sukashi -- inner thigh reaping throw slip

324
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,410
The uchi mata sukashi, Jya!
uchi mata sukashi -- inner thigh reaping throw slip

325

Kazamatsuri-san..

327
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:24,050
915 days to the Barcelona Olympics

328
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,010
Yawara, why are you spacing out?

329
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,870
Practice, child, it's time for practice!


330
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,000
What? Kazamatsuri-san has 
something to tell me?

331
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,410
Why in the world..?

332
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,520
Eii, Yawara! You're still
mumbling over that guy?

333
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,800
But, Kazamatsuri-san is with Sayaka-san..

334
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,230
But.. but when he looks into my eyes, I..

335
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,520
But.. but when he looks into my eyes, I..
I won't allow it!

336
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,000
I won't allow it!

337
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,300
I won't allow it, Yawara!

338
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,890
Next time, on "Yawara!" ...

339
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,210
Yawara's Date Has So Much Surveillance!

340
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,810
