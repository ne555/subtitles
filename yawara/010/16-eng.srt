9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,130
I will.. be in.. the next tournament!

10
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,510
I want to find out if I shine 
brilliantly when I do judo.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,010
Just this time.. I'll do it.

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,190
Hmph, then I can soon make it clear
that I'm Number 1 in Japan..

13
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,470
... in front of everyone in Japan..

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,790
..in two weeks, at the National Martial Arts Hall!

15
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,410
Episode 16
Yawara's National Martial Arts Hall Debut!

16
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,200
The First Women's Judo Oshiuri Cup

17
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,690
How long is this going to last?

18
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,380
Hurry up and start the matches!

19
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,350
Dammit, the model demonstration is
supposed to be only for 5 minutes!

20
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,820
It's already over 30 minutes now!

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,880
I... Inokuma-sensei, your time's up! 
Please stick to the schedule!

22
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,230
Who's the fool that got the gramps 
to do the opening ceremony?

23
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,810
Splendid! He did it!

24
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,890
Ah, screw it! Forget him.

25
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,720
We'll edit him out later, 
so don't tape him anymore.

26
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,910
Isn't Inokuma Yawara here yet?

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,910
It's almost time, too.

28
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,970
Yawara-san.. isn't ditching 
this tournament, is she?

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,290
Players' Waiting Room

30
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,000
Players' Waiting Room
Wh... what? Inokuma Yawara isn't here yet?

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,040
Wh... what? Inokuma Yawara isn't here yet?

32
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,840
I entered this tournament to fight her.

33
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,680
I will beat her this time!

34
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,620
Next!

35
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,850
Judo is power and intensity! Which is why I gained 10 more kilos [22.5 lbs].

36
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,150
It's so noisy! That's why I hate shared rooms.



37
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,360
M... Miss, please bear with it 
just a little while longer.

38
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,730
Tokunaga, go find another waiting room.

39
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,620
I don't want to be with a she-gorilla.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,420
What did you say?

41
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,050
Who are you calling a she-gorilla?

42
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,500
Oh my, what a large face.

43
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,100
What did you say?!

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,020
You're saying gibberish about 
fighting Inokuma Yawara...

45
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,140
... but you won't be able to do that.

46
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,270
Do you understand, TODO-san?
TODO -- sea cow

47
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,400
It's Tohdoh!

48
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,340
No matter how much you win, you're 
going to fight me in the semi-finals.

49
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,170
So why won't I be able to
fight Inokuma Yawara?

50
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,360
You're dumb, aren't you?

51
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,030
In the semi-finals, I'm going to defeat you.

52
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,670
I will fight Inokuma Yawara in the finals.

53
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,030
How dare you brag!

54
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,540
Oh, it's the truth.

55
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,060
Tokunaga, the coat's dirty. 
Give me another.

56
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,070
Y... yes!

57
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,580
Is this.. no.. this.

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,220
Don't you forget about me!

59
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,190
I won't forget, TODO-san.
TODO -- sea cow

60
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,680
It's Tohdoh! I'll crush that 
snobby face of yours!

61
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,740
With an already crushed-up face like yours,
I guess you have no worries.

62
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,130
What did you say?

63
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,590
What are you doing, Yawara-san?

64
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,100
Listen, Hatakeyama-kun, your left arm 
pull is rather weak, so be careful.

65
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,750
Listen, Hatakeyama-kun, your left arm 
pull is rather weak, so be careful.
National High School Tournament, Tokyo District Preliminaries

66
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,030
Listen, Hatakeyama-kun, your left arm 
pull is rather weak, so be careful.

67
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,030
Tomioka-kun, don't get intimidated. 
You need to glare back at them, too.

68
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,240
That's good enough, Inokuma. Now go 
to the National Martial Arts Hall.

69
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,810
Y... yeah. If you don't hurry, it's gonna start.

70
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,390
But..

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,750
Don't worry. They absorbed everything 
you've taught. Right?

72
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,940
Oh!
Oh -- yeah

73
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,880
I... Inokuma.. I.. I'm extremely delighted!

74
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,530
The reason why these guys have such 
brave voices is because you gave
them the confidence they needed!

75
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,160
It's not all my doing.

76
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,980
The limo has arrived! Yawara-chan, 
hop on! I'll take you to the station.

77
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,990
Well then.. I'll go.

78
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,780
Yeah. Do your best, Inokuma.

79
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,570
You'll surely become Number 1 in Japan.

80
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,380
Fight, Yawara-san!

81
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,080
Do your best!

82
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,180
And win!

83
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,660
You guys do your best, too. You'll surely win.

84
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,610
As soon as I finish my matches,
I'll come back. See you!

85
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,600
Hang on tight. I'll go full throttle!

86
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,270
Everyone, do your best, okay!

87
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,040
Inokuma.

88
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,150
You'll.. you'll definitely win.

89
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,750
And.. you'll become an unreachable superstar.

90
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,640
That's good. It has to be that way.

91
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,890
Inokuma!


92
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,260
Sudoh-kun, listen. Since Hanazono-kun
has a broken leg...

93
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,900
...everyone is depending on you today.

94
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,260
I know. Anyway, hang on tighter.

95
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,920
Okay.

96
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,760
Yahoo!

97
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,410
Geez! Don't be so reckless!

98
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,390
Y... yes.

99
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,230
But.. I think of you differently now, Sudoh-kun.

100
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,660
I never thought you'd do judo so seriously.

101
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,460
W... well, that's because you're the coach.

102
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,030
Hey, Sudoh-kun, promise me.. that you 
won't use judo in fights anymore.

103
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:25,390
Of course not! How could I ever use the judo that you taught me, Yawara-chan, in fights!

104
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,780
Promise me!

105
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,470
I already did!


106
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,950
Hey.. that's Sudoh.

107
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,310
Heheh! Found something fun!

108
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,740
Well, Yawara-chan, do it right!

109
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,500
Long time no see, eh, Sudoh?

110
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
O... oh, hi.

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,910
Riding a bike with a girl.. ahh, youth!

112
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,840
I... I'm in a hurry, so..

113
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
Don't ignore us!

114
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,680
W... what are you doing?

115
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,710
Why you..! Don't act like you 
didn't do those things!

116
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,100
Wha... what things?

117
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,960
Doing those things to Yoshikawa-san's 
girl, Shimazaki's girl, and even my girl! 
And still you deny it, huh?

118
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,860
Wh... what are you saying? 
I didn't do anything! I didn't!

119
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,870
Quit lying!

120
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,890
Players' entrance!

121
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,290
It's Inokuma Yawara!

122
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,700
Inokuma came!

123
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,520
She came!

124
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,620
She came!

125
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,170
She has come!

126
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,570
Excuse me, please let me through.
I need to change.

127
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,640
Umm, the locker room is..

128
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,220
Over here!

129
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,460
A spectacular show! It's nice and dramatic 
to have the big player come last.

130
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,480
G... Grandpa.

131
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,030
So, shall we go get it.. the status 
of being Number 1 in Japan!

132
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,860
Y... You jerks!

133
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,860
How dare you take advantage of me.. 
because I don't fight back!

134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,480
Don't use it for fights, okay?

135
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,850
Yawara-chan.

136
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,960
What's wrong? Weren't you gonna throw me?

137
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,910
You guys aren't worth it.

138
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,810
What?

139
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,790
Hey, Sudoh..

140
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,490
You really want to..

141
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,590
DIE, don't you?

142
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,490
Hanazono-san, what happened to Sudoh?

143
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,830
Players' Waiting Room

144
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,000
Players' Waiting Room
That idiot is probably trying to pick 
up on some girls somewhere.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,050
That idiot is probably trying to pick 
up on some girls somewhere.

146
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,410
Sudoh!

147
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,040
As promised, I didn't use judo for fights.

148
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:20,990
Sudoh, what's wrong? Hey, get up! Hey!

149
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,810
The first round has begun.

150
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,540
What? What did you say?

151
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,250
Yuhkoh!
Yuhkoh -- partial 5 points

152
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,730
Calm down and explain it slowly. 
What happened to Sudoh?

153
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,680
W... well, Sudoh was battered by his 
old sempai or whatever.. and...

154
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,740
Hanazono-san and Kohno took him 
to the doctor's office now, but..

155
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,480
But, if Sudoh-kun doesn't fight, you guys 
can't do the 5-on-5 team matches!

156
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,570
You guys will lose by default!

157
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,170
Wh... what should we do, Yawara-san?

158
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,610
There's nothing I can do..

159
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,910
Doctor's office

160
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,750
Doctor's office
I can't do anything about it.

161
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:10,830
I can't do anything about it.

162
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,760
So, he can't do any judo matches now?

163
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,740
Are you kidding? He needs to be 
stabilized for quite a while.

164
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:26,220
He fractured his left arm, chipped 3 teeth, 
and has a severe concussion.

165
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,630
You big, fat, lumbering idiot!

166
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,690
You big, fat, lumbering idiot!
H... hold it!

167
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,300
You big, fat, lumbering idiot!

168
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,330
Y... Yawara-chan..

169
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,710
The fourth match is between Fujisawa Kumi, 2nd degree, and Inokuma Yawara, 1st degree.

170
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,120
Yawara-san, where did you go?

171
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,520
Geez, she's such a pain in the butt!

172
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,590
Okay, calm down. I'll go there as 
soon as I'm through here.

173
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,220
What are you doing?

174
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,040
Wh... wha..?

175
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,170
Wh... wha..?
You're up next! The match!

176
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,390
You're up next! The match!

177
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,040
Y... Yawara-san? Yawara-san?

178
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,000
This is not the time to do such things!

179
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,520
You don't have time to be 
on the phone right now.

180
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,320
But..

181
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,400
But, schmut! You have a match to do!

182
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,240
But, it's a serious situation now!

183
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,680
It's serious over here, too.

184
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,710
Now go!

185
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,650
I'm doing a match in this.. big place?

186
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,690
Come to think of it, this IS the 
National Martial Arts Hall.

187
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,010
I came here for concerts before, but..

188
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,590
But, I never imagined that I'd be standing here!

189
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,010
She's finally come to fight me!

190
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,580
She has finally come.. to fight me!

191
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,100
You're gonna lose to me in 
the semi-finals and cry!

192
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,990
Oh-hohohoh! It's you that's going to cry.

193
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,110
Though your crying face wouldn't
be too cute anyway.

194
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,320
You gotta stay calm, Yawara-san.

195
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,470
Main table, main table.

196
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,720
I'm going to get comments from 
Inokuma Jigoro-sensei about his granddaughter's first official match.





197
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,910
One comment, please.

198
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Don't get riled up just over this.

199
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,660
Don't get so excited over
this cheap, little match.

200
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,750
Yawara has the gold medal and the National Achievement Award waiting for her, you...

201
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,470
Th... that's it for now! Back to you, main table!

202
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,580
Stay calm, Yawara-san!

203
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,330
Just do as you always do!


204
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,350
That's true. I can't waste time here.

205
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,240
I need to hurry back to the judo team.

206
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,800
Inokuma's opponent is the 52-kg 
weight class All-Japan champ...

207
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,260
Fujisawa Kumi, 2nd degree.

208
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,500
Bow!

209
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,810
What intensity! Maybe I should lose.. then
I could go to everyone's place quicker..

210
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,410
You shine most brilliantly when you do judo.

211
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,690
Okay.

212
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,520
Begin!

213
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,380
I.ippon! 
Ippon -- full 10 points, a win

214
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,180
A... awesome!

215
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,430
How strong! Inokuma Yawara
is truly invincible!

216
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,710
She got an ippon victory in
less than 2 seconds flat!

217
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,650
Coach Yuutenji, what are your comments.. about this genius judo girl?

218
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,820
Genius? That's not enough to describe her!

219
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,820
Her strength is from an accumulation
of effort upon effort!


220
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,210
That razor-sharp execution 
comes from pure devotion!

221
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,370
I'm astonished at the level of jujitsu perfection!

222
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:16,170
I want to applaud not only to Yawara-san, 
but also to her excellent master,
Inokuma Jigoro-sensei!

223
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,380
Main table, I'd like to get a happy comment from that master, Inokuma Jigoro-sensei.

224
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,650
One comment, please.

225
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,840
I told you not to get riled up over just this.

226
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,510
Yawara has the gold medal and the National Achievement Award waiting for...

227
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:34,640
Yawara has the gold medal and the National Achievement Award waiting for...
Tha... that's it for now! Main table, main table!

228
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,520
Tha... that's it for now! Main table, main table!

229
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,370
That was the greatest, Yawara-san! 
Wha.. what can I say.. this feeling..

230
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,510
Move it, move it! I need to make a phone call!

231
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,330
Phone call? Again?

232
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,150
Where have you been calling?

233
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,150
Setagaya's 12th Gym.

234
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,380
Setagaya's 12th?

235
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,590
Isn't that where the High School National Preliminaries are being held?

236
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,180
The Musashiyama Judo team
is in serious trouble.


237
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,920
What? Hanazono-kun is going 
to be in the match?

238
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,230
Y... yes. Hanazono-san is taking off the cast..

239
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,930
Please don't!

240
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,240
W... wait a minute!

241
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,480
Even if the cast is off, he can't 
fight with that leg!

242
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,380
Ah! Hanazono-san!

243
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,870
He's taking the cast off by himself.

244
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,780
Wha.. how reckless!

245
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,840
Inokuma? Hey, Inokuma!

246
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,240
Hanazono-kun? A... are you okay?

247
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,950
No problem! It was getting itchy,
so it was about time.

248
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,710
Listen, Inokuma. You just concentrate 
on becoming Number 1 in Japan!

249
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,610
We will win, too.

250
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,360
We'll win!

251
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,180
Yup!

252
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,990
How about your leg? Doesn't it hurt?

253
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,890
This leg is just fine.

254
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,570
Hanazono-kun? Hanazono-kun?

255
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,580
Wha... wha... wha... what happened?

256
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,160
Yawara-san, it's no good after all.

257
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,200
Wh... what should we do?

258
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,900
NO! It's okay! We're not going to waste Inokuma's efforts of coaching this team!

259
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,950
Ha... Hanazono-kun..

260
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,640
Ippon!

261
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,070
Hon'ami Sayaka has won the 
first 2 rounds with ease.

262
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,300
Sayaka! Sayaka!

263
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,300
A Job well done.

264
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,710
Whoa! She's blowing kisses! 
The fans are going wild!

265
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,960
Hmph! Getting all snotty!


266
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,700
It's just fan service.

267
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,070
Those punks will cry over your 
defeat in the semi-finals.

268
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,770
Nobody will cry over your defeat. 
My, how pitiful!

269
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,450
Okay, next up is a seed player, Tohdoh Yuki.

270
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,030
Uh.. what an intensely frightful look!

271
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,400
Inokuma! We need to go soon. 
You do your best, too.

272
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,040
You can't, Hanazono-kun!


273
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,310
I'll be looking forward to the news
of you becoming Number 1!

274
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,840
Hanazono-kun..

275
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,100
Hello? Hello? Hello... He hung up.

276
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,270
I want to go advise them.. Hanazono-kun 
and everyone else, too.

277
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,290
Don't be stupid!

278
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,030
But, everyone worked so hard every day!

279
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,340
Yet, at this rate, they might lose
in the first round again!

280
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,950
Ippon! 
Ippon -- full 10 points, a win

281
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,760
Don't think about anything right now.
You need to go again soon.

282
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,600
B... but..

283
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,870
All right, say your advice in this!

284
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,900
What?

285
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,660
I'll be your messenger!

286
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,750
Ma... Matsuda-san!

287
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,870
Hanazono-san, let's quit! Come on, let's quit!

288
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,840
I'm okay. You guys straighten up, too.

289
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,250
We need to live up to Inokuma's coaching. Right?

290
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,280
Y... yeah..


291
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,030
Ah, don't get so intimidated over 
Todoroki-dai Kita High!

292
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,360
We'll just flip'em around like pancakes!

293
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,120
Who are you gonna flip around like pancakes?

294
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,970
To... Todoroki-dai Kita High..

295
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,950
It's no good, is it?

296
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,070
Hang on, Musashiyama Judo team!

297
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,080
I'll deliver Yawara-san's voice to you!

298
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,540
Yawara-san.. you better win!

299
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,150
Ippon! 
Ippon -- full 10 points, a win

300
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,000
Th... the invincible Inokuma Yawara!


301
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,370
Both matches were won in a total 
of less than 5 seconds combined...

302
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,110
...with all ippon zeois, 
she's made it to the finals!
ippon zeoi -- one arm shoulder throw

303
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,740
It's almost time for her to fight me!

304
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,540
It's almost the time for her to fight me!

305
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,800
U... umm..

306
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,510
Yawara has the Olympic...

307
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,710
Yawara has the Olympic...
Th... that's all for now! Main table!

308
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,720
