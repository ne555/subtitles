What's that?

20

Five seconds and she's down 
by a yuhkoh already.

a weight difference?

Weight difference is not the problem.

She's just nervous, being in 
her first match and all.

When it's about Yawara Inokuma, 
you seem so excited.

W... well, that's because the more her 
strength is appealed to the world, when you 
do beat her, it'll be more glorious for you!

just happened right now?

No, no, she's only behind by a yuhkoh.

If the match is dragged to the final decision,
it's disadvantageous, but with Yawara-san, 
there won't be any final decisions.

No way! It continues?

33

I feel sorry for her.

34

Just cry, Yawara!

35
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,000
What's with this girl?

36
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,130
I thought she might've been tough, 
but she's unbelievably weak!

37
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,350
Why do I have to go against 
such a neophyte? Geez!

38
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,480
Begin!

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,250
This person... this Yuki Tohdoh is...

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,510
...weak!

41
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,130

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,660
Eii! What's wrong with you, Yawara?

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
I didn't teach you that kind of judo!

44
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,640
What's up? She's being pushed around.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,920
She's not even trying to attack.

46
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,420
Th... this looks bad.

47
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,550
Yawara-san, make a move! 
Just try to attack her!

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,910
That's why you say, but she's really weak!

49
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,340
If I even try to make a move...

50
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,630
Begin!

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,650
Aah, this is irritating!

What's wrong with Inokuma-sempai?

53

That person isn't strong enough for Yawara-san, right, Hanazono-san?

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,060
She's just testing the water.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,830
You're... Ganryuji High's Sasaki!


56
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,690
Her strength isn't what you see there.

57
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,290
Only people who've went against her know that.

58
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,400
In other words, my body
knows her the most.

59
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,880
You! Don't say it so suggestively!

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,200
Well, don't think so suggestively, then!

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,750
What should I do? I can't just
keep running away.

62
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,590
Hey, you! Stop squirming away
and attack me, for once!

63
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,040
Refrain from personal comments. 
Inokuma, be a little more aggressive.

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,210
Y... yes, sir.

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,420
What a tasteless match.

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,160
Is it gonna end like this?

blowing hot air all along.

68

No! It will not end like this!

69
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,710
You're Saikai College's Judo Team Coach, 
Mr. Gohzoh Yuutenji!

70
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,430
That Yawara Inokuma's method of stance...
has no openings whatsoever.

71
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,460
It's not often that you see 
such a controlled stance.

72
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,810
Is that really what it is?

73
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,940
Then, you're saying that she's faking it, 
despite her true strength...

74
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,650
Jigoro Inokuma-sensei is truly amazing. 
Such excellent guidance!

75
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,490
Hey, she's actually strong or something.

76
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,420
Really?

77
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,240
That's what Coach Yuutenji said, so...

78
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,300
Matsuda-san, it's getting worse, isn't it?

79
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,570
If this goes on, they'll know she's faking.

80
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,480
Attack, Yawara-san! Attack her!

81
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,300
But.. but if I try...!


82
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,600
Eii, Yawara! Why are you taking so long?

83
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,440
There! Do a counter attack!

84
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,380
Argh! Cut the crap, Yawara!

85
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,020
Attack, Yawara-san!

86
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,490
I'll win a move from you soon!

87
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,070
There, Yawara!

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,620
Do a move, Yawara-san!

89
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,090
Well, maybe just a bit, then...

90
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,210
She's got her!

91
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,240
No, don't get it!

92

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,660
Why didn't you get it with that?

95
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,920
I thought she got it, but...

96
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,130
...maybe she didn't get it, on purpose?

97
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,230
I can't believe her! Couldn't 
she even dodge that?

98
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,620
I almost scored an ippon just now.
[ippon : full 10 points]

99
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,500
I guess I slacked a bit too much, 
since she's so weak.

100
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,850
I won't make any more mistakes!

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:31,480
Yawara Inokuma. If this is her level, then I
was fired up for nothing, Kazamatsuri-sa..

102
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,680
Yawara threw her, so why didn't she win?

103
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,440
Well that's because...

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,850
Hey, you people, that's enough. 
Stay away from Kazamatsuri-san!

105
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,610
What's with her?

106
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,740
Seems pretty anal.

107
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,780
I told you to stay away!

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,390
Well, she did score a yuhkoh...

109
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,870
It's almost time...

110
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,590
Almost time to lose?

111
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,230
Oh man. I can't bear to watch it!

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,350
Hah! Yawara, you..!

Yawara! You big, fat idiot!

to LOSE, aren't you?

Oh no. Grandpa found out!

Please calm down!

122
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,240
Eii! Let go of me!

123
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,690
Don't pull any stupid tricks, Yawara!

124
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,780
I'd better hurry up and lose!

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,490
Inokuma-sensei, why is 
Yawara-san trying to lose?

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,050
Oh, Hanazono-kun!

127
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,330
Listen carefully, you too, reporters.
This isn't a match!

128
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,200
Not a match? What's tha...

129
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,370
Eii, shut your trap and just listen!

130
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,960
Yawara has attained terrifying strength
from my superb teachings.

131
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,540
But that child, for some ridiculous reason, doesn't want to do judo! Weird child, she is!

132
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,460
But, out of the blue, Yawara said 
that she's going to do a match.

133
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,230
I thought something smelled, and I was right!

134
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,840
She'll lose on purpose to show that she's weak, and disprove all the media hype. 
That's what she's trying to do!

135
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,010
What?


136
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,230
What the heck is this 
gramps babbling about?

137
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,160
You're saying that just to 
cover up her weakness.

138
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,120
That's not it, you retards!

139
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,900
She's trying to be a normal girl!

140
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,130
Nonetheless, this kind of 
match isn't newsworthy.

141
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,500
What a load of crap!

142
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,120
How dare you be so rude and 
call her a load of crap!

143
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,430
That's right! Inokuma-sempai
is really strong!

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,410
It was close, but everyone is starting 
to think that Yawara-san is weak.

145

153
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,110
Geez! Why can't you get 
an ippon with that?
[ippon: full 10 points]

154
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,620
Yawara Inokuma! I'm ashamed to 
have regarded you as a rival!

155
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,480
Is it still going?

156
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,860
Just cry, Yawara!

157
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,530
Butt out! Go home!

158
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,700
I can't watch this anymore.

159
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,190
Matsuda-san...

160
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,980
All right, then! I'll just have 
to end this match by force!

161
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,600
What are you thinking?

162
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,500
Stop this old man!

163
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,200
Eii, let go! You want me to place painful 
moves on you? Let go! Just let go!

164
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,140
Hey, what are you trying 
to do to Inokuma-sensei!

165
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,730
Hold them back!

166
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,420
These guys are trying to ruin the match to cover the fact that Yawara Inokuma is weak!

167
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,930
Th... that's not it!

168
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,750
Inokuma! Show us your... 
Show us your true strength!

169
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,760
Yawara! Yawara-san! Yawara-sempai!

170
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,740
Everyone... I'm sorry.

171
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,710
Begin!

172
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,540
Dosu-koi!
[Dosu-koi: sumo grunt]


173
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm... going to lose now!

174
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,040
And now, everything will end.

175
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,880
The star that was supposed to 
shine for Japan's Judo World and
Japan's Sports World will now...

176
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,570
..fall from the sky.

177
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,000
Yawara-san, please obtain 
your normal happiness!

178
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,820
Uhm..

179
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,110
Is this the way to the judo hall?

180
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,160
Y... yes! Th... there was dust in my eyes!

181
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,890
Thank you very much.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,420
Uhm..

183
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,760
Let me say this...

184
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,760
This match isn't too fun to watch.

185
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,080
Even that housewife is Yawara-san's fan.


186
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,900
She was really supposed to 
become every citizen's idol.

187
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,470
It's almost over! Please score 
a clean ippon from me, okay?

188
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,110
Yawara!

189
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,980
Goodbye to early morning 
and night practices!

190
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,440
I won't ever have to throw anybody 
with an ippon zeoi anymore!

191
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,820
Inokuma!

192
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,420
I'll become a normal girl so I can... I can...

193
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,030
Eii, how persistent!

194
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,140
M... mom?

195
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,580
Mom!

196
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,910
No! No, no, no!

197
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,150
That didn't happen! Referee, 
let's just forget this!

198
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,810
I'm sorry! I didn't do anything!

199
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,030
I...

200
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,760
No, don't!

201
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,730
I... IPPON!
[ippon: full 10 points]

202
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
The star... has fallen.

203
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,560
Everything is over.

204
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,850
Yawara-san, it was brief, but thanks 
for letting me see a good dream.

205
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,300
Resignation

206
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,200
I guess I'll go back to Yamagata and 
take over the family hostel.

207
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,750
Chopping firewood and fishing
can't be all that bad.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,690
Cheer up, Kosaku Matsuda!

209
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,850
Crying's no fun, let's just laugh!

210
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,950
Y... Yawara-san?

211
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,460
Matsuda-san!

212
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,480
W... what's happening, Yawara-san?

213
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,410
What's going on? What just
happened, Yawara-san?

214
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,170
I...

215
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,260
I...

216
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,840
... WON!

217
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,050
What?

218
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,530
I... I got it!

219
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,100
I got it perfectly, Matsuda-san!

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,070
But, why... why did she win?

221
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,290
Taxi!

222
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,660
Hurry! Hurry in!

223
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,550
Matsuda-san!

224
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,080
Don't worry. Just leave the rest to me!

225
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,470
But what did she mean that she won?

226
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,250
Hey, Daily Every! Why'd you let her get away?

227
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,480
U... uhh, wait. I don't know what's 
going on here. What happened?


228
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,220
Yeah right, quit fooling!

229
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,850
Didn't you see that 70kg-plus heavyweight,
Yuki Tohdoh, flown in an instant?

230
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,740
Oh man!

231
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,670
Terrifying!

232
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,090
It's unfortunate for Yuki Tohdoh not to
have taken her seriously, but to have
been thrown with such sharpness...

233
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,800
...you'd forget to do ukemi and pass out.
[ukemi: falling technique]

234
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,520
Coach Yuutenji, so the winning move was Yawara Inokuma's ippon zeoi?
[ippon zeoi : one arm shoulder throw]

235
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,830
It all happened so fast that it was 
hard to figure anything out.

236
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah, as soon as we saw Inokuma
move into the opponent's space...

237
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,280
..the next moment, Tohdoh's
massive body was in mid-air.

238
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,660
Just thinking of it makes me have goosebumps. Just like this, see?

239
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,350
What speed!

240
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,710
Truly the epitome of 
"Softness yields even strength!"

241
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,610
That's only the tip of the iceberg.

242
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,800
If you're blown away with just that, then your heart won't be able to handle what's to come.

243
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,220
Inokuma-sensei!

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,950
I am very deeply moved right now!


245
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,780
You have developed your 
granddaughter so... so well!

246
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,850
Then stop having such a large face and 
go develop an athlete to rival Yawara.

247
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,580
I shall!

248
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,640
Sensei!

249
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:57,700
Sensei!

250
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,360
Inokuma-sensei!

251
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,800
Please let us be your students!

252
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,020
Just as much as Yawara-san's 
fingernail crumbs' worth of training 
will do! Please instruct us!

253
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,890
That's rude! Yawara-san does NOT
have any fingernail crumbs!

254
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,840
Kids, become stronger then. 
Because, I don't teach wimps!

255
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,360
That was an excellent debut.

256
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,670
This is why I abandoned everything
to devote myself to judo.

257
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,020
Right, Kazamatsuri-sa...

258
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,660
Kazamatsuri-san, does that mean 
Yawara won that match?

259
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,700
What just happened in there?

260
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,140
Okay then! Let me explain the 
judo rules over some tea!

261
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,530
Th... this is preposterous!

262
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,810
Matsuda-kun! Our company's star!

263
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,400
You did it! That was great!

264
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,390
Kamoda! Is it developed?

265
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,130
Matsuda-san! Where'd you go? I got it!

266
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,230
If you tell me you missed it, I'll slice 
up that pineapple head of yours!

267
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,390
Y... you...!

268
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,000
I... is there a problem?

269
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,040
You're Japan's Number 1!

270
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,920
This is awesome!

271
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:38,410
The cheering's back. The cheering 
of the large crowds again!

272
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,610
Yawara Inokuma, you're one of 
those athletes that either appear 
or not in decades... a superstar!

273
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,570
But, why did Yawara-san win a match 
she was supposed to lose?

274
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,440
Yeah! Why? Huh? Why?

275
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,430
U...uhm...

276
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,350
Well.. she yelled this right before she 
threw the ippon zeoi.. "Mom!"

277
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,420
"Mom"?

278
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,690
Geez, Mom, you appeared out of nowhere.

279
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,450
I was so surprised that I threw 
her with an ippon zeoi!
[ippon zeoi : one arm shoulder throw]

280
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,130
So, you were trying to lose that match?

281
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm so sorry.

282
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,560
Well, it's not your fault, really.

283
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,180
But, why did you want to lose?

284
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,800
I wanted to quit judo.

285
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,120
It'll take forever for a strong girl 
like me to find a boyfriend.

286
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,670
Boyfriend?

287
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,700
You are of that age already, aren't you?

288
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,850
I am a high school senior, you know.

289
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,460
But, Yawara...

290
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,350
You may be strong in judo, but 
that's nothing compared to me.

291
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,140
Mom... strong?

292
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Uh-huh. I had you and raised 
you up to this day.

293
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,290
That's true, since you did it 
all alone without dad.

294
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,080
Women get stronger and stronger,
regardless of any help!

295
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,700
You'll understand this someday...

296
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,310
...of what it means to be truly strong.

297
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,380
Whether you quit or go on 
with judo is up to you.

298
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:25,380
But, if a boy looks at you strangely just 
because you do judo, then that's when 
you SHOULD do an ippon zeoi on them!

299
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,340
Mom!

300
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,220
The key is to not lose 
your femininity, Yawara!

301
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,530
Am I feminine now?

302
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,110
You're a very attractive girl!

303
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,230
Just like me when I was young!

304
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,370
Really? Am I really feminine?

305
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,010
Yawara! What the heck was today's match!!

306
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,340
Grandpa!

307
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,500
I never taught you that kind of judo!

308
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,020
How dare you scheme of losing on purpose!

309
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,110
Welcome home, Father.

310
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,890
T... Tamao-san, you're back?

311
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,790
I apologize for leaving the 
house for such a long time.

312
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,240
Dinner's ready, but would you 
like to take a bath first?

313
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,970
It's not your fault, Tamao-san, 
but I don't need dinner.

314
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,770
I'm so upset that I can't eat, all 
because of a stupid girl!

315
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,300
Who are you calling a stupid girl!?

316
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,060
I made your favorite, hijiki no gomokuni.

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,850
Stop it!

318
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,080
I don't need dinner.. dinner.. dinner...

319
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,240
Seconds, please.

320
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,440
Tamao-san's cooking is always the best.

321
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,500
Yawara's cooking is too foreign! Judo athlete's food should be native dishes!

322
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,420
Whatever! I'll never cook for you again!

323
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,010
All you make is that "strong combo"
beef bowl anyway!

324
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,510
Beef stroganoff!


325
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,600
Oh yes. The reason I went to Hida 
Takayama is because of a rumor...

326
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,380
...that somebody took a picture 
of a Kojiro-san like person.

327
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,100
Dad?

328
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,470
Isn't this an abominable snowman?

329
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,860
Is this really Dad?

330
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,400
As soon as he sensed people, he ran away. This is a picture of the footprints.

331
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,170
These are wood slippers. I see, 
it's very Kojiro-like to wear those.

332
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,840
Wearing wood slippers
in snow... seems cold!

333
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,980
Dad should end his training and 
just come back already!

334
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,140
You don't need to worry about that.

335
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,690
You made your debut today.


336
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,790
You need to start practicing more 
to get the gold medal and the 
National Achievement Award.

337
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,380
Grandpa, I...

338
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,310
If you ever pull a stunt like that again, 
you'll be banished from this family!

339
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,000
I will not be manipulated by you, Grandpa!

340
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,830
You're ippon zeoi is nothing yet!
I'm going to make you stronger 
with more and more discipline!

341
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,090
Grandpa!

342
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,230
Oh my!

343
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,990
A cha-bashira, look!
[cha-bashira : vertical tea stem]

344
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,920
That's a wonderfully good omen! Gold medal and the National Achievement Award is 
going to become a reality, then! Right?

345
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,440
Grandpa...

346
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,160
950 Days to Barcelona Olympics

347
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,210
Debut match and first victory! 
The first step to the gold medal and 
the National Achievement Award.

348
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,210
Grandpa! I had no intention
of making a debut.

349
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,320
Even if you didn't, the rest of 
the world think otherwise.

350
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,710
Just look at your school.

351
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,180
What? No way! The whole 
school's riled up!

352
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,510
Causing a ruckus is an idol's destiny.

353
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,830
Next time, on "Yawara" ...

354
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,370
"Big Panic at High School 
With The Yawara Fame!"

355
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,720
I'll do a kesa-gatame on 
those who don't watch!
