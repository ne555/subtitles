I am not being violent!

Hurry up and change into your dogis!
[dogis :judo uniforms]

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,570
B... but, we don't have practice today...

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,040
Geez! Stop complaining and
get into your dogis, pronto!

14
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,150

Episode 12
Coach Yawara's Extracurricular Lesson!

16
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,230
T... training?

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,390
Yup. All of you want to be stronger, right?

18
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,900
W... well, yeah, but...

19
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,000
Can we?


20
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,560
We have no potential, though.

21
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,380
We're so pathetically weak.

22
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,800
Aren't you the least bit angry?

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,610
That freshmen raided your judo club and
even sent Hanazono-kun to the hospital.

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,630
Well yeah, that Sudoh creep...

25
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,070
...makes us angry but...

26
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,330
...we can't do anything about it.

27
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,750
Oh, yes you can!

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,030
Let's punish that bad boy.

29
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,440
Let's show him that you upperclassmen
are stronger and pound him into pulp!

30
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,000
But we're not that strong... REALLY.

31
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,170
We are REALLY weak, though.

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,980
But, Yawara-san, you've been reluctant
to be involved with this judo club...

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,900
...why the sudden change of heart?

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,770
Don't tell me Sudoh did something to you!

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,190
What? No!

36
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,140
Oh yes... just thinking about
it gives me the chills!

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,770
What a jerk!

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,120
Even you were tainted by his evilness!

39
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,060
There! Those eyes! You guys are
finally willing to fight him!

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,760
N... no, no, not us. You fight him, Yawara-san!

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,120
Not on your life!

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
I absolutely refuse to grapple with him!

43
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,600
So, shall we begin the training then?

44
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,710
Come on, I'll go easy on you, okay?

45
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay then, to start off, let's just
do 100 laps of harabai...
[harabai : stomach crawl]

46
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,700
100 laps of ahiru aruki, and 100 V-ji fukki.
[ahiru aruki : duck walk]
[V-ji fukkin : v-shaped crunches]

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,640
Huh? I do this routine every day.

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,040
Jigoro-sensei, what do you think of it?

49
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,600
The Saikai College Judo Club would love
to add Yawara-san to the team. Oh yes!

50
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,500
If it's your team, then it should be sufficient.

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,010
I'm sure Yawara would love to join.

52
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,460
Oh really! I've been waiting for that...

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,830
Have some more ichigo daifuku.
[ichigo daifuku : strawberry rice cakes].

54
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,470
Oh no, no, no. I've already
had seven of them so...

55
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,340
Don't hold yourself back. Here,
there's even banana rice cake too.

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,190
Well, I guess I'll have another.

57
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,310
But, there is one problem regarding
her official admission.

58
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,790
That is, Yawara-san does not have an
official track record of performances.

59
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,210
I see. Even yesterday's match
was only a practice match.

60
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,060
Yes. I fully understood her true
strength from that match...

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,040
... but in order for her to be
recommended for a scholarship,
she needs to have an official record.

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,860
An official record... meaning to be in
an official tournament and win, right?

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Yes. I'd like Yawara-san to be in one.

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,160
The larger, the better.

65
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,000
Huh?

66
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,960
I am not letting Yawara be
in a small tournament.

67
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,120
It has to be at least a national
martial arts hall-sized arena, and
must have national TV coverage.

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,850
That would be no problem at all!

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,160
Excellent! Then it's all set.

70
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,650
So, to celebrate, how about another one?

71
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,340
Great job, great job! Way to go, everyone!

72
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,270
Y... Yawara-san! Do you always do this?

73
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,290
Well, yes, ever since I was little.

74
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,810
If you keep it up, you can
easily beat Sudoh.

75
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,270
B... before that happens, we'll
probably die of exhaustion!

76
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,120
Oh yeah! We should do early
morning practices, too.

77
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,170
Let's meet at 6am, okay?

78
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,500
What?

79
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
Everyone, fight!

80
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,320
Yawara Inokuma...

81
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,040
While you're playing around in Japan, I've become stronger two- and three- fold.

82
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,020
Don't be too surprised when you see me next.

83
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,820
Right, Kazama...

84
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,490
Kazamatsuri Coach!

85
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,120
W... well, judo is popular
in France, too, I guess.

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,820
As a judo athlete, I felt I could help
improve international relations...

87
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,460
Wow, Parisans are so forward!

88
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,640
Miss! Miss Sayaka!

89
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,240
I found one!

90
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,960
There's going to be a women's judo tournament in a few days, right here in Paris.

91
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,390
I see. Good job, Tokunaga.

92
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,200
Yes.


93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,360
It'll be a great way to finish
off my training tour.

94
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,490
I'm leaving.

95
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,810
Wait a minute, Yawara.

96
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,080
Your boxed lunch.

97
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,410
Oh gosh, I forgot!

98
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,790
You've been leaving for school
really early these past few days.

99
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,350
Is there a reason why?

100
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,470
Sort of.

101
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Yawara!

102
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,970
Where are you going, instead of
doing early morning practices?

103
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,380
Well, actually, to morning
practices... at school.

104
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,250
Umm, I'm leaving!

105
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,950
Be careful, Yawara.

106
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,620
Okay.

107
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,060
Is that so?

108
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,780
She finally... finally practices willfully.

109
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,090
She probably wanted to train in secrecy
to surprise me with her improvements.

110
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:42,260
How cute! Then, I'll keep the
tournament situation a secret.

111
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,370
Yawara, I can't wait to break
the happy news to you!

112
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,890
That was close.

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,720
Early morning practices... at school?

114
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,630
Yawara-san, don't tell me...

115
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,270
Don't tell me that you're
finally serious about judo?

116
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,550
Kohno-kun.

117
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,540
With a small frame like yours, don't try
to force moves on people.

118
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,770
And because the opponent is larger, you need to use their strength in your favor.

119
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,640
O... okay, Yawara-san.

120
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,210
There, do a de-ashi barai now!
[de-ashi barai : forward foot sweep]

121
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,130
O... okay!

122
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,210
Kohno-kun, nice!

123
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,070
Great!

124
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,330
You did it, Kohno!

125
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,420
It was luck, just luck.

126
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,470
D... darnit! One more time!

127
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,360
That's the spirit, everyone! Fight!

128
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,770
Bummer.. Yawara-san is
just training them.

129
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,490
But, was Musashiyama High's
judo club this decent?

130
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,860
What have you been writing?

131
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,340
A challenge to a duel.

132
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,270
A challenge to a duel? What for?

133
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,160
But... I don't know how to write one!

134
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,220
But... I don't know how to write one!
Let me see it.

135
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,970
Let me see it.

136
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,890
No, don't!

137
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,540
Well, what's it say?

138
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,930
"Dear Sudoh-sama, you're probably surprised by this sudden letter, right?

139
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,920
I would like for you to come to
the judo club dojo after school.

140
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,450
Please come, okay? -- Yawara"

141
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
Aren't challenges to a duel supposed
to be a little more intimidating?

142
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,720
That's what I have trouble with.

143
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,510
I think it's fine.

144
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,790
Yeah, as long as the message gets through.

145
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,520
You sure?

146
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,600
Yeah, yeah. The writing's cute, too.

147
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,400
Oh well, this should do.

148
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,440
So...

149
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,400
What are you gonna do with that, Yawara?

150
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,710
Darnit, what a nagging teacher!
Lecturing me forever...

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,250
Oh, hey! Yawara-chan gave
me a love letter!

152
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,350
I'm so lucky!

153
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,570
This is my first time...

154
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,250
...to have these feelings.

155
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,420
Please be gentle...

156
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,680
...when you do a vertical four-direction
hold, okay... Sudoh-kun.

157
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,770
I hope so!

158
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:18,730
I thought Yawara-chan would be an untouchable person, like a TV idol,
but she's so reachable now!

159
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,520
But, why a date at the dojo? Oh well,
it's so like Yawara-chan!

160
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,020
Inside, Yawara-chan's heart must be
fluttering with anticipation.

161
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:35,210
Well, as you wished, we'll entangle
with a tate shihoh gatame of my love.
[tate shihoh gatame : vertical four-direction hold]

162
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,250
Yawara-chan!

163
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,180
Wha...?

164
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,620
Wha... what the hell is this?

165
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,930
Please hurry and change into a dogi.
[dogi : judo uniform]

166
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,520
You gave me a love letter, and
now you want me in a dogi?

167
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,830
Lo... love letter?

168
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,590
What are you talking about?
You're doing a match!

169
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,090
These upperclassmen will teach
you the horror of real judo.

170
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,320
Please.

171
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,510
Dork, don't ask or greet the guy
that you're gonna fight against!

172
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,220
Was this supposed to be
a challenge to a duel?

173
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,610
Even your challenges are so cute, Yawara-chan!

174
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,450
The anguish you've caused Hanazono-kun..

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,400
The disrespectful attitude you've
had with these upperclassmen..

176
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,460
And, for touching my butt...

177
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,620
For everything, I mean everything --
you will apologize for them!

178
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,490
S... Sudoh, we won't let you
get near Yawara-san!

179
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,540
That's right!

180
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,200
Whoa.. am I the bad guy now?

181
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,600
Oh well, if you country boys win,
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

182
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,680
I can run around the school 10 times, naked.

183
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,040
G... go change in the locker room!

184
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,600
You wanted to watch, didn't you?

185
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,340
Yeah right!

186
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,040
What?

187
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,830
Inokuma gave Sudoh a challenge to a duel?

188
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,450
Just for me... Inokuma!

189
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,670
Oh, so that's what it's about. That's
why Yawara-san trained them.

190
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,090
I guess. She wouldn't ever
be so self-motivated.

191
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,730
Hiya, Daily Every.

192
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,290
Inokuma-san.

193
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,860
Are you guys still sniffing
around like a hyena, eh?

194
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,530
Hey, don't talk about us like that.

195
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,970
But what about you today, Inokuma-san?

196
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
I came to see the self-motivated
Yawara in her training.

197
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,530
You're sniffing around just like us, too!

198
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
I am NOT a hyena!

199
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,510
But, regardless, you're not right, Inokuma-san.

200
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,430
Are you ready? We'll begin.

201
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,670
Sure, but if I defeat these country boys, Yawara-chan.. date me.

202
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,980
D... date?

203
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,450
S... sure, but I doubt that
will happen. Right?

204
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,590
What? That's too much
at stake! I can't do that...

205
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,430
It's okay. You became stronger.

206
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,750
Just remember what you
did during practice.

207
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,120
B... but, I've never won...

208
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,660
That child! She was just training others?

209
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,930
Seems like it.

210
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,970
She needs another 30 years before
she could teach! Yawara!

211
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,170
Start!

212
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,810
Hey you! Don't run away!

213
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,190
Wha... what should I do?

214
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
A date with Yawara-chan!

215
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,410
What should I do? If I lose, Yawara-san
has to date this jerk!

216
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,510
What should I do?

217
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,670
Inokuma.

218
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,870
When the opponent's right foot touches
the mat, push off with the right hand...

219
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,570
..and pull in with the left hand.
You practiced this many times.

220
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,320
You can do it!

221
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,100
W... what?

222
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,940
De ashi barai! Ippon!
[De ashi barai : forward foot sweep]
[Ippon : full 10 points, a win]

223
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,390
All right!

224
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,620
I won... this is the first time I won!

225
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,510
Kohno-kun!

226
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,220
Yawara-san, did you see me? I... I...

227
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,050
That was great, Kohno-kun!

228
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,320
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

229
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,030
Hmph, I just happened to
slack off, that's all!

230
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,300
I'll win this time. Who's next?

231
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,230
Umm, when the opponent moves to
the left side, with my left foot...

232
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,380
...sweep the right foot so both of
his feet come together...

233
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,440
Quit mumbling!

234
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,580
When the opponent moves to the left side...

235
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:06,890
When the opponent moves to the left side...
...sweep so that both of his feet come together!

236
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,030
...sweep so that both of his feet come together!

237
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,850
Ippon!
[Ippon : full 10 points, a win]

238
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,000
I did it!

239
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,330
Why?

240
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,740
She doesn't have time to
meddle in these things.

241
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,360
I need to take Yawara home, pronto.

242
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,600
Wait up!

243
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,510
Hey, let go! Let me go!

244
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,910
Hatakeyama-kun, you were great!

245
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,100
Her expression.. Yawara-san's such
lively expression.. this is a first!

246
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,770
What about it?

247
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,820
Regardless of the circumstances, she is.. getting excited about judo for the first time!

248
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,230
Do your best!

249
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,150
Get the opponent's right foot
so that your left heel...

250
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,550
Get the opponent's right foot
so that your left heel...
... is perpendicular to it and
tap it like a hammer!

251
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,400
... is perpendicular to it and
tap it like a hammer!

252
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,680
This is... not happening!

253
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,940
You're the last one!

254
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,640
Go for it, Yasui!

255
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,580
Your left elbow is lowered and pulling in...

256
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:09,810
Your left elbow is lowered and pulling in...
... while your right hand is pushing
his collar to the lower left.

257
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,280
... while your right hand is pushing
his collar to the lower left.

258
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,360
And, when the body weight
is on his left foot...

259
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,500
... wrap you leg so that the backs
of your knee and his meet.

260
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,180
Oo-uchi gari ippon!
[Oo-uchi gari : major inner reaping throw]
[ippon : a full 10 points, a win]

261
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,710
We won!

262
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,590
They did it! They did it!

263
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,840
All of you were great! Really great!

264
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,460
We finally won, for the first time!

265
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,510
It's all because of you, Yawara-san!

266
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
Yeah, Yawara-san!

267
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,980
No. It was because all of you
worked so hard the past week.

268
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,400
You really worked hard!

269
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,320
Yawara-san!

270
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,380
What's up with this!

271
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,030
How dare you... do some soap opera...
in front of me!

272
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,370
To heck with "Yawara"! You're just a girl!

273
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,530
When a man gets serious,
a girl is just.. a girl is just..

274
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,500
She's... STRONG!

275
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,930
Yawara!

276
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,250
How long are you going to meddle
with them, you big fool!

277
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,270
You have a big tournament awaiting you!

278
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,510
Grandpa!

279
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,630
Inokuma-san, what did you just say?

280
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,090
Yawara will be in a big tournament soon.

281
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,290
And there, she will prove that
she's number one in Japan!

282
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,190
Wh... what did you say?

283
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,970
Who decided this and when?

284
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,220
I decided yesterday.

285
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,270
Don't make decisions for me!

286
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,800
Your future is riding on this.

287
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,710
In other words, you'll win this tournament,
get on the Saikai College judo team...

288
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,510
... win the gold medal at the Olympics, and then receive the National Achievement Award.

289
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
Isn't that an excellent life plan?

290
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,690
No.


291
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:58,940
No.
M... Matsuda-san.

292
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,540
M... Matsuda-san.

293
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,740
This is big! This is tomorrow's front page!

294
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,640
This time... this time, let's get serious, Yawara-san!

295
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,270
Got it, Yawara? You will not stray
from this path to glory.


296
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,480
If you keep meddling with these worthless people, your skills will only get worse.

297
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,290
Worthless...

298
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,640
... people?

299
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,930
Grandpa! That's pretty rude. Everyone
is trying so hard to do judo!

300
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,520
Right, everyone?

301
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,350
Come.

302
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,240
Geez... no!


303
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,450
Well then, excuse us.

304
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,560
Gosh, Grandpa!

305
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,000
We're the "worthless people" ?

306
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,560
That wasn't too nice, huh?

307
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,330
We worked so hard for a week, too.

308
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,140
But...

309
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,310
For a really strong person like her, it's no wonder we're treated like worthless people.

310
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,670
I.. had some confidence
in doing judo, but..

311
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,600
...but she threw me so easily.

312
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,270
Why is she so strong, dammit?!

313
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,420
Wait up, Grandpa! I said wait up!

314
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,840
Wait up, Grandpa! I said wait up!
Shut your trap!

315
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,710
Shut your trap!

316
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,240
Hey!

317
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,850
What, all of a sudden?

318
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,280
Let's get Yawara-chan to be our coach.

319
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,710
B... but...

320
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,780
As bad as you wimpy dudes were, she improved you guys in just one week!

321
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,210
Wimpy dudes?


322
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,930
But, he is right. If we're trained some more,
we might become even stronger!

323
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Well, we never knew that winning
could feel so good.

324
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,140
Yeah! If Yawara-san trained us, we might be able to win the first round of preliminaries.

325
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,370
Winning the first round of prelims
sounds like such a dream!

326
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,220
Why are you guys so small-hearted?

327
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,240
The tournament! Aim to win
the tournament, man!

328
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,090
T... tournament?

329
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,230
All right, it's set. Yawara-chan
is the judo club's coach!

330
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,730
Wow!

331
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,880
B... but, Sudoh-kun...

332
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,800
Yawara-san has a big tournament coming up, so she doesn't have time to...

333
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,570
This is exactly why we're treated
like worthless people!

334
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,950
If I ask her, she'll be our coach for sure.

335
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,170
What the heck are you talking about?

336
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,510
What an arrogant guy...

337
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,310
Don't you wanna be strong?

338
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,480
W... well, yeah, but...


339
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,820
Umm, I apologize for what
Grandpa said earlier.

340
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,110
He has a bad mouth, but inside... well,
he's not that good inside, either...

341
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,630
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Yawara-chan!

343
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,070
You still want to fight?

344
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,710
Got it, Yawara?

345
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,560
You're going to run straight to the
National Achievement Award!

346
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,130
If you follow me, you'll be Japan's number one, no the world's number one...

347
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,040
Oh yes, the world's number
one happy person!

348
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:04,450
To be approached so aggressively by a gentleman at my age is so exciting!

349
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,980
You tricked me, Yawara!

350
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,470
Yawara! Yawara!

351
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,870
What? You want me to be
this judo club's coach?

352
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:19,950
Yup!

353
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,610
See! It's not possible.

354
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,520
Yawara-san has a big
tournament coming up.

355
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,290
I'm not going to be in that tournament.

356
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,170
See? Now there's no problems!

357
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,700
Yawara-san, will you really do it?

358
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,660
Be our coach?

359
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,480
This match can't even be called judo.

360
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,180
I'll teach you what REAL judo is all about,
Ms. Rag Dance Champion!

361
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,670
Umm, well...

362
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,700
Miss Sayaka is... Mademoiselle...
trying to... well, umm...

363
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,320
Tokunaga, hurry up and translate it!

364
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,540
W... well, to make a long story
short... umm, umm...

365
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,160
Tokunaga!

366
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,540
Yes... Anyway, she umm...

367
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,350
That was excellent, Sayaka-san.

368
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,460
Everyone in France, this is the real
strength of Japanese women's judo.

369
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,010
That's right, listen up, Yawara Inokuma!

370
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,200
The Number 1 of Japan is me, Sayaka Hon'ami!

371
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,790
Ya-wa-ra! Ya-wa-ra!

372
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,310
Ya-wa-ra! Ya-wa-ra!
I... I... I...

373
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,670
Ya-wa-ra! Ya-wa-ra!

374
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,700
Ya-wa-ra! Ya-wa-ra!
Inokuma!

375
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:07,740
Ya-wa-ra! Ya-wa-ra!

376
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,630
Ya-wa-ra! Ya-wa-ra!
W... wait a minute! Umm... I...

377
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,060
Ya-wa-ra! Ya-wa-ra!

378
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,010
Yawara! The big tournament is coming up!

379
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:21,900
922 days until the Barcelona Olympics

380
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,410
Yawara! The tournament!

381
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,570
A big tournament is waiting for you!

382
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,010
It's finally time for you to
fight Miss Sayaka!

383
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,300
Huh? Sayaka-san is?

384
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,130
Sayaka-san is alone with
Kazamatsuri-san for training?

385
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,670
Now that it's settled, it's time to eat!

386
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,610
Add more stamina to win the tournament
with all ippon victories!

387
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,960
Kazamatsuri-san is.. Kazamatsuri-san
is with Sayaka-san?

388
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,610
Next time, on "Yawara!" ...

389
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,530
"Yawara's Heart Shook in Hayama!"

390
