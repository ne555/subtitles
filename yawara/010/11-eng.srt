1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,600
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,500
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,900
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,400
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,140
Mom!

10
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,820
Episode 11
Big Panic at High School 
With the Yawara Fame!

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,440
Congratulations, Yawara Inokuma!

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,960
Congratulations, Yawara Inokuma!
Nippon, cha-cha-cha!

13
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,190
Congratulations, Yawara Inokuma!

14
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,660
Congratulations, Yawara Inokuma!
Nippon, cha-cha-cha!

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:56,810
Congratulations, Yawara Inokuma!

16
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,210
Congratulations, Yawara Inokuma!
Fure, fure, Ya-wa-ra! Sore!
[typical Japanese cheer]

17
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:01,360
Congratulations, Yawara Inokuma!

18
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,220
I saw it on the sports news!

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,810
I was delighted. Your ippon zeoi 
is Musashiyama High's pride, 
hope, and shining star!

20
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,810
And so! How about making 
a female judo club?

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
Female judo club?

22
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,420
If you perform well, our school's name will reach every household nationwide.

23
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,830
Right, Kaizuka-sensei?

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,820
W... well, that's true.

25
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,320
That's too much for me! 
I want to go to college!

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,540
No problem!

27
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,700
I'm sure athletic colleges will come to 
recruit you, so you don't need to worry.

28
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,440
I want to go to an all-female 2-year 
college as a housekeeping major!

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,000
If it's housekeeping, then
the athletic colleges...

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,780
Wha... what did you just say?

31
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,690
I want to go to an all-female 2-year
college as a housekeeping major!

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,000
What? H... ho... housekeeping?

33
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,940
A... are you sure about this? Even if you're strong in judo, you can't just get in so easily.

34
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,800
You need to study for the entrance exam, 
and what'll happen if you fail?

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,150
That's why I don't have 
time to do any clubs.

36
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,220
Excuse me.

37
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,000
Yawara-kun.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,010
Inokuma.

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,760
Kaizuka-kun!

40
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,670
Yes?


41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,120
Why'd she choose housekeeping?

42
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,340
Don't "heh?" me! You don't get 
a chance like this that often!

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,420
Is there any way you could convince
her to change her mind?

44
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,360
Kaizuka-sensei!

45
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,840
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,820
There! Keep Going!

47
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,470
Go, go! Almost!

48
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,430
Wimp.

49
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,250
That's 10 losses in a row!

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,000
Shut up.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,410
But, if Hanazono-san saw us 
like this, he'll cry again.

52
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,670
That's okay. Hanazono-san said he's 
not coming. He's out college-hunting.

53
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,960
I see. Once Hanazono-san graduates though, it'll be the end for this judo club.


54
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,720
We're just too weak to train 
any new members.

55
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,260
We're so pathetically weak.

56
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,750
Loser judo club.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,400
The disgrace of high school judo.

58
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,770
Clumsy, let me try.

59
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,320
Hold on, just one more time.

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,080
You'll lose again anyway. Let me try.

61
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
No! This time I'll win.

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,160
Yeah right.

63
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,960
Ah!

64
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,910
Quit faking me out again.

65
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,160
N... no. Look!

66
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,700
Wha... what's up?

67
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,430
They're laughing!

68
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,220
They probably came to mock us,
the loser judo club!

69
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,210
Is Inokuma-sempai here?

70
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,840
What?

71
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,140
Yawara-san is in this judo club, right?

72
00:04:59,410 --> 00:04:59,970
Huh?

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,840
We're interested in joining
Yawara-san's judo club!

74
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,010
Doom.

75
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,370
What's wrong?

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,310
Just thinking about studying for the college entrance exam is making me depressed.

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,510
That's true.

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,570
Talk about a small-scale study war!

79
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,650
But you're lucky, Yawara.

80
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,210
Huh? Why?

81
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,250
Aren't you going to continue on with judo?

82
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,250
What? Of course not!

83
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,960
I want to be a normal 
female college student!

84
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,390
Oh really.

85
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,750
Come on, let's go eat 
something to feel better!

86
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,130
Right on! Let's go!

87
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,390
Right on! Let's go!
Yawara-san!

88
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,100
Yawara-san!

89
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,360
What? You didn't intend to win?

90
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,900
Yeah.. I just kind of threw her.

91
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,770
Just kind of threw her..?

92
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,470
You weren't finally serious 
about doing judo?

93
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,160
You didn't decide to continue doing judo?

94
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,630
Th... the cheering of the large crowds
has once again faded away.

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,270
M... Matsuda-san, get a hold of yourself!

96
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,020
Hey, what are you going to do now? 
You won, you know!

97
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,280
You can't run away anymore.

98
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,300
It's all because my mom came
back from nowhere.

99
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,030
Mom?

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,500
So, your mother came back home?!

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,630
She found your estranged father,
Kojiro Inokuma, didn't she?

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,620
That's a scoop!

103
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,390
And so, what was he doing all this time?

104
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,310
Does he have any intentions of 
returning to the judo world?

105
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,900
Come on, tell me! Why was
he away for so long?

106
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,910
That has nothing to do with you!

107
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,430
No, it does! I need to know
everything about you!

108
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,640
Leave me alone!

109
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,240
Hey, wait! Yawara-san!

110
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,340
Geez!

111
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,420
Oh my...

112
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
E... excuse me!

113
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,280
What's up?

114
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,930
Hanazono-san is still out, 
visiting some athletic college.

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,050
What about Yawara-san?

116
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
She's already gone home.
What should we do?

117
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,870
Yawara-san has nothing to 
do with this anyway.

118
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,890
Should we tell them?

119
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,970
We have no choice.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,030
But if we do that, everyone will leave!

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,870
What else can we do, then?

122
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,020
Wha... what the hell?

123
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,030
Hey, sempai dudes, is Yawara-chan here?

124
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,940
I came here to join the club 
to see Yawara-chan.

125
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,640
Well, is Yawara-chan here or not?
Which is it?

126
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,730
W... well, Yawara-san's not 
coming today. Right?

127
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,570
Y... yeah, today is college 
hunting day for seniors.

128
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,410
Damn, she's really not here?

129
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,020
Oh well, I'll be back.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,200
I came all the way here to see her,
but what a waste of effort!

131
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,260
Next time, make it so that I can tell 
whether or not Yawara-chan is here
from the outside, will you?

132
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,830
H... hey, you!

133
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,730
I think it's not respectful to call 
a sempai, "Yawara-CHAN."

134
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,930
Oh, then, if "Yawara-CHAN" isn't good,
then maybe I should say "Yawa-PEE."
Right, sempai dude!

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
H... how dare you!

136
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,540
Don't you... casually... touch 
my shoulder... like that!

137
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,860
No good...

138
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,120
She's late!

139
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,710
Isn't Yawara back yet?

140
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,750
I wonder where she is.

141
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,730
That child! She just had her debut 
and already she's skipping practice.

142
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,750
Maybe she's overwhelmed from
suddenly becoming so popular.

143
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,240
It reminds me of the time when 
Kojiro-san had his debut, too.

144
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,400
Father and daughter both wandering about... those greenhorns!

145
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,460
Ah... Isn't there a guy out there that can
get rid of these heavy feelings?

146
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,330
Kazamatsuri-san?

147
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,720
Yeah right!

148
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,240
He's a judo coach, and so cool, a total stud!

149
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,040
He whispered in my ear, "You have
such beautiful hair, Kyoko-san!

150
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,260
You have a hidden, alluring
quality about you."

151
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,070
Me too!

152
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,600
He said, "It's the first time I've seen anyone with such beautiful completion!

153
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,470
If you diet, you'll probably make 
many men go stir-crazy for you!"

154
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,150
You guys were told, too?!

155
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,060
He said, "Kazumi-san, you're hiding such special things behind those glasses.

156
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,110
Don't keep it to yourself; 
take off your glasses!"

157
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,680
What is he, anyway?

158
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,040
But, Kazamatsuri-san cares about you.

159
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,210
Yup. He said to please take 
care of Yawara-san.

160
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,280
He said that you're his special person, 
so please stay good friends with her.

161
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,970
R... really?

162
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,760
Oh, look at you, being all happy!

163
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,980
I'm jealous!

164
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,440
Hey girls!

165
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,080
You seem to be having fun.

166
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,940
Can we join in?

167
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,990
Let's do something, baby-baby, okay?

168
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,110
That's pathetic.

169
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,390
Was that you're pick-up line or something?

170
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,620
That's right.

171
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,450
Come on, let's go out, huh?

172
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,710
Hold on...

173
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,930
Country boy.

174
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,100
How dare you!

175
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,380
Wait up!

176
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,620
Are you okay?

177
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,400
That was slick!

178
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,460
Even though he's not my type.

179
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,250
Hope you didn't get hurt.

180
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,270
Th... thank you. We weren't hurt at all.

181
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,690
No problem at all.

182
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,130
What do you think you're doing!

183
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,170
I touched Yawara-chan!

184
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,710
Who are you?

185
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,200
I'm Yawara-chan's fan club member 
number 1, freshmen C class, Sudoh.

186
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,190
Nice to meet you!

187
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,930
Don't give me that! Don't call yourself
a fan after touching someone's butt!

188
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,210
Hey, hey. Just don't do an 
ippon zeoi on me, okay?

189
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,540
Wait just a second!

190
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,450
Your aggressiveness turns me on even more!

191
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,410
Yawara!

192
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,890
Oh! Ever since I saw you on the sports news, my heart went pitter-patter!

193
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,710
Sign my boxers next time! See ya!



194
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,510
What was that all about?

195
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,770
Unbelievable.

196
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,810
Pervert!

197
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,650
What's with him?

198
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,740
Uhh, those wishing to join, please write 
your name and class on this sheet.

199
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,900
Wh. what did you say? So, you let yourself 
get thrown by a freshmen yesterday?

200
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,790
Y... yes.

201
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,140
And you just let him go after that?

202
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,100
Y... yes, but he was really strong in judo...

203
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,720
And he was a bit scary-looking. Right?

204
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,970
Y... yeah.

205
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,060
What a shame! The first disgrace of our judo club ever since it's establishment!

206
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,800
A total shame!

207
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,900
I was momentarily happy to see
the crowd wishing to join, but...

208
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,720
Is that Sudoh guy in there?

209
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,080
No, it doesn't seem like he's here yet.


210
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,180
All right then! I'll go nab 
him and pound him up!

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,890
Wait a minute! He's really strong!

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,260
What if something happens to you, Hanazono-san?

213
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,690
Are you saying that I'll lose?

214
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,400
We're not saying that. But even 
with that, Hanazono-san...

215
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,650
You can't do much with that injury.

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,630
Darnit! Why'd I have to break 
my leg at a time like this!

217
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,710
Really.

218
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,640
How did you break it?

219
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,530
It was a highly honorable wound.

220
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,340
Honorable..

221
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,610
..wound?

222
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,940
It was on the way back from visiting 
Dameda College yesterday...
[Dameda College : literally, No Good College]

223
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,130
A little kitty stepped onto the road, 
about to get run over by a large truck!

224
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,120
"Watch out, kitty!"

225
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,270
So that's how you hurt it.

226
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,450
You're so kind, Hanazono-san.

227
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,360
I'm not done with the story yet.

228
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,480
I let the kitty go at a safe place and said, "Take care! Don't get onto the road again!"

229
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,250
I waved at it for a long time, 
and right after that...

230
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,170
A ditch!

231
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,280
It hurts bad! And, it's deep, too!

232
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
It hurts bad! And, it's deep, too!
So what part of that was honorable?

233
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,250
It hurts bad! And, it's deep, too!

234
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,970
Anyways! Bring that Sudoh guy over here!

235
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,880
He'll come here eventually...

236
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,150
Since his objective is Yawara-san.

237
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,170
What!? Yawara-san!?

238
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,330
Y... yes. Sudoh said he came to join
because of Yawara-san.

239
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,620
Wha... what a half-hearted reason!

240
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,870
But he's not the only one. All of them
are joining for the same reason, too.

241
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,110
H... how putrid!

242
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,270
What do they of Yawara-san?

243
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,680
Those people!

244
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,290
Those with such thoughts need not join!

245
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:47,390
Those with such thoughts need not join!
Hanazono-san!

246
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,340
Hanazono-san!

247
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,380
They want to join, you know.

248
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,700
Let me go! Don't stop me!

249
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,270
Even without my leg, I'll use my right
hand to pound and crush them!

250
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,170
You're gonna crush what?

251
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,060
I'm gonna pound and crush him..
and in the name of our Musashi...

252
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,500
And? How are you gonna pound me?

253
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,870
It's Sudoh!

254
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,710
What? You're Sudoh?

255
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,700
The one who raided our dojo and
insulted the innocent Yawara-san?

256
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,350
Who the hell are you, getting all hot? You, 
nor the judo club, owns Yawara-chan.

257
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,980
She's everyone's idol!

258
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,350
Get the facts straight, mohawk dude!

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,470
Don't mess with me!

260
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,970
You're too ugly to mess with anyways.

261
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,990
Why you..!

262
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,150
Ha... Hanazono-san!


263
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,130
By the way, she's late, isn't she? 
I wonder if she's coming today?

264
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,200
Oh well. Whatever.

265
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,740
Please, isn't there any way you can?

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,270
There were over a 100 students wishing to join, too, and I was in a dilemma... so... please?

267
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,680
W... well, you know, they wanted 
to join just to be with you.

268
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,700
You're asking for too much.

269
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,930
I... I know.. but wouldn't you want to show 
off your talents before you graduate?

270
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,810
Wouldn't you like to lead the judo
club to victory and change your 
choice to an athletic college?

271
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,660
Never!

272
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,190
Coach!

273
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,110
What? Hanazono-kun was
taken down by a freshmen?

274
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,780
He was ruthless! He kicked
the injured leg...

275
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,570
... and kept stepping on it 
when he was down.

276
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,160
Yawara-san, please help us!

277
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,840
What?

278
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,540
Eventually, he'll surely 
destroy our judo club.

279
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,290
That Sudoh's still roaming about, 
demanding to see you.

280
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,140
S... Sudoh?

281
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,660
Freshmen C class, Sudoh.

282
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,440
Nice to meet you!

283
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,190
Sign my boxers next time!

284
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,230
Only you can go up against him, Yawara-san!

285
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,540
I know our judo club sucks, but to have a punk like him destroy it breaks my heart.

286
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,970
I'd want to... I'd want to...

287
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,790
Why? Why do I have to fight him?

288
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,050
Why?

289
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,350
Yawara-san!

290
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,580
Inokuma.

291
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,090
Why?

292
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,040
Why do I have to lead the judo team?

293
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,920
And, why do I have to fight 
with a bad boy like him?

294
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,280
Impressive!

295
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,510
Are these what established you 
as the Queen of athletics?

296
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,940
Oh, it's not much, really.

297
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,980
I got rid of most of the items last year, 
but I regained all those this year.

298
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,900
Impressive!

299
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,090
Not only have you climbed to the top, but you've defended the status consistently!

300
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,080
Serve the guest the cookies 
imported from Denmark.

301
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,560
Yes, Miss.

302
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,800
You are definitely Japan's 
home grown sports genius!

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,330
Serve the French import, maron glase.

304
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,850
Even that Florence Joyner pales 
in comparison to you!

305
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,120
Make sure to add lots of gold 
sprinkles to that maron glase.

306
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:32,770
Yes, Miss.



307
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,270
As I've stated, I'd really like to 
have you join our judo club!

308
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,570
What do you think, Kazamatsuri-san?

309
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,440
The Saikai College Judo Club's track 
record and staff are top notch...

310
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,210
... so it would be one of the best places 
to further improve your skills.

311
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,400
If Kazamatsuri-san says so, then...

312
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,760
I am very pleased. If you join my club,
then we will be invincible!

313
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,380
Now, if Yawara-san joins us, too, 
everything will be perfect!

314
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,460
What did you say?

315
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,020
Coach Yuutenji, are you going 
to go recruit Yawara-san?

316
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,060
What? Oh yes! She doesn't have
enough official records for me to 
recommend her for a scholarship...

317
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,820
...but I'm hoping that she'll be in
a special tournament soon!

318
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,590
I see. Yawara-san might go to
Saikai College, huh?

319
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,500
Don't kid me!

320
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,140
Take back the maron glase!

321
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:24,770
Yes, Miss.

322
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,830
Coach Yuutenji!

323
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,560
I refuse your offer!

324
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,230
Kamata! Kamata, are you there?

325
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,220
You called, Miss?

326
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,990
The guest is now leaving. 
Personally drag him out.

327
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,090
Gotcha, Miss.

328
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,860
This is not funny! How dare he two-time 
me with Inokuma Yawara!

329
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,010
Kazamatsuri-san!

330
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,020
Y... yes?

331
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,230
I'm going to Paris right now!

332
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,800
To P... Paris?

333
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,610
At my extra mansion in Paris, 
I'll train for the next tournament.

334
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,600
Next tournament?

335
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,200
I will not let her get a scholarship so easily!

336
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,890
Kazamatsuri-san, you'll come
with me, won't you?

337
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,720
Yawara?

338
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,540
Yes?

339
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,880
The bath is ready.

340
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:11,750
Okay.

341
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,520
Yawara-chan's nude!

342
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,560
Intruder!

343
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,540
Wait you little punk! Wait, I say!

344
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,610
Yawara-chan, please forgive my lust for you! My body just guided me here!

345
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,490
Ouch!

346
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,040
Him again!

347
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,910
See ya!

348
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,180
What a fast rat bastard! If he ever comes again, I'll treat him with my special moves!

349
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,040
What a well-built man!

350
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,480
Wait for me, won't you?

351
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,150
What is this?

352
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,010
Hello, Inokuma residence.

353
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,240
It's me!



354
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm so excited to talk with you, Yawara-chan!

355
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,920
It was nice seeing you just now. Oh yeah, I joined that wimpy judo club just to see you.

356
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,450
So come on, let's do some ne 
waza practices, won't you?
[ne waza : pin down]

357
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,120
C'mon, Yawara-chan. Are you listening...

358
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,630
Yawara, what's wrong?

359
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,930
Nothing!

360
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,830
Scumbag!

361
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,380
Miss, the meal is served in the lounge.

362
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,770
There's no time.

363
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,670
Huh?

364
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,940
Tell the pilot to hurry it up.

365
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,480
Y... yes, Miss.

366
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,170
Oh geez, I hate being stalked by that weirdo! That's why I didn't want to debut!

367
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,000
Yawara-chan.

368
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,460
You again!

369
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,730
You can't do an ippon zeoi
in this cramped crowd.

370
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:19,740
You can't do an ippon zeoi
in this cramped crowd.
Geez!

371
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,030
Geez!

372
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,860
So, come on, let's get to know each other!

373
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,130
If you try anything to me, I'll scream!

374
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,920
Don't be so tense, Yawara-chan!

375
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,150
You gotta take care of your fans, 
right Yawara-chan?

376
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,450
Right, Yawara-chan!

377
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,550
Yawara?

378
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,390
Yawara? The one that threw Yuki Tohdoh?

379
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,590
That ippon zeoi girl, Yawara Inokuma?

380
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,270
That's right!

381
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,420
Everyone, she is Yawara Inokuma!

382
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,390
Geez!

383
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,310
That's it! Now I'm mad!

384
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,360
What are you doing?

385
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,360
Please don't get so violent!

386
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,700
I am not being violent!

387
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,530
Hurry up and change into your dogis!
[dogis : judo uniforms]

388
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,030
Y... yes, ma'am!

389
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,300
You'd better watch out, Sudoh!

390

391

392
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,850
What's that?

393
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,850
Training starts tomorrow! Oh yeah, we should do early morning sessions, too!

394
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,820
Yawara! What's with you, Yawara?

395
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,940
Sudoh, you'll be pounded to pulp and...

396
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,720
Pounded to pulp?

397
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,270
... will be unable to move...

398
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,070
Unable to move?

399
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,570
... until you squeal!

400
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,120
Squeal?

401
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,630
Watch out, Sudoh!

402
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,720
