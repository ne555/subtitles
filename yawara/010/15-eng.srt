1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,550
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,350
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,450
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,850
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,300
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,050
Yawara-san, you will be in the
next tournament, right?

10
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,080
What are they...?

11
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,060
Stop it, you delinquent girl!

12
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,310
You're all crazy. Here's some towels! 
Use this umbrella, too!

13
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,230
Inokuma!

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,020
For God's sake..!

15
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,960
Yawara-san!

16
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,010
Oh, Yawara-san! Yawara-san! 
Please, Yawara-san!

17
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,570
Tomorrow.. let's meet at the 
school dojo at 5am, okay?

18
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,790
Episode 15
A Challenge to Yawara Over Love!

19
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,650
Musashiyama High School

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,580
So, this is the Musashiyama High School that Inokuma YOKOREMBO Yawara goes to, correct?
YOKOREMBO -- illicit love

21
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,670
Yes indeed, Miss.

22
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,190
I... Inokuma DOROBO-NEKO Yawara!
DOROBO-NEKO -- cat thief

23
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,040
I will teach you once and for all.. 
that's what's mine is mine!

24
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,040
Err, this is Inokuma Yawara-san, our official coach for our judo club from today.

25
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,720
Wow, Yawara-san!

26
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,230
She's cute!

27
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,680
Gorgeous!

28
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,040
..and sharpen our skills, and sweat together..



29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,360
What the heck are you doing?

30
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,460
Well, I was thinking of putting a picture 
of Yawara-san in my wallet.

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,800
How dare you..!

32
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,170
What in the world are you thinking...

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,310
Yawara-san! Yawara-san!

34
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,870
U... umm, could I have your autograph?

35
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,150
U... umm, could I have your autograph?
Hey guys, don't be so pushy.

36
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,360
Hey guys, don't be so pushy.

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,770
Hey! W... what did you join the judo club for?

38
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,290
Well, obviously, because..

39
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,680
We wanted to spend our youth 
with Yawara-sempai! Please!

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,470
We wanted to spend our youth 
with Yawara-sempai! Please!
This school is rather dirty.

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,770
This school is rather dirty.

42
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,230
Well, Miss, compared to your school, 
Seishin Jyo-Gakukan..

43
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,860
And, it kind of smells, too.

44
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,960
Well, compared to Seishin Jyo-Gakukan..

45
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,490
Oh my gosh, it's co-ed!

46
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,640
All the guys look like such losers.

47
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,610
Hey look, a real babe!

48
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,840
That uniform is Seishin Jyo-Gakukan!

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,200
Err, the judo club dojo is at..

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,820
Let's finish up the matter quickly 
so we can go home, Miss..

51
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,930
Miss... Ahh!

52
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,050
Hey girl! Won't you have some tea with us?

53
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,920
Oh, Miss!


54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,750
Nice timing. Do you people know 
where the judo club dojo is?

55
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,940
We know, we know!

56
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,530
It's that shack behind the gym.

57
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,660
Forget that. Let's go eat some oshiruko.
oshiruko -- cold sweet bean soup with 
rice cake dumplings

58
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,290
Come on!

59
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,520
Come on!
No! Stay away!

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,670
No! Stay away!

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,910
What are you trying to do to her!

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,400
Who's this old geezer?

63
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,630
M... Miss, let's go home!

64
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,320
That's why I hesitated to bring
you to a place like this!

65
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,180
Whaddya mean by "a place like this"?

66
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,180
C'mon, let's go eat some oshiruko!

67
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,400
O... okay then!

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,930
If you must then I shall go eat 
oshiruko with you!

69
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,510
Y... yeah right! Why do we have 
to eat oshiruko with you!

70
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,930
Let's be friends...

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,580
Miss!

72
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,340
To be friends with me, you're 10..
no a 100 years too early!

73
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,570
Th... this is supposed to be the judo hall?

74
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,150
Even my beloved dog, Charles, 
wouldn't live in such a dump!

75
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,080
Yes indeed.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,750
Oh well. I need to have a word
with Inokuma Yawara.

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,060
O... oh, Miss, please keep it peaceful!

78
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,850
Tokunaga, open it. Even the doorknob is dirty.

79
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,510
Yes.


80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,190
We'll die if we do anything more!

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,130
We quit the club!

82
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,280
To... Tokunaga, what was that?

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,360
Wait!

84
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,500
I'm sorry! I'll make it easier,
so please come back!

85
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,030
Let them go, Inokuma! We don't need 
anybody that can't handle your training.

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,930
That's right, Yawara-san.

87
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,900
The summer tournament preliminaries 
are coming up, so please don't 
worry and train us harder.

88
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,470
But, over a hundred people joined,
and they all quit.

89
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,190
The only new member that stayed is Sudoh-kun.

90
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,640
100 pushups, 100 bridge pushups.. 
and 1000 mock throwing..

91
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,170
Those softie Yawara-chan followers 
can't handle that.

92
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,250
You need to be a hard-core fan like me to...

93
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,350
Don't act so cool while you're barfing!

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,050
Hanazono-kun!

95
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,070
To break my leg at a time like this, 
Inokuma, and not train with you,
makes me feel so ashamed.

96
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,840
Sayaka-san!

97
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,230
What are you trying to do 
with those sweaty boys?

98
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,640
W... why?

99
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,490
I've come here today to speak 
to you about something.

100
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,820
Matsuda-san, how do you plan to pull Yawara-san into the tournament?

101
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,010
How should I know!

102
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,440
It's all Kazamatsuri, that pervert's fault!

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,930
Because he tried to do something to Yawara-san, everything's down the drain!


104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,180
But, who knew that Yawara-san
had a crush on Kazamatsuri!

105
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,930
Good looking guys are so lucky. We should 
be jealous, huh, Matsuda-san?

106
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,990
Kamoda! You're pretty persistent. 
Why should I be jealous, huh?

107
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,810
I don't have any special feelings toward her!

108
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,990
She's just...

109
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,560
News material, right?

110
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,810
Th... that's right. That's exactly right.

111
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,950
But, you know..

112
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,190
But what?

113
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,420
Ever since you found out abouther feelings toward Kazamatsuri, you seem a bit irritated..

114
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,940
W... what part of me is irritated?

115
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,750
She's just a high schooler.

116
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,660
Why do I have to get irritated over such a kid?!

117
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,970
Wha... what is it?

118
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,110
Look at that!

119
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,100
Hon'ami Sayaka!


120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,090
What is she here for?

121
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,160
Seems like something might happen.

122
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,060
What is it that you wanted to talk about?

123
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,270
Don't give me that attitude, especially since you're trying to steal what's mine.

124
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,160
I have no idea what you're talking about.

125
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,500
I'm talking about Kazamatsuri-san.


126
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,630
From now on, please stop enticing him.

127
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,200
I have not done that!

128
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,180
What's wrong, Inokuma?

129
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,490
What's wrong, Inokuma?
Hey, what a pretty chick.

130
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,040
Hey, what a pretty chick.

131
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,420
Oh look, you have so many
wonderful boyfriends.

132
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,600
You have an Easter Island 
Stone Face big man and..

133
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,750
A street gangster.. what a perfect match!

134
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,820
You're a street gangster!

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,320
You're a Stone Face!

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,100
What the heck is that?!

137
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,520
What the heck is that?!
Hold it!

138
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:29,900
Hold it!

139
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,570
Sayaka-san, what are you trying to say?

140
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,100
Stop trying to allure Kazamatsuri-san.

141
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,990
I never tried to allure him.

142
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,730
This is more intense than a judo match!

143
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,350
An extremely volatile confrontation 
between love-rivals!

144
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,350
Dammit, why is a pervert like 
Kazamatsuri so popular, eh?

145
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,720
See, you're irritated ... Oww!

146
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,590
H... Hi, Daily Every reporters!

147
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,090
Sayaka-san didn't happen to 
come by here, did she?

148
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,420
I heard that she wanted to come 
here to speak to Yawara-san..

149
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,270
Heheh, that's exactly what's happening.

150
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,720
They're throwing sparks over you as I speak.

151
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,060
There, take a closer look, you perv!

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,470
There, there!

153
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,860
Hmph. You probably have no intention of being in the next tournament anyway.

154
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,020
Acting as if you're going to be 
in the tournament, just to get Kazamatsuri-san's attention.


155
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,450
My, what a kniving scheme!

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
Kazamatsuri?

157
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,170
But, it won't be like that anymore.

158
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,860
I've always gotten what I've wanted.

159
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,390
And I always will.. forever!

160
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,280
Do you understand, Kazamatsuri-san is mine!

161
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,640
Do... you... understand?

162
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,320
So, stop getting attention by playing around on your decision of being in the tournament or not.

163
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,810
If you don't want to be in it, fine. Don't.

164
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,410
It's already a fact that I'm Number 1
in Japan for judo.

165
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,780
It's because I have Kazamatsuri-san 
as my strong ally.

166
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,630
Hey, hey. Don't give us your selfish crap.

167
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,000
The Number 1 in Japan is 
Yawara-chan, you dork!

168
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,510
A street gangster like you has 
no right calling me a dork.

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,200
Inokuma Yawara! If you so desire, we can settle this right here, right now!

170
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,540
Screw you! Yawara-san doesn't 
need to fight you.


171
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,440
I'll bust that snobby nose of yours...

172
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,750
Hey, Sudoh! Straighten up! You OK?

173
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,770
So.. Do you now know how strong I am?

174
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,870
Well, let's go home, Tokunaga.

175
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,850
If we stay at this dirty place any longer,
we might get sick.

176
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,380
Y... yes, Miss.

177
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,010
Tokunaga, when we get home,
disinfect all of our clothes.

178
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,620
Yes.

179
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,490
Wait.

180
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,720
I haven't played around with 
my feelings for attention.

181
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,770
And.. I've already decided..

182
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,820
I will.. be in.. the next tournament!

183
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,300
I want to find out if I shine 
brilliantly when I do judo.

184
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,180
Just this time.. I'll do it.

185
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,210
Hmph, then I can soon make it clear
that I'm Number 1 in Japan..

186
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,440
... in front of everyone in Japan..

187
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,450
..in two weeks, at the National Martial Arts Hall!

188
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,820
Prepare yourself for this fight.

189
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,500
D... did you hear that, huh?

190
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,660
M... Matsuda-san, you're shaking the camera.

191
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,320
Hmm. It seems as if my date worked, after all.

192
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,540
Why are you looking like that?

193
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,260
Aren't you supposed to be a bit more grateful?

194
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,870
You're jealous, aren't you, Matsuda-san?

195
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,900
Oww, oww, oww!

196
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,100
Soon To Confront!!
Hon'ami vs Inokuma!!
Both throwing sparks at Musashiyama High Judo Hall
The One Showing Weakness Shall Lose

197
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,700
Soon To Confront!!
Hon'ami vs Inokuma!!
Both throwing sparks at Musashiyama High Judo Hall
The One Showing Weakness Shall Lose
Everything is going as calculated.

198
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,750
Soon To Confront!!
Hon'ami vs Inokuma!!
Both throwing sparks at Musashiyama High Judo Hall
The One Showing Weakness Shall Lose

199
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,930
To sharpen one's skills by fighting rivals opens up the path to the gold medal 
and National Achievement Award.

200
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,060
That Kaza-midori or Kaza-matsuri or whatever..

201
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,550
Yawara must have finally discovered that 
she can't waste time on a guy anymore.

202
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,160
Kazamatsuri-san!

203
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,200
Fifteen years since I've started judo...

204
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,360
I finally have to tie on a black belt...

205
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,230
Begin!


206
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,750
..since Grandpa said that it wouldn't be cool to wear a white belt at the National Martial Arts Hall.

207
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,310
Ippon!
Ippon -- a win, full 10 points


208
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,330
That's Inokuma Yawara?

209
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,320
I... Incredible!

210
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,550
Don't go wild over just a first degree black belt.

211
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,820
Yawara's ability is 4th degree, no, 5th degree..

212
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,670
Heck, she's already 6th degree!


213
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,230
That's not true! I'm not that strong, really.

214
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,170
Don't be so modest, Yawara.

215
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,320
One of you must be 4th degree or 5th degree.

216
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,680
Just throw them and show your true strength.

217
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,900
Grandpa!

218
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,110
Hey wait, we shouldn't waste time 
earning one rank at a time.

219
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,240
Let's jump straight to 6th degree and go home.


220
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,160
Won't somebody fight Yawara?

221
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,260
Grandpa, that's enough!

222
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,940
Ranking exams need to be 
passed for each rank up...

223
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,010
... and I can only get up to 2nd degree
until I'm 20 years old.

224
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,310
... and I can only get up to 2nd degree
until I'm 20 years old.
Eii! Everyone here is so spineless!

225
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,570
Eii! Everyone here is so spineless!

226
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,310
Quiet down over there!

227
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,510
Oh, it was you, Inokuma-sensei?

228
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:28,550
Oh, it was you, Inokuma-sensei?
What degree are you?

229
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,630
What degree are you?

230
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm 5th degree, but..?

231
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,290
Great! Then you go against Yawara!

232
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,930
Grandpa!

233
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,780
I'm sorry, he's just blabbing nonsense.

234
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,960
Yawara, don't apologize. You really 
are 6th degree or more.

235
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,780
Yawara, don't apologize. You really 
are 6th degree or more.
Grandpa!

236
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,060
Grandpa!

237
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,110
Grandpa!
Hurry up and change into your judo outfit!

238
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,340
Hurry up and change into your judo outfit!

239
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,930
Geez, Grandpa!

240
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,340
Recently, I feel like Grandpa's pawn.

241
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,610
But..

242
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,580
You shine most brilliantly when you do judo.

243
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,410
Kazamatsuri-san!

244
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,010
Yawara-chan!

245
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,120
Oh, you finished changing already?

246
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,920
Inokuma..

247
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,730
We missed it, Hanazono-san.

248
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,720
Eh? That's not what I came for!

249
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,690
By the way, Inokuma, the date for the 
summer tournament preliminaries is set.

250
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,090
The first round is next Sunday, against Todoroki-dai Kita High School.

251
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,800
Is that a strong team?

252
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,500
Compared to our pathetic team, 
any team is stronger...

253
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,540
We are no longer our old selves.

254
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,590
Because of Inokuma, we all became stronger!

255
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,770
Oh.. really...?

256
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,420
Don't laugh weakly! Be more confident!

257
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,390
But, you know, we never won 
any official games yet, so..

258
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,450
It'll be okay. You've all worked so hard. 
All of you should be really strong now.

259
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,820
Th... that's true.

260
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,230
We endured all of Yawara-san's training..

261
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,540
..and, we just need to follow Yawara-san's instructions during the match.

262
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,620
You'll come right, Yawara-san?

263
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,500
Of course! I don't know if I can help you, 
but I'll be there to cheer you on!

264
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,050
Definitely, on next Sunday -- ah?

265
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,000
Next Sunday?!

266
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,540
O.oh yeah! The same day as YOUR tournament!

267
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,260
What time is your match?

268
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,840
It's an afternoon match, so it's from 3pm.


269
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,800
The Martial Arts Hall matches start from 12pm, and the number of matches are..

270
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,910
It's okay, I think I can make it.

271
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,920
Don't push it, Inokuma! You should just concentrate on your matches!

272
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,570
But, if Yawara-san isn't there..

273
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,450
Don't depend on her. Just leave it to me!

274
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,210
Heh! What can a fractured gorilla like you do?

275
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,470
Say what? It's your fault that 
my leg hasn't healed yet!

276
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,040
It's your fault for being such an idiot!

277
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,040
What did you say?!

278
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,770
This is not the time to fight 
amongst yourselves!

279
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,500
Anyway, I'll come as soon as 
I finish my matches, okay?

280
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,840
So, to prepare for the matches, 
let's do the last bit of fine tuning.


281
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,410
Let's drive on, okay!

282
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,980
..o.ohh..

283
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,120
I can't hear you!

284
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,140
OHH! 
OHH -- yeah

285
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,790
Next person, come on!

286
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,620
It's almost perfect.

287
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,790
My coaching is excellent, but Sayaka-san's ability to absorb all of it amazing too.

288
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,850
I'm not exaggerating to say that both 
of our extreme talents came together
in her to produce such results.

289
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,420
I guess this explains why Sayaka-san's 
father took a liking to me.

290
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,310
Nowadays, my Sayaka seems so lively. Especially since she usually
gets bored so easily.

291
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,610
But this time, this judo, is different.

292
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,230
It seems that your coaching and your
presence has affected her greatly.

293
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,590
I'm humbled.

294
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,100
Look out this window.

295
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:56,670
Ferrari's new model. It's not sold in 
Japan yet, but just take it.

296
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,960
It's your bonus.

297
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,060
Th... that's.. for me?

298
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,230
Is it not enough?

299
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,550
N... no, it's more than enough!

300
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,870
Thank you very much!

301
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,780
By the way, how's this..

302
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,960
Won't you permanently stay
in the Hon'ami Group?

303
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,690
You're graduating college this year, right?

304
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,140
Yes..

305
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,250
Eventually, I'd like you to take 
on an important position..

306
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,310
..since I'm sold on your skills 
of developing Sayaka well.

307
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,780
I'm honored.

308
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,000
And, this is also an eventual thing, but..

309
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,590
Yes?

310
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,720
Won't you please guide my Sayaka forever?

311
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,290
Forever... meaning?

312
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,200
Well, I'm asking if you could keep that intention in mind when you keep her company.

313
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,160
Unless, you have a person like that already?

314
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,070
N... no, not at all!

315
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,120
Well then, that's wonderful. My Hon'ami Group's future is in safe hands then.

316
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,990
Oh yes, I'll give you another bonus next month. How would you like a cruise ship?

317
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,700
Cruise ship? That's great!

318
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,320
Kazamatsuri-san!

319
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,450
Something wrong?

320
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,550
N... no.. nothing, really.




321
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm done with randori.
randori -- free sparring

322
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,730
How did I do?

323
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,460
It's perfect.. almost.

324
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,750
Almost? I threw all the men skill fully, 
but it's still "almost"?

325
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,220
I think it's absolutely perfect!

326
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,860
If it's a regular opponent, that is.

327
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,430
But, your opponent in three days 
will be that Inokuma Yawara.

328
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,920
Oh, that's right. It's that girl you 
tried to kiss, Inokuma Yawara...

329
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,000
As I said before! That was just to 
convince her to be in the tournament..

330
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,390
Oh well, I settled that matter 
with her the other day.

331
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,030
Anyway, I will defeat Inokuma Yawara
and become Number 1 in Japan..

332
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,430
..since, there's nothing I cannot get a hold of!

333
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,900
..since, there's nothing I cannot get a hold of!
Ahh, that's it!

334
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,860
Ahh, that's it!

335
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,710
What?

336
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,830
N... no..

337
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,400
Well, it's time for some tea.

338
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,430
Tokunaga, prepare some tea.

339
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,050
Yes, Miss Sayaka.

340
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,340
There's nothing that she can't get a hold of.. she must have asked her father to get me.

341
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,090
Hon'ami Group's important position..
is a pretty good offer.

342
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,680
But, what is this nagging feeling in my heart?


343
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,870
Matsuda! What is this wimpy article?

344
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:50,150
Your enthusiasm over Inokuma Yawara used to pour out from between the lines!

345
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,020
Are you slacking off, huh?

346
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,300
In your case, you need to indulge yourself into liking the news material more and more and more-

347
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,520
Chief..

348
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,290
Matsuda-san got dumped by Yawara-san..

349
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,950
I know that, Chief! You don't
have to tell me twice!

350
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:09,410
I still like Inokuma Yawara.. the judo athlete!



351
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,110
Ever since I first saw you, 
my enthusiasm hasn't changed.

352
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,710
Ever since I.. first saw you.

353
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,390
Ka... Kamoda!

354
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,050
G... gotcha!

355
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,420
But.. another feeling has mixed
into that enthusiasm.

356
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,660
That's what made my article so wimpy.

357
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,050
Yawara-san! You can't stay 
where I can reach you.

358
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,840
You need to go farther away.

359
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,220
Yeah, to a really faraway place.

360
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,300
But, that'll happen real soon.

361
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,470
You'll definitely become an
almost unreachable person.

362
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,970
Tomorrow, at this National Martial Arts Hall.

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,020
901 Days to the Barcelona Olympics

364
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,670
What? Sudoh-kun got hurt?

365
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,870
Finally.. finally, your debut at the 
National Martial Arts Hall, Yawara!

366
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,450
Hey, Yawara!

367
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,350
But if Sudoh-kun can't do it, then there's not enough people to do the team match!

368
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,560
You don't have time to be 
involved with that bunch!

369
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,130
Why can't you show your good face to the audience in the National Martial Arts Hall?

370
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,280
Why can't you show your good face to the audience in the National Martial Arts Hall?
But, but..!

371
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,420
But, but..!

372
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,680
Yawara! Are you listening, Yawara?

373
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,100
Next time, on "Yawara!"...

374
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,230
Yawara's National Martial Arts Hall Debut!

375
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,960
If you don't watch it, I'll do
