1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,650
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,900
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,400
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,450
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,850
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,400
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,430
Hon'ami Sayaka, Tohdoh Yuki, 
and Inokuma Yawara.

10
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,650
Each has won past the second round.

11
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,490
This women's judo tournament is 
about to get more interesting.

12
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,210
Bow!

13
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,320
Hanazono-kun.

14
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,020
Yawara-san, it's no good after all.

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,710
What should we do?

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,800
NO! It's okay! We're not going to waste Inokuma's efforts of coaching this team!

17
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,020
Ippon!

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,350
She did it!

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,920
Inokuma Yawara, with an ippon zeoi, 
has easily made it to the final round.

20
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,970
And, in the second semi-finals match, 
we have the intense rivalry between 
Hon'ami Sayaka and Tohdoh Yuki.

21
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,720
Who is going to fight the extremely 
strong Inokuma Yawara?

22
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,680
Episode 17
Yawara's Love Message

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,070
Yes... that's right.

24
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,190
I would like to speak to a Musashiyama 
High team member, please.

25
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,370
They've already entered the arena.

26
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,190
Is there any way to speak to them?

27
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,410
They're in a match already, so...

28
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,580
I see. Sorry to bother you.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,330
That was very wonderful!

30
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,390
Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!

31
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,780
Yawara-san, with your expert techniques, nobody can stop you!

32
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,580
Kazamatsuri-san.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,520
You are shining... very brilliantly!

34
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,620
The semi-final match between Sayaka-san 
and Tohdoh Yuki is about to begin.

35
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,850
This may sound bad, being Sayaka-san's coach, but neither of them will be able to beat you...

36
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,700
... because you shine so brilliantly.

37
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,660
Kazamatsuri-san, I..

38
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,110
What's wrong? Let's go watch 
the semi-finals together.

39
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,410
Everyone, cheer up! It's okay.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,500
Every one of you has the power to win.

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
I.. Inokuma.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,030
I.. Inokuma.
I.. It's Yawara-san's voice!

43
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,500
I.. It's Yawara-san's voice!

44
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,140
Everyone, listen carefully...

45
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,170
Everyone, listen carefully...
Yawara-san!

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,740
Yawara-san!

47
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,750
Hey! Stop caressing the tape player!

48
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,550
It's all your fault this happened
in the first place!

49
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,790
But Yawara-san is more worried about 
your matches than hers.

50
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,860
Don't you guys understand her feelings and want to win one for her, like a man?

51
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,900
Inokuma! She cares so much about us!

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,370
She's so... she's so..

53
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,930
Idiots! If you wanna be a man, don't cry
like that! Yawara-san is trying hard, 
so follow her example!

54
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,260
How are Inokuma's matches going?

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,260
Don't worry about her. She should have made her way to the finals with all ippon victories.

56
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,620
This tape player has crucial advice 
for you guys on how to win.

57
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,620
Especially for you and your injured leg, Hanazono-kun!



58
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,600
Take her feelings and words 
to heart and win for her!

59
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,270
If you lose, I'll get on your case!

60
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:41,860
We will now begin the seventh preliminary match between Musashiyama High 
and Todorokidai Kita High.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,550
Okay, that fired me up!

62
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,790
Let's go get 'em, everyone!

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,210
Ei, ei, oh! Ei, ei, oh!
[Ei, ei, oh! -- group pep cheer]

64
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,220
Your long, shabby hair is in the way. 
Can't you do something about it?

65
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,580
What's more in the way is your huge potbelly.

66
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,610
What did you say? Are you taking
judo seriously at all?

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,530
Hey! Refrain from personal comments!

68
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,220
And you have makeup on! 
My dogi will get dirty!

69
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,710
It's a cheap one anyway. If you need it cleaned, just hand it over to Tokunaga.

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,770
Shut up, you stupid woman!

71
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,590
Calm down now!

72
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,150
S.. such intensity! These two are ready
and fired up to start the match!

73
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,830
I will fight Inokuma Yawara!

74
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,750
I will.


75
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,920
Me!

76
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,120
Me.

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm telling you, it's me!

78
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,290
No, me.

79
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,680
I hope everyone's okay.

80
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,630
See, Yawara-san?

81
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,290
The two of them are getting excited
over you. It's so exhilarating!

82
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,480
Begin!

83
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,450
Whoa! Tohdoh boldly charges!

84
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,220
Unfortunately for you, I'll win this match.


85
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,910
I should say the same to you.

86
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,830
To prove my supremacy in judo and to show that Kazamatsuri-san is mine, I need to...

87
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,940
Oh wow! This is the first time since her debut that Hon'ami Sayaka was taken down!

88
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,010
The giant Tohdoh Yuki is pinning her
with a reverse kesa gatame!
[kesa gatame -- scarf hold]

89
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,630
Hon'ami's in a pinch!

90
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,560
I'll make you cry really.. really hard!



91
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,150
I.. Inokuma Yawara! Enjoy your moment 
next to Kazamatsuri-san, but not for long!

92
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,950
I will not lose!

93
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,690
Whoa! Hon'ami is dragging the 
giant Tohdoh to escape!

94
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,830
I will not lose!

95
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,890
I will not lose! Inokuma Yawara!

96
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,950
Halt!

97
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,120
Out of bounds!

98
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,840
That was close for Hon'ami! She escaped 
the hold by going out of bounds.

99
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,420
Dammit!

100
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,620
I will not lose against her! Not until
I fight Inokuma Yawara!

101
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,760
Dosu-koi!
[Dosu-koi --sumo grunt]

102
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,170
Please, end it soon! It doesn't matter... 
please, just end it soon!

103
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,490
Dammit! What's going on? 
The match is gonna end!

104
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,810
Hanazono-san!

105
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm scared!

106
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,910
Stupid, don't squirm! Th.. th. that's
the most intimidated loses!

107
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,860
Musashiyama High pointman, Hatakeyama-kun.

108
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,060
Musashiyama High pointman, Hatakeyama-kun.
Y.. yes!

109
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,890
Y.. yes!

110
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,680
Y.. Yawara-san!

111
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,860
Hatakeyama, go for it!

112
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:34,940
Hatakeyama, go for it!
Do it right!

113
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,460
Do it right!

114
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:35,710
Do it right!
Drive on!

115
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,760
Drive on!

116
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,500
Hatakeyama! Remember what Yawara-san said!

117
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,220
You'll do fine, Hatakeyama-kun.

118
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,250
You've completely mastered
the okuri ashi barai...
[okuri ashi barai -- trailing foot sweep]

119
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,000
... so just wait for the moment the
opponent shifts to the side.

120
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,090
Don't ever step in forward. Don't worry,
you can do it, Hatakeyama-kun..

121
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,210
Todorokidai Kita High pointman, Yasuhashi-kun.

122
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,440
Todorokidai Kita High pointman, Yasuhashi-kun.
Yes.

123
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,070
Yes.

124
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,900
Uhh, to do the okuri ashi barai, force the opponent to shift to the sides and not the front..

125
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,190
What's with him? What's he babbling about?

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,360
Begin!


127
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,550
Wait for the side.. side shift timing..

128
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,370
The side.. the side...

129
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,830
Oh no, Yawara-san, he's not shifting sideways!

130
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,190
Oh no!

131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Ippon!

132
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,330
Dammit! If I can't write the article because I missed the finals match, I'll get fired for sure!

133
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,240
Hon'ami vs. Tohdoh. Neither is budging 
and it's dragging into a long stretch.

134
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:11,120
Which one will make it to the finals? 
Tohdoh Yuki, or Hon'ami Sayaka?

135
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,600
Me!

136
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,400
Me!

137
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,780
Hurry, hurry up and end it! Please!


138
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,010
The semi-final between Hon'ami and Tohdoh. It's a great rivalry, as expected.

139
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,880
But neither of them show any hint of movement.

140
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,640
I wonder why?



141
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,520
They're not moving because they can't move.

142
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,880
This is turning out to be a great battle!

143
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,300
No, they just suck.

144
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,990
Geez, what are they doing? 
The Musashiyama match will be over.

145
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,870
But, this isn't going anywhere. If only 
they'd be more aggressive..

146
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,640
No, that's too risky. They're at equal levels, 
so they can't risk a move.

147
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,810
Each is waiting for the other
to initiate something.

148
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,950
This match will probably drag 
on for a long time.

149
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,150
Oh... Oh no.

150
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,490
Wait, Hanazono-kun. Where are you going?

151
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,370
What are you two doing? I don't care who wins. Let's get on to the finals match!

152
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,460
Y.. Yawara-san!

153
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:58,170
Th.. this is an unexpected outburst from Inokuma! She's boldly challenging
Hon'ami and Tohdoh!

154
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,140
N.. no, that's not what I meant!


155
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,050
Yawara sure knows how to get to them!

156
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,090
Whoa! It prompted Hon'ami to charge!

157
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,090
Inokuma Yawara! How dare you 
stand out more than me!

158
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,030
I was waiting for you to move, Missy!

159
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,570
Tohdoh! Going for a planned uchi mata! 
[uchi mata -- inner thigh reap]

160
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,330
Hon'ami! Grabbed the hooking leg and...!

161
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,550
Koka!
[Koka -- Partial 3 points!]

162
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,270
Almost! Hon'ami's sukui nage 
wasn't complete, unfortunately.
[sukui nage -- scooping throw]

163
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,530
Attempting to pin her down, but is it possible?

164
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,130
I'm very sorry!

165
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,820
Don't cry, Hatakeyama. It's only the first match.



166
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,990
That's right. We'll just win 
4 in row from here on.

167
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,930
But, I went against Yawara-san's advice 
and charged in from the front.

168
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,690
Everyone, cheer up! It's okay. Every one 
of you has the power to win.

169
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,250
Okay, Yawara-san's voice charged me up!

170
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,430
Hatakeyama, I'll win this one for you!

171
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,540
Hatakeyama, I'll win this one for you!
Musashiyama High second pointman, Kohno-kun.

172
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,140
Musashiyama High second pointman, Kohno-kun.

173
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Musashiyama High second pointman, Kohno-kun.
Oh yeah!!

174
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,440
Oh yeah!!

175
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,510
Because of Yawara-san, he became
really tough, huh?

176
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah.

177
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,630
All right! I'm ready for anything!

178
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,640
Sure.

179
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,380
As I said, I forgot my helmet 
because I was in a hurry!

180
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,220
So you're saying that you don't need 
a helmet if you're hurrying?

181
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,070
No, that's why I apologized several times!

182
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,650
The finals match at the National Martial 
Arts Hall will be over soon!

183
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,960
Oh that. I wanted to see that, too.

184
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,680
Yawara-chan, right? I bought the ticket, 
but I had to work today.

185
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,050
That was a real bummer.

186
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,540
Quit babbling and just write the ticket, dammit!

187
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,370
Despite Tohdoh's weight difference, 
Hon'ami is faring well.

188
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,730
But, can she actually move this giant?

189
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,410
I.. Inokuma Yawara!

190
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,970
I've always got what I wanted.

191
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,340
But, ever since you appeared, 
things have been going astray.

192
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,350
But, that will be the last of it!

193
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,620
There isn't anything in this world
that won't go my way!

194
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,730
Wha-?!

195
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,250
What?!

196
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,190
Sayaka-san!

197
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:38,990
Whoa!

198
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,820
There isn't anything in this world
that won't go my way!

199
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,180
Th.. this can't be!

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,280
I will be the Japanese judo champion 
and have Kazamatsuri-san, too!

201
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,730
Amazing! Hon'ami flipped 
Tohdoh's massive body!

202
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,190
Tohdoh is struggling to break free. 
Can Hon'ami pin her for 30 seconds?

203
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,460
20, 19, 18, 17..!

204
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,610
20, 19, 18, 17..!
And, Sayaka's supporters are counting down! Tohdoh is inching towards the boundaries!

205
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,400
And, Sayaka's supporters are counting down! Tohdoh is inching towards the boundaries!

206
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,450
I will be the one to fight Inokuma Yawara!

207
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,860
I will be the one to fight 
Inokuma Yawara, TODO-san!
[TODO -- sea cow]

208
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,760
I am...!

209
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,770
I am... not a TODO! 
[TODO -- sea cow]

210
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,180
Ippon!

211
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,270
Sayaka-san!

212
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,170
She did it! Hon'ami Sayaka has 
made it to the finals!

213
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,170
She'll go against Inokuma Yawara!

214
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:59,050
Despite having a weight disadvantage, 
she overcame it with strength and 
willpower and won an ippon victory!

215
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,350
Well, it seems that I underestimated 
Hon'ami Sayaka's abilities!

216
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,990
Even though she may have conquered 
other sports, I doubted she'd pull 
it off so easily with judo, but...

217
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,910
It seems that Inokuma Yawara sparked her.

218
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,200
To have a rival to sharpen each other's skills against and become stronger... that's judo!


219
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,970
The outcome of the finals is now unpredictable.

220
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,040
What's there to figure out?

221
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,050
Inokuma Jigoro sensei!

222
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,920
It's going exactly as I planned.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,290
I'm the one who saw judo potential in 
Hon'ami Sayaka and dragged her into it.

224
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,960
I also set her up as Yawara's rival to have them sharpen each other's skills to get stronger.

225
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,140
S.. so you're saying that the outcome of the finals will go along with your plan, too?

226
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,070
Absolutely.



227
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,690
Look, they're already throwing sparks
at each other with this rivalry.

228
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,950
Congratulations, Sayaka-san. Umm,
I don't know what to say, but..

229
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,640
I'll want to receive words of praise 
from you after I beat you.

230
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,970
Well, regardless, that was really great!

231
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,970
I can't wait to see the two of you fight! Really!

232
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,160
Kazamatsuri-san.

233
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,990
Let's discuss our strategy for the 
finals at the waiting room. Alone.

234
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,460
Uh, sure.

235
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,920
I'll teach you in the finals
that what's mine is mine.

236
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
Uhh, w.. wait!

237
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,880
Yuko! 
[Yuko --Partial 5 points!]

238
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,010
Kohno is behind by two yukos, but he's 
still hanging in there, huh?

239
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,170
Kohno, remember what Yawara-san said!

240
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:58,470
Kohno-kun, remember... the stance
with one knee bent, with your feet 
3 and a half footlengths apart.

241
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,660
That's right. I practiced this
move day in and day out!

242
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,500
Yeah, you can do it, Kohno-kun!

243
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,920
Hah! This timing!

244
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,370
Now, Kohno-kun!

245
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,750
Ippon!

246
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,680
All right!

247
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,540
I did it!

248
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:33,400
Musashiyama High, Kohno-kun, tai otoshi ippon. The score is now 1-1.
[tai otoshi -- body drop]

249
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,290
There, Tomioka!

250
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:35,320
There, Tomioka!
Pin him down!

251
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,300
Pin him down!

252
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,590
Don't let go!

253
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,270
Tomioka-kun, your body weight becomes a powerful weapon for the tate shihoh gatame. 
[tate shihoh gatame -- vertical 4 corner hold]

254
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,250
If you put all your weight 
on him, you'll beat him.

255
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,790
Go, Tomioka! Hang in there! Go!

256
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,460
Out of bounds! Halt!

257
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,520
Oh, almost!

258
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:06,030
This is like a dream. These guys are fighting on the same level as Todorokidai Kita High.

259
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,180
These guys...! Inokuma, I owe it all to you! You are absolutely wonderful!



260
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,660
Please! At least take it to 2-2 until my round!

261
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,560
I have to win, even if my leg gets chopped off!



262
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,360
Inokuma, just for you!

263
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,540
Yes, the Musashiyama High match.

264
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,860
Yes.

265
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,610
Yawara.

266
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,330
I'll praise you for making it so far.

267
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,950
Grandpa.

268
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,090
But, Yawara, don't brush off that Miss so easily.

269
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,810
If it was only on strength, you'd surely beat her.


270
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,220
But, that Miss is fired up! She has such 
an intense desire to defeat you!

271
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,670
She really is a fearful rival!

272
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,830
Yeah, she sure is a fearful love rival.

273
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,690
What's that?

274
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:55,940
What's that?
N.. nothing, really.

275
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,530
N.. nothing, really.

276
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,750
Well, I'm in a hurry, so..

277
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,220
Wait, Yawara! Beware, and don't 
brush it off so easily!

278
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,330
C'mon, I'd better make it on time!

279
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,900
Shortcut, shortcut!

280
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,720
Oh damn!

281
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,940
That was nothing!

282
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,170
Go, Tomioka! Hang on! There!

283
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,870
End of match!

284
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,110
Final decision!

285
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,290
Tomioka had the advantage, right?

286
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:49,780
Yeah.

287
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:49,880
Yeah.
Of course, Tomioka was so persistent!

288
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,600
Of course, Tomioka was so persistent!

289
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,020
Todorikidai Kita High, Iwamoto-kun.

290
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,590
Advantage victory!

291
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,200
Tomioka, good job!

292
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,740
Yeah, nice guts!

293
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,140
B.. but..

294
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,550
Y.. yeah, you fought hard to the end. Don't cry.

295
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,870
We'll take it from here, right, Yasui?

296
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,470
Yasui? Yasui?

297
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,960
Yasui! Go for it!

298
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,300
Oh no, he's not listening!


299
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,860
He's shaking!

300
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,060
He's shaking!
Wh.. what?

301
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,130
Wh.. what?

302
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,940
It's 2-1. No turning back.

303
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:42,130
If I lose... If I lose, then Musashiyama
will lose, Yawara-san!

304
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,240
Ma'am, give me the ikataro and
the mamekichi-kun, please.

305
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,870
Well, I'd better hurry, before the match starts.

306
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,530
That back is...!

307
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,520
C.. could it be..?

308
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,520
I should've known. I didn't 
expect him to come here.

309
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,760
That runaway son of mine, Kojiro!

310
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,960
Here comes Inokuma Yawara!

311
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,100
Such thunderous cheering!

312
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,690
Despite many exciting concerts held here...

313
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,760
... it has been a while since this National Martial Arts hall filled with such excitement over a martial arts event, like its namesake.

314
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,450
Discovered by a newspaper scoop a year ago...

315
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,530
... Inokuma Yawara has displayed her formidable strength from 15 years of 
obscurity and intense training.

316
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,710
And, also a year ago, after defeating the 
tennis queen, Navratilova, Hon'ami Sayaka suddenly switched over to judo.




317
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,320
And she conquered the judo world like a lightning -- that's Hon'ami Sayaka!

318
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,680
Inokuma-san, as soon as I defeat you and settle everything, I'll retire from judo.



319
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,970
Be honored to be the final person that proves Hon'ami Sayaka's utter supremacy.

320
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,240
Everyone, hang in there. I'll be there soon.

321
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,280
I'd better make it on time!

322
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,830
Begin!

323
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:23,670
887 Days until the Barcelona Olympics



324
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,460
Finally the finals match!

325
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,930
The fight against Miss Sayaka!

326
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,130
Hanazono-kun, hang on!

327
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,060
Everyone, I'll be there soon!

328
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,210
Yawara, don't take her too easily. 
That Miss is really intense.

329
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,210
Hurry, I need to finish this match quickly!

330
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,350
Next time on "Yawara!" --

331
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,150
"The Decisive Battle! Yawara vs. Sayaka"

332
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,420
