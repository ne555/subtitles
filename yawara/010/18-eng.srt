rivals is just about to begin.

Th.. this piece of junk.. the brakes doesn't work!

16
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,470
Inokuma Yawara-san.

17
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,270
Once I defeat you and end this rivalry, 
I'll retire from judo.

18
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,690
I'll teach you in the finals that 
what's mine is mine.

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,000
Kazamatsuri-san.

20
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,440
Listen, Inokuma. You just concentrate 
on becoming Number 1 in Japan!

21
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,170
We will win, too.

22
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,170
We'll win!

23
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,780
Hanazono-kun... Everyone...

24
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,550
I won't allow any miserable fights.

25
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,790
Not for my beautiful perfection's sake.

26
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,210
Begin!

27
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,080
Phew, it's finally over.

28
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,810
Oh, now I need to go see
the Musashiyama team.

29
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,570
I.. Ippon! 
[Ippon -- Win, full 10 points]

30
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,700
Sayaka-san, your false tooth fell off.

31
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,770
Here.

32
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,290
N.. no.

33
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,420
That can't be!

34
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,900
I.. I.. I apologize.

35
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,710
I neglected to announce this 
instantaneous incident.

36
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,380
Perhaps all of you TV viewers are confused
as to what just happened.

37
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,600
Anyway, Inokuma Yawara won an 
ippon victory with an ippon zeoi, 
and has won the tournament.

38
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,260
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome!

39
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,800
You're awesome, Yawara-san!

40
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,570
I'm going to interview her first 
in the locker room!

41
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,770
Matsuda-san!

42
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,040
Yawara-san?

43
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,180
Yasui!

44
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,050
Don't let him take your collar!

45
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,760
Don't just stand there, Yasui!

46
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,630
Out of bounds! Halt!

47
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,380
Your chance is when the opponent
lays down his left foot.

48
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,680
It's okay.

49
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,350
You blew out 3 candles with the wind 
caused by your free foot. Yasui-kun!

50
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,720
Yawara-san.

51
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,160
I.. I can win, right?

52
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,590
Take you? To Setagaya's 12th Gym now?

53
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,460
Yes. Please take me.

54
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,710
We won't make it in time.

55
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,670
And your awards ceremony is about to start.

56
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,340
Take me!

57
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,560
Ippon! 
[Ippon -- Win, full 10 points]

58
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,620
Ya.. Yawara-san. I did it!

59
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,060
All right!

60
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,400
Hanazono-san.

61
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,390
D.. don't worry.

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,980
Just leave the rest.. leave the rest to me..!

63
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,160
Quit screaming! You're the 
one making me hurry!

64
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,780
I asked for you to hurry, but 
don't be so reckless!

65
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,450
We might go to heaven before we
reach Setagaya's 12th Gym!

66
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,520
There's a reason why I can't drive safely.

67
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,180
The ------ on this bike are broken!

68
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,080
What? What did you just say?

69
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,230
The brakes are broken!

70
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,120
Musashiyama High Captain, Hanazono-kun.



71
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,380
Hanazono-kun. Don't let the opponent 
know about your injured right leg.

72
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,600
That's right, Inokuma.

73
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,420
You're absolutely right.

74
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,360
Todorokidai Kita High Captain, Manjoume-kun.


75
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,860
Showing your weakness is the worst.

76
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,830
The opponent will mercilessly 
attack that weak spot.

77
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,830
Hanazono-san...

78
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,800
I hope he's okay...

79
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,900
What's wrong, eh? Sweating up a storm? 
Are you scared?

80
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,820
Don't kid me. What have you been looking at?

81
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,430
Inokuma Yawara threw me 
before "Begin" was called!

82
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,510
Inokuma Yawara threw me 
before "Begin" was called!
M.. Miss..

83
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,780
M.. Miss..

84
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,210
If not...

85
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,850
If not, I couldn't have been thrown so easily.

86
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,310
Right? That has to be it!

87
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,000
No. Inokuma Yawara threw you
right after the "Begin" call.

88
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,650
To prove that, look.

89
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,890
The timer stopped at 2 seconds, see?

90
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,880
You're telling me to believe that 
cheap, domestic clock?

91
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,970
Call the timekeepers over here right now.

92
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,320
Oh yeah, that timer's definitely wrong.

93
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,900
It's not two seconds after the 
start of the match, but...

94
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,290
...rather, one second, see?

95
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,680
Tokunaga!

96
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,340
Y.. yes?

97
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,250
Bring the car out. We're leaving immediately.

98
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,230
M.. Miss!

99
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,240
I can't hang around too long in such
a ridiculous tournament.

100
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,890
My, how ridiculous!

101
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,280
Miss..

102
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,490
Kazamatsuri-san, we'll practice 
as soon as we return home.

103
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,550
I can't just back away now.

104
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,460
B.. but, Sayaka-san. The awards ceremony...

105
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,590
..you're the runner-up... Sayaka-san...

106
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,500
Hon'ami Sayaka has given up the appeal.

107
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,700
It seems like she's accepted the final ruling.

108
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,270
But, Coach Yuutenji, wasn't Inokuma Yawara's ippon zeoi truly astonishing?

109
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,910
Yes, absolutely.

110
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,550
It was an absolute masterpiece of an awesome display of razor sharp skills!

111
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,720
Oh, the playback is on.



112
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,240
At the call of "Begin", Hon'ami 
Sayaka first moves in.

113
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,250
Inokuma Yawara is already in position 
for an ippon zeoi and..

114
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,440
...in one moment, she gets into 
Hon'ami's space, and..

115
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,110
...in the next moment... A.. amazing!

116
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,680
She threw, using just the timing and natural body flexion with no strength at all!

117
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,510
Utterly amazing.


118
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,150
This is the true image of judo 
that I have been striving for.

119
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,820
Not even close.

120
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,890
Inokuma Jigoro-sensei.

121
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,760
There, her left arm pull is still weak.

122
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,800
It'll be difficult for her to conquer the world, 
or even Japan, at just that level.

123
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,120
World? Is the ultimate 
objective the world then?

124
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,520
She'll get the Olympic gold medal, then 
the National Achievement Award!

125
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,730
Out of bounds!

126
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,700
Halt!

127
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,020
We're going to lose.

128
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,680
Hanazono-san, let's quit.

129
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,570
I see. His right leg is hurt.

130
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,970
Our judo club has gotten stronger
with Inokuma's coaching.

131
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:28,020
I can't let this injury make us... make us... lose!


132
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,100
Wait for me Hanazono-kun! Everyone!

133
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,930
I'll be there soon!

134
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,480
What?

135
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,650
Inokuma Yawara and Hon'ami 
Sayaka are gone?

136
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,680
With no champ and runner-up, how are we gonna do the awards ceremony?

137
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,570
Just find them!

138
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,880
Matsuda-san, where'd you go?

139
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,000
Hey, aren't we there yet?

140
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,850
Quit complaining!


141
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,170
Tokunaga, hurry up and start the car.

142
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,880
Y.. yes.

143
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,150
You're Hon'ami Sayaka, right?

144
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,520
See, the reporters are already 
here because you're so slow.

145
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,160
I saw the match.

146
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,010
You will become even stronger.

147
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,830
Of course I will.

148
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,780
Tokunaga, hurry up and start the car.

149
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,260
But my daughter will get even stronger, too.

150
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,790
Daughter?!

151
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,080
We're here!

152
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,320
Now let's see if this bike's brakes work...

153
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,000
A.. awesome!

154
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,130
Dammit, he keeps going for my right leg!

155
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,620
Hanazono-kun. Hanazono-kun. Hanazono-kun!

156
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,690
I'm sorry, Inokuma.

157
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm can't do it anymore.

158
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,630
I.. I'm starting to hear things.

159
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,470
Yuko!

Hanazono-kun!

162
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,720
I'm s.. sorry, Inokuma. I'm at my limit.

163
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,970
My right leg isn't listening to me anymore..

164
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,880
Hanazono-kun! Hanazono-kun!

165
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,600
Ohh, I can hear your voice in my head..

166
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,900
Hanazono-kun!

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,840
But, I'm a wimp that gives up easily.

168
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,050
I.. I'm 100 years too early and unworthy 
to fall in love with you.

169
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,590
Hang in there, Hanazono-kun!

170
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,890
Sorry. Forgive me, Inokuma!

171
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,130

Yawara-san!

175
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,850
Hanazono-kun, grab the back of
his collar with your left hand!

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,490
And then, hook your left leg into it!

177
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,110
Hurry! Hurry, or he's gonna 
score an ippon on you!

178
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,740
Oh..!

179
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,470
Hurry! Take his back collar!

180
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,010
G.. gotcha!

181
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,540
Clamp your legs around his left arm, cradle 
his other arm with your right arm...

182
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,040
...and then tighten his collar with your left arm!

183
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,010

[Jigoku Zeme -- Hell Attack]


185
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,900
We will now begin the First Oshiuri TV Cup Women's Judo Tournament Awards Ceremony.

186
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,580
Third place, Tohdoh Yuki, 4th degree.

187
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,480
Runner-up, Hon'ami Sayaka, 1st degree.

188
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,550
Err, due to unforeseen circumstances, 
1st degree Hon'ami cannot make this ceremony. Please bear with us.

189
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,080
And finally, the champion,
Inokuma Yawara, 1st degree.

190
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,910
Err, also due to unforeseen circumstances,
1st degree Inokuma cannot make
this ceremony either.

191
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,800
As her representative, Inokuma Jigoro, 7th degree, a close kin, will substitute her.

192
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm 8th degree, Jya!



193
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,010
But my daughter will get even stronger, too.

194
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,350
Miss, I found out.

195
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,160
And, what did you find?

196
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,360
Oh, yes.

197
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:39,120
Inokuma Yawara's father, Inokuma 
Kojiro, is also a judo expert.

198
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:50,840
According to the records, in 1974, he appeared like a comet and won the Judo Nationals.

199
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:50,850
According to the records, in 1974, he appeared like a comet and won the Judo Nationals.
W.. won?

200
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,270
W.. won?

201
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,520
It's like what Yawara-san just did!

202
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,440
But, within the year of debut,
he disappeared from all records.

203
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,970
Wh.. why?

204
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,730
He ran away.

205
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,600
Ran away? Why?

206
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:22,780
I see. Being Inokuma-sensei's son and Inokuma Yawara's dad makes him a judo expert.

207
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,850
Inokuma Kojiro.

208
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,320
He knows every detail of the Inokuma's judo.

209
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,340
Tokunaga.

210
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,390
Tokunaga.
Yes?

211
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,740
Yes?

212
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,380
Find this Inokuma Kojiro immediately. 
No budget limits, either.

213
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,880
Utilize the Hon'ami family's vast wealth and information network to find him.

214
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:39,900
Utilize the Hon'ami family's vast wealth and information network to find him.
Yes, Miss.

215
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,590
Yes, Miss.

216
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:47,480
And.. and, we'll completely analyze
Inokuma Yawara's judo secrets.

217
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,660
His leg.. his right leg is loosening!

218
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,530
Hanazono-kun!

219
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,190
That's it. Don't loosen the grip!

220
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,030
You've gotta score soon or 
you'll run out of time!

221
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,490
I won't let go, even if I die.

222
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,640
Inokuma, for you, I'll... win!

223
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,460
Inokuma-san, Yawara-san is 
invincible, isn't she?

224
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Of course.

225
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,660
But, her skills aren't sharp enough yet.

226
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,530
She's still a diamond in the rough.


227
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,370
She seems so strong, yet you're saying 
that she can be stronger?

228
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,690
Without shedding more tears and 
sweat to sharpen her skills...

229
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,110
...there's no way she can aim for the world!

230
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,280
Whoa!

231
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,630
No! Don't let go!

232
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,300
You'll win with just a little more!

233
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,920
Put more pressure in your legs!

234
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,030
Keep going, Hanazono-san!

235
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,000
He got it!

236
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,150
End of match!

237
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,020

240
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,890
I'm.. here, Hanazono-kun.

241
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,400
Did you win your tournament at the 
National Martial Arts Hall?

242
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,300
Yes.

243
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,150
I.. won.

244
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,330
Really? You're so great, Inokuma.

245
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,280
You're really great.

246
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,890
No, all of you are great.

247
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,930
We all won for the first time. Us!

248
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,900
It's because you taught us judo, Yawara-san.

249
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,810
No, all of you taught me instead.

250
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,450
Doing your best is.. great, isn't it?

251
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,210
Ya.. Yawara-san!

252
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,150
The... the Camera...

253
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,810
Oh, hey.. wait... umm..

254
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:35,330
The next day, all of the sports newspapers 
put the photo of Yawara-san's victory at the National Martial Arts Hall on the front page.

But, our Daily Every Sports splashed its front page with a close-up of Yawara-san's tears of joy from seeing her first judo victory.

That's my Yawara.

265
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,720
She easily became Japan's Number One.

266
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,400
But, this is all because of my 
excellence in coaching her.

267
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,230
And so, because of an overwhelming amount of requests, we've decided to share the 
stories of my youth to everyone...
