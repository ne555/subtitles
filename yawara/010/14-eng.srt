At the official press conference, your entry 
into the tournament was confirmed.

11
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,430
At the official press conference, your entry 
into the tournament was confirmed.
Tournament?

12
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,000
Tournament?

National Martial Arts Hall?

17
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,130
The Oshiuri TV Cup!

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,020
What?

19
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,370
Fight, fight!

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,030
50 more meters!

21
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,590
Who do you think that fashionable
miss is doing that for?

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,520
Yawara-san, it's to fight you!

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,340
Sayaka-san!

24
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,870
Kazamatsuri-san..

25
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,960
Wha..?

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,160
Episode 14
Yawara's Date Has So Much Surveillance!

27
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,110
Can you hear me?

28
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,960
Right now, Yawara-san is at the Kichi-jyoji's Sun Road Cafe with her classmates.

29
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,650
I'll leave the rest.. to you!

30
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,370
Yawara, you're gonna get fat.

31
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,960
Something happened, didn't it?

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,000
Something happened, didn't it?
Like, getting dumped or something..?

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,320
Like, getting dumped or something..?

34
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,360
Thought so.

35
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,160
Was it perhaps Kazamatsuri-san?

36
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,450
That's sad.

37
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,280
I see.. you were dumped by 
Kazamatsuri-san, huh?

38
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,400
Hey, Kyoko, you seem happy.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,430
Hey, Kyoko, you seem happy.
Are you interested in him?

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,360
Are you interested in him?

41
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,540
O... of course not. No, no, no, no!

42
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,290
That's a shock. Kazamatsuri-san 
was such a wonderful man.

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,440
B... but, you'll meet a more 
wonderful person, Yawara.

44
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,070
Really? You don't meet such a great 
person like that too often...

45
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,650
Wha.. geez!

46
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,920
But, you can't argue with genetics.

47
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,250
What do you mean by that?

48
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,930
We ate dinner at Yawara's house
a while back, right?

49
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,970
Well, she's eating exactly like the 
way her grandfather ate.

50
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,100
Oh, that's true.

51
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,670
Y... Yawara, come on, cheer up!

52
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,610
I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to insult you!

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,140
Yawara..

54
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,680
Okay, next is Tokoro-ten!

55
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,740
You're gonna eat some more?

56
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,450
You're really gonna get fat.

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,010
But you do seem a little happier.

58
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,900
Eating made me happier. It's true 
that "nothing beats appetite."

59
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,830
You guys are not going anywhere
until I'm finished.

60
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,960
What?

61
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,910
Come to think of it, it's not worth worrying 
over a person or two like Kazamatsuri-san.

62
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,080
She's acting tough.

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,710
So it's reckless bingeing.

64
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,400
They say that lonely women get fat, right?

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,860
I was the only one thinking 
it was a relationship.

66
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,580
From the beginning, Kazamatsuri-san must have only thought of Sayaka-san...

67
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,670
Ahh! Yawara! Red! The light's red! Red!

68
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,310
K.. Ka.. Ka..

69
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,370
Kazamatsuri-san!

70
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,960
I've been looking for you, Yawara-san!


71
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,330
W... well, we'll go on home, okay, Yawara?

72
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,210
Kazamatsuri-san, good afternoon!

73
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,360
Hey now, let's go!

74
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,100
You needed to talk to me?

75
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,270
I just wanted to see you, Yawara-san.

76
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,400
Oh? Isn't there someone else you 
want to see, instead of me?

77
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh geez, you're not your usual self, Yawara-san! Hahahaha!

78
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,650
You don't have time to laugh! Stop small talking and get to the core of the plan!


79
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,050
I didn't ask for you to go on a date with her!

80
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,930
I just asked you to urge Yawara-san
to be in the tournament!

81
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,970
Quit grinning like that! Hey, 
don't get so close to her!

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,540
Why am I so irritated?

83
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,330
Oww! What was that for?

84
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,140
Sniffing around again? You hyena guy!

85
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,870
Inokuma-san. Why are you here?

86
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,940
I'm here to take my practice-skipping, delinquent girl home.

87
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,020
N... no, you can't go there!

88
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,870
Let me go, you..!

89
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,270
With an important tournament coming
up, she doesn't have time to fool 
around with that glitzy guy.

90
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,080
They're at a critical point for 
that important tournament.

91
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,560
What's that?

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,650
I'm having that guy urge her 
to be in the tournament.

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,190
I don't need his help! I'll just drag 
her into the tournament.

94
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
No, you can't do that!

95
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,700
Kazamatsuri-san, you..!

96
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,520
I thought it was strange for
you to cancel practice.

97
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,620
I just knew you went to see 
that Inokuma Yawara!

98
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,900
You were wonderful in that match the other day.

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,840
You threw that massive giant, 
Tohdoh Yuki, with an ippon zeoi.
ippon zeoi -- one arm shoulder throw

100
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,560
That has to be none other than a fine art!

101
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,330
You took a martial art like judo and 
took it to the height of fine art.

102
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,530
Umm..

103
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,080
Won't you show me once more.. 
your ippon zeoi? Please?

104
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,240
That jerk!

105
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,730
Take it easy. Relax!

106
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,490
Why don't you have Sayaka-san show it to you?

107
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,660
Sayaka-san does judo more seriously than me...

108
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,870
She's more beautiful than me, 
has a better figure, and...

109
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:38,530
Don't think like that. She doesn't 
even come close to your beauty.

110
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,230
That's why she used her money 
to hire me as her coach.

111
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,470
Gosh, that's not like you, Yawara-san. 
I'm coaching for the sake of business.

112
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,080
If you didn't have Jigoro-sensei as your coach, I would have definitely chosen to coach you.

113
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,780
You seem down. We should 
go to a different place.

114
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,680
Come on, let's go.

115
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,120
H... hey, those two are leaving!


116
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,580
All righty then, I'll conk his head with this!

117
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,790
Leave that piece of junk here!

118
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,870
Make sure they don't know that 
they're being followed, okay?

119
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,660
Hmph! Why do I need to be sneaky, too?

120
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,070
Yawara! Go home and practice!

121
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,870
Yawara!

122
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,430
Practice!

123
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,680
Stop it! Every time you do that, Yawara-san refuses to be in matches!

124
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,400
Shut up! That guy is Hon'ami Sayaka's coach!



125
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,390
U... uhh, excuse us!

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,300
Y... you're..

127
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,640
Hon'ami Sayaka!

128
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,810
I... I just came to do some shopping.

129
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,600
Hey, wait!

130
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,410
It's your fault, Daily Every!

131
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,320
Inokuma-san! Had you stayed quiet,
it wouldn't have turned out this way!

132
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,120
This is a godsend!

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,750
I don't have any coins!

134
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,370
Sayaka-san.. you?

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,230
Excuse me, you're in the way 
so please be seated.

136
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,230
Hmph! I can't sit in such a dirty seat!

137
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,700
Grandpa, if you'd like, have my seat.

138
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,310
I am NOT frail enough to 
need to be offered a seat!

139
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,440
This is like a tortoise and a hare.

140
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,260
Can't you go faster? Didn't we tip 
you more than enough?

141
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,980
Huh? Who told you to stop!

142
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,660
It's a bus stop.

143
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,430
My, that's a pain!

144
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,080
Well then, I'll just rent this bus.

145
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,300
Okay, no more complaints, right? Let me drive!

146
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, hey!

147
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,010
You're being reckless, Inokuma-san!

148
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,660
First of all, do you have a license?

149
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,580
I'm 8th degree black belt in judo!

150
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,330
Left! Go left!

151
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,770
Gotcha.

152
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,790
Where do you think you're going?

153
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,070
It's a bus-jack! Help!

154
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,420
It's a red light!

155
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,460
Ta.. take off, Jya!

156
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,250
When people see the ocean, for 
some reason, they feel peaceful.

157
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,300
Do you know why Yawara-san?

158
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,090
In French, the word "ocean" is feminine.. 
as in "motherly ocean."

159
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,570
But, the ocean isn't just beauty.

160
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,730
It has the immeasurable ability to carve the continents and to change the shape of the world.

161
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,820
Just like you.

162
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,900
Kazamatsuri-san.

163
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,900
Have you ever thought of this, Yawara-san..

164
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,550
Your judo conquers the world, and the 
world cheers you on with praise.


165
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:14,250
Yawara-san, I can clearly hear the large crowds joyfully cheering you on.

166
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,270
I never thought of something so grand.

167
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,700
You have no ambition. You can do it, you know. You need to live life more boldly.

168
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,700
I have a more.. local problem.

169
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,800
Geez, how much longer do
I need to sneak around?


170
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,690
Shh! Be quiet.

171
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,000
And what is this local problem, Yawara-san?

172
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,280
For example..

173
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,200
For example?

174
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,590
For example, I like this person, 
but this person likes someone else.

175
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,100
And is always with this certain woman.

176
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,110
Nope. I think that's just your misunderstanding.

177
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,670
That person must be with this certain 
woman for business purposes only.

178
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,080
Eii! What are they doing?

179
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,540
Eii! What are they doing?
Just a little more!

180
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,120
Just a little more!

181
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,230
Just a little more!
I cannot stand to watch this any longer!

182
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,990
I cannot stand to watch this any longer!

183
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,180
Man, you too?! Darnit, I can't 
stand to watch this either!

184
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,450
Yawara-san, you will be in the 
next tournament, right?

185
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,680
What are they...!

186
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,700
Stop it, you delinquent girl!

187
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,820
That jerk!

188
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,360
I cannot forgive them!

189
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,890
How bad does she intend to be?

190
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,560
Please let me think it over.

191
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,550
Yawara-san! You shine most 
brilliantly when you do judo!

192
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,870
When I do judo, I..?

193
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,380
Who asked you to do THAT?

194
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,580
C... calm down now. What did I do?

195
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,130
Just because Yawara-san has feelings for you..

196
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,990
I just did what you asked for, which was 
to urge her to be in the tournament.

197
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,800
I... Inokuma-sensei!

198
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,160
How dare you fool around with my granddaughter, you playboy!

199
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,820
No, you misunderstand!

200
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,580
I never, r... really..

201
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,270
Kazamatsuri-san.

202
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,980
Sayaka-san.

203
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,760
You, of all people.. YOU, of all people..!

204
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,510
Sayaka-san!



205
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,370
You made the situation more complicated!

206
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,030
You reap what you sow.

207
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,800
What?

208
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,990
Both of you.. don't you ever get near Yawara.

209
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,780
If something like this ever happens 
again, I'll attend to you!

210
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,320
You'll be in the next tournament, right?

211
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,600
You shine most brilliantly when you do judo!

212
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,030
Ah, Yawara-san!

213
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,990
Everyone in the judo club..

214
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
Yawara-san, umm..

215
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,630
Why aren't you coaching us?

216
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,950
Even I have other things that keep me busy.

217
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,860
Yeah! You were probably dating some guy anyway! Despite having a man like me...

218
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:01,100
E... even he's frustrated.. since the summer tournament preliminaries are coming up.



219
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,770
But, Hanazono-san can't participate 
because of his leg fracture..

220
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,140
And without your guidance, our team will surely lose in the first round again.

221
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,460
I was just forced into coaching by everyone.


222
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,480
I never agreed to be the coach.

223
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,380
Th... that's true.

224
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,780
And, you do have your own tournament
to prepare for, right?

225
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,270
Those guys! I told them not to 
pressure Inokuma, but..!

226
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,260
I'm sorry. Well, goodbye.

227
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,670
Yawara-chan!

228
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,500
Please! Share just a piece of your strength!

229
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,340
Sudoh..

230
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,210
To tell you the truth, I don't care
about the judo club.

231
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,880
However, these upperclassmen 
guys are just so pathetic!

232
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,160
I know that to you, Yawara-chan, 
this is all a pain.

233
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,990
That's why we're begging you!

234
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,880
At least for once, I wanna.. I wanna..

235
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,980
Shine brilliantly!

236
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,820
S... S... Sudoh!

237
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,960
Hey, you guys, stop standing
there and beg, too!

238
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,330
Please!

239
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,290
Don't do such an embarrassing 
thing in front of my house!

240
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,400
Please go home!

241
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,590
Yawara-san! Please!

242
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,260
Yawara-san! Please!
Everyone.. and their selfish agendas!

243
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,930
Everyone.. and their selfish agendas!

244
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,630
I'm home.

245
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,970
Oh, Yawara.

246
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,220
Mom, I need some advice..

247
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,450
Great news! I got a new lead about 
your father's whereabouts!

248
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,580
Really? Where?

249
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,930
At Shikoku, a person doing the hachi-jyu-hachi kasho meguri saw someone!
hachi-jyu-hachi kasho meguri --pilgrimage to the 88 holy spots.

250
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,070
A man in a judo outfit!

251
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,440
Really?

252
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,670
It has to be your father!

253
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:07,220
I'm leaving for a while again, but, 
Yawara, you'll be okay, right?

254
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,440
S... sure.

255
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,040
Oh, what about my advice?

256
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,300
No. Nothing.

257
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,530
Well, I'm going. And, I already made dinner.

258
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,030
Mom..

259
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,670
Is this family split up because of judo?

260
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,660
It's because of judo that this household
is torn apart, isn't it?

261
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,920
Oh my, what are you saying, Yawara?

262
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,960
Because!

263
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,350
Yawara, it's totally the opposite.

264
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,810
Had it not been for judo, your father 
and I would never have met.

265
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:58,270
He was so wonderful! Your father shone 
most brilliantly when he did judo!

266
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,470
Shone.. most brilliantly?

267
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,670
Uh-huh. That's why I'm still out looking for him.

268
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,650
Oops, am I lusting?

269
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,570
Oh, it's already this late! Well then. 
Take care of Grandfather, okay?

270
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,930
I'll call as soon as I find your father.

271
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,990
Mom...

272
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,700
Oh!

273
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,230
Are you Yawara's friends?

274
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,890
Yes, but I'd like to be more than just friends...

275
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,400
H... h...hey!

276
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,620
Yawara! Your friends are 
waiting for you out here!

277
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,400
Well, I do need to go, so...

278
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,190
Yes, please excuse us!

279
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,830
Your father shone most brilliantly
when he did judo.

280
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,130
Had it not been for judo, your father 
and I never would have met.

281
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,860
You shine most brilliantly when you do judo!

282
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,540
You will be in the next tournament, right?

283
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,520
Kazamatsuri Coach. Because you 
tried to do that to Yawara-san...

284
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,780
... it's such a traffic jam, plus it's raining cats and dogs, and on top of that, we got a flat tire.

285
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,330
Don't blame me for everything! 
I just did what you asked me to...

286
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,140
I didn't ask you to KISS Yawara-san!

287
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,190
Inokuma-san! It might help if you came 
out to give us a hand, you know.

288
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,910
It's poison for senior citizens 
like me to get wet from the rain.

289
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,160
At least for once.. I wanna.. shine brilliantly!

290
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,010
What? No way!

291
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,100
You're all crazy. Here's some towels!
Use this umbrella, too!

292
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,800
Inokuma!

293
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,840
For God's sake..!

294
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,640
Yawara-san!

295
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,410
Oh, Yawara-san! Yawara-san! 
Please, Yawara-san!

296
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,830
Tomorrow.. let's meet at the 
school dojo at 6am, okay?

297
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,500
I... Inokuma!

298
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,160
All right!

299
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,210
Tamao-san, could you get me a towel, please?

300
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,740
Because of that stupid girl, I'm all drenched!

301
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,040
Th... this is..?

302
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,510
Finally.. she's finally willing to do it, eh?

303
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:23,470
908 Days to the Barcelona Olympics

304
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,680
You're finally willing to do it, Yawara!


305
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,850
I'm shining brilliantly? Me?

306
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,630
I shine most brilliantly when I do judo?

307
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,790
Finally, the duel between you and 
Miss Sayaka will happen, Yawara!

308
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,630
Is it true, Kazamatsuri-san?

309
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Oh yeah, you need a black belt!

310
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,560
It's not cool to have on a
white belt, right Yawara?

311
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,150
I want to know.. I really want to find out!

312
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,620
Next time, on "Yawara!"...

313
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,870
A Challenge to Yawara Over Love!

314
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,580
