1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,800
From my lips a melody pierces
through the sunset one day.

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
And as I scanned the town below,
it was you that I clearly saw.

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,550
That piece of really burning dream. 
Please don't just throw it away!

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
So just one more time, won't you please
rekindle your heart's desire.

5
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,350
Mixed with the wave of people at the crossroads, with who, where and what are you doing now?

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,500
Just like the fun of finding a diamond
buried within a pile of sand!

7
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,850
Wonders are always reserved inside your heart.

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,350
The wish in your eyes will
become true some day.

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,770
My dearly beloved Kaneko.

10
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:53,060
Ever since you passed away 15 years ago, 
our runaway son, Kojiro, is still missing, 
but Yawara is doing great.

11
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,600
Under my personal care, the day that she'll 
get the gold medal at the Olympics...

12
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,150
... and the National Achievement Award 
won't be too far down the road.

13
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,620
I'm home!

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,740
Grandpa?

15
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,670
I'm home!

16
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,410
Grandpa --

17
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,690
Eii, you're late! You're late, Yawara!

18
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,990
Today is the 15th anniversary of Kaneko's death, so with who, where, and what were you doing?

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,030
Well, I went to buy the cherry 
rice cakes that you asked for.

20
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,200
It was Grandma's favorite, right?

21
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,810
Here's the cherry rice cakes.

22
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,560
Oh, that's right!

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,590
Tea! Get some tea, Yawara!

24
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,370
Kaneko loved to eat these while 
sipping coarse tea.

25
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,920
You're beginning to look like Kaneko 
more and more, Yawara.

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,390
No way? Like Grandma?

27
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,370
When I met Kaneko, she was as 
beautiful as any heavenly being.

28
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,690
And I was a brash young lad, ready 
to move up in the ranks.

29
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:58,910
We had met during the rough times 
revolving around the 2.26 incident.

30
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:58,960
We had met during the rough times 
revolving around the 2.26 incident.
G.. Grandpa, I know.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,690
G.. Grandpa, I know.

32
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,590
I've heard that story so many times..

33
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:03,790
I've heard that story so many times..
During those times, there was pure love.

34
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,390
During those times, there was pure love.

35
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,420
And pure vegetables, and rice.

36
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,250
Grandpa...

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,390
Those were the times.

38
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,450
But, it sure brings back memories.

39
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Episode 19
Jigoro, His Love and 
Youth's Raging Storms

40
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,000
Showa 9 Nen [1934]

41
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,000
So this is Tokyo? Is this it?

42
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,310
The ground here is so hard. You can't 
have a farm on these hard grounds.

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
Oh my gosh, what's that?

44
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,970
Oh gosh, it's a country boy. A country boy.

45
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,730
No, don't look at him.

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,650
Hey you, what are you doing?

47
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,870
Oh man, geez, I can't think of anything.

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,160
Am I at the peak of my talents?

49
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,540
Is my dream of becoming 
a novelist just a fantasy?

50
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,180
H.. how dare you!

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,020
Wh.. what's up?

52
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,040
Wh.. what's up?
He's going up against a cop!

53
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,890
He's going up against a cop!

54
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,120
What? No way!

55
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,100
Why, I don't need charity from a g.. guy like you!

56
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,390
Don't say that and just eat it.

57
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,450
It's the authentic Shonai rice from Yamagata.

58
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,620
It's delicious.

59
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,230
I.. I'm telling you not to eat your lunch 
here, don't you understand!?

60
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,020
Then, what about some kimpira gobou? 
[kimpira gobou - shredded burdock]

61
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,310
Come here, you're under arrest!

62
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,090
How dare you waste food!

63
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,460
What? You're resisting arrest?

64
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,090
Amazing!

65
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,820
I won't forgive people who waste food.

66
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,160
I, Inokuma Jigoro --

67
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,600
Let go! I'm still eating my lunch!

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,710
You don't have time for that.


69
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,800
There'll be more after you because 
you just threw a cop.

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,040
This is delicious!

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,380
Th.. that's great. The steak bowl 
here is one of the best.

72
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,010
And your throw was one of the best, too.

73
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,450
You said you were Inokuma Jigoro, right?

74
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,460
I'm a novelist-to-be, and I had a writer's block, but I was refreshed by your throw!

75
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,500
You're a novelist?

76
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,590
Some day, soon.

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,780
To draw a moving novel, 
and be a famous novelist.

78
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,790
Then why don't you use me as 
a model for your next story?

79
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,400
I came to Tokyo today from Yamagata.

80
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,950
To become Japan's greatest judo athlete.

81
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,110
Put all my daily struggles and glorious moments I achieve until I reach the
ultimate goal together into a book.

82
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,660
It'll surely sell.

83
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,420
Wow, you're so sure of yourself.


84
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,780
What's your judo record like?

85
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,160
230 victories in a row.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,910
W.. well I'll be..

87
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,780
And my opponent was a KUMA.
[KUMA -- bear]

88
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,920
I threw a total of 230 KUMA. 
[KUMA -- bears]

89
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,430
KUMA? The comedian, KUMA-san?

90
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:14,610
KUMA? The comedian, KUMA-san?
Groowwl!

91
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,180
Groowwl!

92
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,400
Kind of bear!

93
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,680
A r.. real bear?

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,930
A.. an eat and run thief!

95
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,150
Hey, wait up!

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,180
Wait! Wait up, you!

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,330
Wait!

98
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm sorry!

99
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,660
A man.. that steals food! How pathetic!

100
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,300
Way to go, Jigoro-kun! Great job!


101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,850
Th.. thank you very much.

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,410
How can I repay you?

103
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,120
Don't worry about it.

104
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,490
I just can't stand people who 
are twisted in their ways.

105
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,110
U.. umm, you haven't paid your bill yet.

106
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,060
U.. uhh...

107
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,160
Thanks for treating me, Mr. Novelist.

108
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,000
H.. hey, I'm a poor writer.
I don't have any money.

109
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,190
Weren't you going to pay for me?

110
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,820
I'm penniless.

111
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,280
Eii, don't urban people have any compassion?

112
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,030
I nabbed a thief for them, 
so why do I have to do this?

113
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,130
They sure used us like slaves.

114
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,690
It's a lot easier throwing bears.

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,520
I don't know how legitimate he is, 
but he has a strange charm.

116
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,730
For a change, I'm getting 
the urge to write again!

117
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,540
Hey, Mr. Novelist, thanks for guiding me.

118
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,230
This must be the dojo I've been looking for.

119
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:43,950
You came all the way from Yamagata 
to learn at this run-down dojo?

120
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,250
You came all the way from Yamagata 
to learn at this run-down dojo?
Kyudou-kan Dojo

121
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,850
Kyudou-kan Dojo

122
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,500
It may look run-down, but it's beautiful in spirit.

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,940
The master of this dojo is none other than the master I adore, Ushio Umanosuke-sensei.

124
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,490
Patience

125
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,470
Patience
D.. died?

126
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:57,980
Patience

127
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Patience
Y.. yes.

128
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,290
Patience

129
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,250
Patience
Even the invincible master, Ushio-sensei, couldn't defeat an illness.

130
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:02,790
Patience

131
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,910
Patience
Now there's only two students left.

132
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,000
Patience

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,890
Patience
And this is the state of this dojo...

134
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:06,920
Patience

135
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,860
Ushio-sensei p.. passed away?!

136
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,180
The Ushio-sensei that I adored and idolized ever since my childhood..

137
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:25,130
Sensei's only daughter, Miss Kaneko, 
has been running around trying to 
re-establish this dojo, but in vain..

138
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,170
J.. Jigoro-kun.

139
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,630
Ah, Miss.

140
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,560
Oh? A visitor?

141
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,420
I am Kaneko.

142
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,350
I.. Ino.. ku.. J.. Ji..

143
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,120
This apricot-like and baker's garlic-like bittersweet feeling...

144
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,170
..I'm in love!

145
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,700
If this isn't love, then what is love?

146
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,420
We're just dropping by again, Miss.

147
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,200
I.. it's the guys from the 
Goudou-kan Dojo again.

148
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,100
Our important sign... H.. how could you?

149
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,020
You won't need it anymore, since this
place'll be torn down soon.

150
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:31,260
Now Miss, we need you to move out. 
The due date for the debt is long overdue.

151
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,280
Or, have you thought about 
our president's offer?

152
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,240
A beautiful lady like you doesn't need to
stay couped up in this dusty place.

153
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,690
Don't you touch Miss Kaneko!

154
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,320
Who the hell are you?

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,390
Who the hell are you?
I am Inokuma Jigoro, jya!

156
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,260
I am Inokuma Jigoro, jya!

157
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,620
Eii, a thug like you deserves to be 
thrown by me to the pits of hell!

158
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:54,780
Eii, a thug like you deserves to be 
thrown by me to the pits of hell!
Q.. quit it!

159
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,810
Q.. quit it!

160
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,150
You're outnumbered!

161
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,070
Let go!

162
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,890
If I win, then your novel will 
become more interesting.

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,140
I.. If you lose now, then it won't even be 
long enough to be a short story!

164
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,550
What are you all blabbing about?

165
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:09,650
What are you all blabbing about?
I'll rip you apart.

166
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,300
I'll rip you apart.

167
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,310
I'll rip you apart.
Stop it, everyone.

168
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,250
Stop it, everyone.

169
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,570
President!

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,920
Sa.. Saimonji-san.

171
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,820
I'm sorry, Kaneko-san.

172
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,700
My men don't know how to treat 
a proper lady with manners.

173
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,790
Is he Japanese?

174
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,750
Y.. yeah.

175
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,300
By the way, I'm came to get
a reply for my PROPOSAL.

176
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,990
What's a FURO-BOUZU? 
[FURO-BOUZU -- bathing bald guy]

177
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,600
PROPOSAL. A request for a hand in marriage.

178
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,340
Wh.. what?!

179
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,450
I thought that I had given 
you an answer already.

180
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,350
Kaneko-san, you're so untouchable.

181
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,880
I know that the first few no's mean yes, anyway.

182
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,530
Besides, if you agree, this proof 
of debt will be nullified.

183
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,930
You can continue this dojo, not only that,
you'll get all the money you want.

184
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,100
To make this dojo as big as you want.

185
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,000
You're always so beautiful.

186
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,820
Your existence itself is like a SHI.
[SHI -- poetry]

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
JI? You call her a JI? 
[JI -- hemorrhoids]

188
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,990
What a rude thing to say!

189
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,120
W.. who are you?

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,570
I mean SHI... as in poetry, or POESIE.

191
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,440
POE-JI? There's no such JI! 
[JI -- word]

192
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,390
That's why I hate country boys.

193
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,920
I'll come again, Kaneko-san.

194
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,160
I look forward to a good reply next time.

195
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,860
H.. hey, wait up, you! Wait up, you rude jerk!

196
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,470
That Miss sure is stubborn.

197
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,600
Ah, she'll fall soon. Just like 
a ripe fruit falls from a tree.


198
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,420
But that guy...

199
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,620
..he's in the way.

200
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,120
Th.. then it's a scam!

201
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,560
Yes.

202
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,380
The money we borrowed during my 
father's illness gradually increased 
by two fold, and three-fold.

203
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,230
Saimonji hired men from the Goudou-kan 
dojo to help with the eviction.

204
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,770
And, to stop this harassment, 
he asked me to marry him.

205
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,180
That's unforgivable!

206
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,800
That Saimonji!

207
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,000
Miss Kaneko, leave it to me.

208
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,130
I'll protect you with my power and revive 
this Kyudou-kan Dojo once again.

209
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,890
I'm beat.

210
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,800
Eii, straighten up!

211
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,450
That's why you get picked on by
those Goudou-kan Dojo jerks.

212
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,320
Stand up! Stand up!

213
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,990
We're going to do uchi-komi 10,000 times!
[uchi-komi -- repeat throw practice]

214
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,780
10,000 times?

215
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,310
H.. help!

216
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,510
Hey wait! Wait!

217
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,670
Sigh.

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,380
Instead of reviving the dojo, 
you lost your last 2 students.

219
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,970
It's better that they're not here, anyway.

220
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,240
Umm.

221
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,700
Please, the breakfast is ready.

222
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,680
This is delicious!

223
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,050
You're a great cook, Miss Kaneko.

224
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,530
Right?

225
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,360
Y.. yeah.

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,410
Seconds, please.

227
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,720
Oh, yes.

228
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,450
A boiled egg-like warmth from her hands.

229
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,310
It's love... definitely love. A burning love!

230
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,860
Umm, Jigoro-san.

231
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,220
Please promise me one thing.

232
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,010
H.. huh?

233
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,160
Even if the Goudou-kan Dojo men come, 
please don't fight them.

234
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,650
I don't want to use judo for such fights.

235
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,170
My father's... judo was a very pure one.

236
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,170
O.. of course!

237
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,540
I'm not so small as to care about those guys!

238
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,780
I, Inokuma Jigoro, going up against a 570 bears, have purified my body and soul! Yes!

239
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,030
Didn't you say 230 bears?



240
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,830
I was modest with my figures then.

241
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,180
The best! Miss Kaneko is the best!

242
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,790
You guys...!

243
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,110
Shove off.

244
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,960
Wh.. what do you want?

245
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,430
Well, since we heard you're the only one left...

246
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,080
We decided to be your practice buddies.



247
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,260
As a samurai's generosity.

248
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,320
As a samurai's generosity.
Don't play with me!

249
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
Don't play with me!

250
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,060
I'm serious. Now, let's practice.

251
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,050
Please promise me.. not to fight them.

252
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,540
What the heck. Let's take him all at once!

253
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,670
J.. Jigoro-kun, wake up! Jigoro-kun!

254
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,720
Jigoro-san.

255
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,100
The Goudou-kan guys did it.

256
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,660
Jigoro-san!

257
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,900
I.. I'm alright.

258
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm the g.. guy that fought 890 bears...

259
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,230
J.. Jigoro-kun!

260
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,650
Jigoro-san!

261
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,410
I'm sorry, Jigoro-san.

262
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,940
All this, for me...

263
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,870
Saimonji-san.

264
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,440
I heard, Kaneko-san, about that 
country boy getting roughed up.

265
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,810
The Goudou-kan guys have good hearts,
but are out of my control.

266
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,290
By the way, did you rethink
your reply to my offer?

267
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,730
Oh yes, I saw a strange dream.

268
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,090
The Kyudou-kan Dojo got torn down, 
and that country boy gets hurt more.

269
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,770
Oh, I wish it doesn't become true at all.

270
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,700
Wh.. what, you're m.. marrying Saimonji?!

271
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,590
N.. No way! No! No! Don't get under his thumb!

272
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,230
Yeah, Kaneko-san. You've got 
to think of yourself more.

273
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,710
No.

274
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,980
I can't trouble all of you anymore.

275
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,970
You're not troubling me at all.

276
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,780
And, I don't want to lose this dojo.

277
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,950
Because my father protected it with his life.

278
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,450
And, there's so many fond memories 
of my father in every corner.

279
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,350
In every column, and in every tatami mat.

280
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,580
I.. I'll do something about it, jya!

281
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,830
You can't.

282
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,680
I'm tired of it all.

283
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,860
No way!

284
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,340
No way...

285
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,830
Did you hear?

286
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,240
Kaneko-san finally agreed to marry Saimonji.

287
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,800
He's scarred really deep.

288
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
Please hurry, Miss.

289
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,800
The President awaits you.

290
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,830
Are you sure this is right, Kaneko-san?

291
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,140
And, where is Jigoro-kun anyway?

292
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,470
Jigoro-san..

293
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,830
Ka.. Kaneko-san!

294
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,980
Kaneko-san!

295
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,600
Are you okay, Jigoro-kun?

296
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,560
I've had it. I've reached my limit!

297
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,630
Why that Saimonji!

298
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,380
Kaneko-san!

299
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,330
Marvelous! Kaneko-san!

300
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,420
You are the peak of beauty!

301
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,670
The ceremony is about to begin.

302
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,610
Well, my relatives will definitely
be amazed and shocked.

303
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,880
Brother, it's almost time for the ceremony.

304
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,010
Uh, let me introduce her to you. 
My sister, Saeko.

305
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,390
My!

306
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,310
I wondered what type of girl you 
were chasing but.. my!

307
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,460
What a wonderful country girl!

308
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,950
Shu.. shut up!

309
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,450
Kaneko-san!

310
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,270
I'm sorry. I.. I just can't...

311
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,900
I won't let you go! Kaneko-san!

312
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,350
Jigoro-san, don't!

313
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,670
Don't fight!

314
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,860
Eii, feel at least a hundredth of 
Kaneko-san's pain and suffering!

315
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,850
Jigoro-san!

316
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,430
Miss Kaneko!

317
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,360
Kaneko-san!

318
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
My father's judo isn't for fighting.

319
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,780
No way!

320
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,180
I didn't know that Kaneko-san was that strong.

321
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,710
I.. I'm sorry!

322
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,270
The proof of debt!

323
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,050
The man that threw a bear was 
defeated by a w.. woman?

324
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,600
I was fooled!

325
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,260
The man's name was Yoshinokawa Eiichi.

326
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,780
He soon published the classic tale, Miyamoto Musashi, and became famous.

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,080
That's a lie!

328
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,830
What's a lie?

329
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,900
Because.

330
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:42,260
If I wasn't thrown by Kaneko, the classic 
tale would've been, Inokuma Jigoro, 
not Miyamoto Musashi.

331
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,250
The last time you told it, weren't you 
two supposed to be models...

332
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,090
... for Kawabata Nariyasu's classic, Yuki Guni?
[Yuki Guni -- Snow Country]

333
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,880
H.. huh, uhh, well...

334
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,050
Kaneko was strong, so very strong.

335
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,380
Well, next is a new story arc for Yawara!

336
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,200
What new story arc?

337
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,390
What new story arc?
Of course, after taking Japan, next is the world!

338
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,320
Of course, after taking Japan, next is the world!

339
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,960
There are strong opponents 
all over the world.

340
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,040
There are strong opponents 
all over the world.
Geez, I'm busy with entrance exam studies.

341
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,670
Geez, I'm busy with entrance exam studies.

342
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,010
Geez, I'm busy with entrance exam studies.
Studies? You don't need to study
for global competitions.

343
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,820
Studies? You don't need to study

344
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,380
Not for judo, I mean for college entrance exams.

345
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,270
Next time, on "Yawara!" --

346
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,250
The Big Guest For Yawara.

347
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,370

you a kami shihoh gatame.
