00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,090
Now that's something you don't see every day!



5
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,880
They're not so much seeing her off as fighting over her.

6
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,680
You know one of those firms is going to get their hands on Inokuma.

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,830
Which makes her transfer to Saikai U a non-starter, right, Mr. <i>All Sports News</i> ?

8
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,520
She's not going to Saikai U, and she's not joining one of those three firms.</i>

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,570
The Opening Act of the Yugoslavia World Championships!

10
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,960
I'll root for you from my TV set.

11
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,580
Don't forget our souvenirs!

12
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,010
Still, Fujiko-san, isn't it great that you get to go?

13
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,750
Even though you're just a training player.






14
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,320
Hey!

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,540
Ow, what are you doing?

16
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,130
Honestly, I'm relieved.

17
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,250
If I was actually going to compete in the tournament, I'd be quaking with fear.

18
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,130
And also,

19
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,580
we have something else to look forward to, Inokuma-san!

20
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,140
What?

21
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,710
A stopover in Singapore!



22
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,360
We'll be staying overnight while we wait for our connecting flight.

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,110
That gives us lots of time to go shopping!

24
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,450
How lucky!

25
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,660
I wish I was going to the World Championships!

26
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,280
Don't you dare forget our souvenirs!

27
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,610
Let me through! Make way!

28
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,120
Fujiko-san!

29
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,620
Hanazono-san!



30
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,410
So you're finally going, Fujiko-san?

31
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,450
Whoo!
So you're finally going, Fujiko-san?

32
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,880
Way to go!

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,600
But remember, I'm just a training player.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,890
Still, it's amazing they chose you for that.

35
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,890
By comparison, I'm... I'm so...

36
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,920
utterly worthless!

37
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,390
Next time, we'll both go as members of the national team.

38
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,450
O-Of course!

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,330
Let's leave them alone.

40
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,380
I still can't believe they're a couple.

41
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,450
That's how guys and girls are, Yawara-chan.

42
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,460
Oh yeah, Tsurukame Travel might be coming.

46

Forgive me!

47
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,820
Look at the sizes and colors the other firms have!

48
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,930
Please forgive me!

49
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,560
Sir, it's Inokuma-san!

50
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm sorry!

51
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,140
Inokuma-san! Good luck!

52
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,190
See? She didn't even notice us!

53
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,650
Please forgive me!

54
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,730
Hold on!

55
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,280
Oh, and don't forget the Dior perfumes!

56
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,930
Thank you for taking the time to see me off.


57
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,240
We wish you the best. We'll be cheering for you when you're on TV.

58
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,290
Oh, it isn't much, but please accept this token.

59
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,890
Oh, you shouldn't have.

60
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,760
No, no, it's a very small token.

61
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,260
Do your best and bring back the gold medal.

62
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,790
I will!

63
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,260
Yawara!

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,770
Why are you dilly-dallying? Our flight's leaving!

65
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,690
Okay!

66
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,270
I'll see you.



67
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,540
Those guys look familiar.

68
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,530
Really?

69
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,270
What's this?

70
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,770
Grandpa!

71
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,120
Oh, umeboshi!

72
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,030
Tasty!

73
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,930
We know you'll miss the taste of Japan while you're in Eastern Europe.

74
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,660
Please enjoy these. Cordial Tsurukame Travel.




75
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,830
So that's how they tempted you?

76
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,800
Matsuda-san!

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,430
They didn't tempt me in any way!

78
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,220
Oh, Matsuda, I'm glad you came! Carry our luggage!

79
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,890
Wh-What is making them so heavy?

80
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,180
Food, obviously!

81
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,400
Really, "tempted"?

82
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,140
I-I didn't say that!

83
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,570
Yes, you did!
I-I didn't say that!

84
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,370
W-Well, maybe I did. I was only...

85
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,380
Fine. We'll talk about it later in Yugoslavia.

86
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,150
I'll be going there on business.

87
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,030
We won't be talking about anything.

88
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,090
You'll be too busy with your articles anyway.

89
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,860
N-Now wait!

90
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,090
Will you can it!

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,940
Why are you flappin' your gums? Shut up and carry the luggage!

God, she's so stubborn.</i>

93
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,670
Fujiko-san, fight hard!

94
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,770
What are you saying? She's not gonna compete!

95
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,700
Inokuma-san, good luck!

96
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,620
Seriously, don't forget the souvenirs!

97
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,000
She's really gone.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,540
She'll win, right?

99
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,630
She'll win. She'll definitely win!

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,140
It won't work.</i>

Oh no!

104
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,650
Wh-What's wrong?



105
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,780
I forgot to ask her to buy a Gucchi bag!

106
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,740
Matsuda-san, buy one for me!

107
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,660
Buy it yourself!

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,950

I think the recline function on this seat is broken.

163
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,350
Let's switch seats.

164
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,370
Don't worry. You need to rest for the tournament.

165
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,180
Are you sure?


166
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,880
If it gets too bad, let me know. I'll switch seats with you.

167
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,990
Sign: Free-Weight Class#

168
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,070
It's a darn shame she's only a training player.

169
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,060
Sign: Free-Weight Class
 Ito Fujiko#

170
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,020
Oh, come on.


171
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,450
We're finally here!

172
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,360
This place looks kind of bleak.

173
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,460
Nothing like Singapore.

174
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,380
Jody!

175
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,800
Yawara!

176
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,900
How have you been?

177
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,770
I'm glad you've recovered, Jody!

178
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,220
It's Jody Rockwell-san!

179
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,060
So this is the long-awaited reunion of two rivals? How exciting!

180
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:29,040
Are these people... competing in the world championships?</i>

181
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:34,240
I-I'm so glad I'm not on the national team!</i>

182
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,920
Th-Thank goodness for that—</i>

183
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,670
Oh, no!

184
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,740
Th-Thank you very much!

185
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,730
Japanese?

186
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,460
Y-Yes!

187
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,730
T-Teleko... Teleshikova.</i>

188
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,400
Yawara...

189
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,320
Yugo...

190
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,870
slavia!

191
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,080
And the beautiful, blue,

192
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,380
Danube!

193
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,370
Fujiko-san, stop dancing and let's run!

194
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,050
It's a shame that you won't be in the free-weight class.

195
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,420
Sorry, Jody.

196
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,860
The free-weight and the 48kg-and-under competitions are on the same day.

197
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,820
Forget about the 48kg-and-under and just do the free-weight class!

198
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,820
I can't do that. The Japanese national team makes the decisions.

199
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:35,710
If you're not going to enter, then I'll only compete in the 72 kg heavyweight class.








200
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:41,390
Teleshikova will be shocked, because she entered the free-weights just to face you.

201
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,340
Don't worry, Jody-san!

202
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,250
Inokuma-san can easily handle two classes in one day!

203
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,050
Geez, Fujiko-san, you have no consideration.

204
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,390
Oh, you're not competing, Fujiko?



205
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,060
That's right, and I'm happy about it.

206
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,770
Fujiko-san is acting just like a tourist.

207
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,480
All she does is buy gifts for her boyfriend back home.

208
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,030
Inokuma-san, you're embarrassing me!

209
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,000
What about your husband, Jody?

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,990
He's always come along as your coach.

211
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,440
My darling didn't come with me this time.

212
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,040
He has a weightlifting competition in Canada.

213
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,800
I'm spending a lot of money making international calls to him every day.

214
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm writing letters to him daily.

215
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,780
My darling eats a lot, but sadly I won't be able to serve him delicious food.

216
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,760
Hanazono-san always says my cooking is delicious.

217
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,910
Oh, so your boyfriend eats a lot too?

218
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,770
Yes. Just the other day he ate 20 onigiri, snarfed 20 boiled eggs,

219
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,270
and drank 20 bottles of milk like it was nothing!

220
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,740
A man that eats a lot can never be bad. You must be in heaven, Fujiko.

221
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,340
Oh please, Jody-san!

222
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,750
You guys are lucky to have men.

223
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,870
Oh, my gosh, Inokuma-san!

224
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,500
That's right, you have Matsuda in your life!

225
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Huh?

226
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,710
What?

227
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, so you're really seeing him?

228
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,080
I knew there was something going on with you two!






229
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
Nothing is going on!

230
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,530
You're still keeping up that act?

231
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,190
You should be a little more honest with your feelings!

232
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,900
Oh, really, you two! There's nothing between us!

233
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,160
What are you saying? The way he looks at you says more than you think.

234
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,950
So there <i>was</i> more to it, Inokuma-san?

235
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,130
Geez!

236
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,970
Matsuda will be coming here anyway to report on the games.

237
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,190
We'll give those two a helping hand, Fujiko.

238
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,050
A new romance could start in this foreign country.

239
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,420
Wait! Geez, there's nothing between us!





240
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,210
Not with him.</i>

241
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,810
Yamagata! Yamagata!

242
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,870
Excuse me! Coming through!

243
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,830
Let me through!

244
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,820
Kosaku! Are you listening, Kosaku?

245
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,270
You must come home now, Kosaku!

246
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:19,210
Your father... Your father... just suffered a cerebral hemorrhage!

247
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,710
Don't die, Dad!</i>

248
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,340
What do you think?

249
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,310
All our players are in peak form, right, Master Inokuma?

250
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,010
Yeah.

251
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,930
By the way, have you decided who's competing in the free-weight class?

252
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,900
No, we haven't.




253
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,940
If you keep looking, the one who's peaking right now should jump out at you.

254
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,640
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

255
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,530
Yawara-san's techniques do stand out the most, but...

256
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,540
As they should!



257
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,600
You know a good thing when you see it,
 Mr. Japanese Women's Coach.

258
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,190
Oh, why thank you!

259
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,550
But doing two weight classes in one day would be too much, even for Yawara-san.


260
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,510
Just think it over.

261
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,230
You have until the day before the free-weights to choose your player.

262
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,230
Right.


263
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,020
By the way, Master, what have you been writing all this time?

264
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,820
Autographing books!

265
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,530
Writing: The Gentle Way was not Built in a Day
 Inokuma Jigoro#
Autographing books!

266
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,530
All those foreign athletes will be falling over themselves to get my autograph.
Writing: The Gentle Way was not Built in a Day
 Inokuma Jigoro#

267
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,080
I'll even give you one. "To Yanagizawa-san."

268
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,130
Here!

269
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,890
Thank you very much!

270
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,230
And here we have "Sayzen Bach-san." Now that's a weird name.

271
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,050
Okay, now for "Anton da Silva-san"...

272
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,400
That's amazing, Inokuma-san! You're really in your groove!

273
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
Did it hurt, Fujiko-san?

274
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,100
Nope.

275
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,820
Tomorrow's the first day of the tournament. Everyone must be feeling tense.

276
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,740
I'll be sure to do my work,
 even without Kosaku around.

277
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,900
Maybe I should've gone to Yamagata with him.

278
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,490
The man who will be my father-in-law is in critical condition.

279
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,840
No, I must do my job here for Kosaku.

280
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh, this shot is amazing!

281
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,330
Don't take pictures without asking!

282
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,040
That was scary! She's not just tense,
 she's ready to erupt!

283
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,620
Did you say something?!

284
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,230
No, no, I didn't say anything! Nothing at all!

285
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,360
I must find someone less scary.

286
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,240
Like them! They look relaxed!

287
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,090
Hi, Yawara-chan! How are you?

288
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,870
Kuniko-san!

289
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,520
The camerawoman from <i>All Sports News ! Good day to you!</i>

290
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,800
Are you looking for someone?

291
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,300
No, not really.

292
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,300
Kosaku didn't come, you know.

293
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,850
Matsuda-san didn't come?

294
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,270
He never misses any of Inokuma-san's matches!

295
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,310
Maybe he got bored with her.

296
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,050
Bored?

297
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,720
Yawara-chan <i>has</i> become quite the superstar now!

298
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,730
Kosaku gets excited and bored with things really easily.

299
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,790
It's too bad he didn't come.

300
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,150
Inokuma-san?

301
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,230
This may be my chance.</i>

302
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,460
My chance to crush a romantic rival.</i>

303
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,830
Good evening, everyone in Japan.

304
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,020
Here we are at Pioneer Hall in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.



305
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,260
So this is the opening act of the tournament, commentator Yamashita-san.

306
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,290
It sure is. Here's hoping for a good tournament.

307
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:28,530
We'll be watching the semifinal match for the women's 72 kg heavyweight division.

308
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,630
Japan's Tohdoh has survived up to this point.

309
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,830
Yes, she's fought hard.

310
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,950
The Soviet Teleshikova is only going to compete in the free-weight class,

311
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,960
which makes Canada's Jody Rockwell the favorite to win the 72 kg heavyweights.





312
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,110
Win this one, Tohdoh!

313
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,970
If you get the gold medal,
 it'll put the rest of us at ease!

314
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,520
Todo-san!

315
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,250
Tohdoh appears to be out of shape since she's over the ideal weight,

316
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,160
but what do you think of her up till now, Yamashita-san?

317
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,220
I say she performed solidly today. However...

318
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,320
She's now facing Cuba's Martinez,

319
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,970
who's never appeared in an international tournament before.

320
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,980
We have no data on her.

321
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,750
Hajime!




322
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,910
You can hear the thud! I'm so glad I'm not playing!

323
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,210
Ow-Ow!

324
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,590
C'mere a minute.

325
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,710
M-Master Inokuma, you're hurting me!

326
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,150
Whatever, c'mere!

327
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,150
He got bored.


328
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,670
It's even scarier up close!

329
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,610
Give me one of your "un, deux, trois."

330
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,080
Pretend you're Tohdoh and you're timing your move against that Manekineko girl.

331
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,160
L-Let's see...

332
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,580
Okay, un, deux...




333
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,600
Wow! Martinez countered Tohdoh's Osoto and got a Yuko!

334
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,550
You idiot! She got you just now! Try again!

335
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,600
Right now! Un, deux...

336
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,690
Wow! Martinez gets a Kosoto Gari Ippon! Tohdoh is finished! 

337
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,690
You big dummy! You just lost by an Ippon!

338
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,190
You won't be returning to Japan wearing a medal that way.

339
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,660
Huh? A medal?

340
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,860
What's the deal? Tohdoh's out already?

341
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,050
This is gonna be a long tournament.

342
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,600
Kosaku didn't come. Maybe he's bored with her.

343
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,590
Kosaku gets excited and bored with things really easily.

344
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,880
He's bored with her.

346
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,680
Ah, the World Championships have finally started!

347
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,850
So you must be fit to be tied, aint'cha?

348
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,770
No, I'm not.

349
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,390
It's better to get two gold medals, or best of all, three!

350
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm not getting two or three no matter how much you want it.

351
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,410
Nobody's talking about you!

352
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,010
Now that we have all the familiar competitors here, let's see what's in store.

353
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,890
Yawara!

354
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,750
Jam-Packed with International Contenders!

355
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,480
You'll get my Kosoto Gari if you don't watch!
