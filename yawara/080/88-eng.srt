1
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,890
Things are at a fever pitch here in Belgrade's Pioneer Hall.

2
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,320
We're seeing something completely unexpected.

3
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,400
The Japanese freshman Ito Fujiko is putting up a really good fight!

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,400
What's with you, Teleshikova? Maintain your cool!

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,000
She's still angry that she won't get to fight Yawara Inokuma.

6
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,960
Fujiko-san, you can do it! You can win!

7
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,010
Ito's going all in!

8
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,930
Don't evade! Get her!




9
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,720
An Uchi Mata!

10
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,530
Swan Lake vs the Ura Nage!!
Giant Clash!

11
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,670
It's Ito's Uchi Mata!

12
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,990
Teleshikova brushes it off!

13
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,590
Fujiko-san!

14
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,360
Teleshikova's power is truly frightening!

15
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,320
Are you okay, Fujiko-san?
Teleshikova's power is truly frightening!

16
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,120
She threw Ito out of the ring with a Sukui Nage!

17
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,830
Hang on!
She threw Ito out of the ring with a Sukui Nage!

18
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,110
Are you all right, Fujiko-san?
She threw Ito out of the ring with a Sukui Nage!

19
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,600
Are you all right, Fujiko-san?

20
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,560
Inokuma-san.

21
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,060
Keep it together. You're almost done.

22
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,110
That's right.

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,200
There's even a chance that I'll...

24
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,870
Take a look here, folks!

25
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,180
The two bitter rivals who fought for the gold medal at the World Cup,

26
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,270
Inokuma and Teleshikova, are staring each other down!

27
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,850
Teleshikova!

28
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,580
Give that up now!

29
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,530
Your opponent is not Yawara. It's Ito!

30
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,250
Fujiko-san, you can do it.

31
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,290
Th-Thanks.

32
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,540
I...

33
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,000
I... might just...</i>


34
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,050
If I can just run out the clock...</i>

35
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,050
I might win.</i>

36
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,420
Now, Ito Fujiko holds a commanding lead with a Yuko and a Waza Ari!

37
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,520
There's less than one minute left!

38
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,350
Hajime!


39
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,910
Teleshikova wildly tries to grapple!

40
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,070
But Ito's having none of it, and she fends off the attacks!

41
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,120
No!


42
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,070
She'll get grabbed soon!

43
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,300
In any case, I don't believe Master Inokuma Jigoro has taught her how to play evasive judo.

44
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,520
So he really...

45
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,700
...never taught her...

46
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,090
...how to evade?

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
You bet your Maeda crackers I didn't!

48
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,740
Who plays judo by evading?

49
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,400
"Winning on points" ain't in my dictionary. Judo means getting an Ippon!

50
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,320
That's how Yawara learned judo!

51
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,050
Also, Teleshikova can always unleash an Ura Nage or a Sukui Nage,

52
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,570
even if her opponent tries to avoid them.

53
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,870
You can't evade those moves.




54
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,070
She's going to try something!

55
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,460
Fujiko-san, watch your footwork!

56
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
You flea!

57
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,760
Get lost!

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,260
Oh, no! Thrust out your right arm!

59
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,980
A Sumi Otoshi! 

60
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,270
Withstand it!

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,230
No! Let me go to the finals!

62
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,730
Waza Ari!


63
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,870
Teleshikova's Sumi Otoshi gets her a Waza Ari!

64
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,250
Ito struggled and twisted her body in order to avoid the worst!



65
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,030
Still, you gotta hand it to Teleshikova!

66
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,250
You think she only has power moves,
 but then she unleashes a Sumi Otoshi!

67
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,500
Still, I can't believe Ito withstood that.

68
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,220
Her balance and spring are all due to her incredible flexibility!

69
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,030
Don't worry. She may have a read on your rhythm,

70
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,230
but you can still use your Swan Lake and Nutcracker!

71
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,990
The Swan Lake and the Nutcracker. Just those two?</i>

72
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,730
I should've learned more moves!</i>





73
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,740
But it's nearly impossible to evade and run out the clock on her.</i>

74
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,700
I have to beat her using either my Swan Lake or the Nutcracker.</i>

75
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,210
Those are my only choices if I want to go the finals and win first place!</i>

76
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,390
Less than 30 seconds remain in this open-weight semifinal match!

77
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,920
Hajime!





78
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,230
Whoa! Ito goes for the grab!

79
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,760
And she grabbed a good spot, so she's taking her on.

80
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,500
But whether it's her Ouchi Gari or her Uchi Mata, timing is vital!

81
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,730
If she doesn't watch out, she could fall prey to Teleshikova's Ura Nage!

82
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,730
Teleshikova is looking for an opening.




83
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,780
Well, Beanpole is looking for an opening too.
 So who will make the first move?

84
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,700
The Swan Lake and the Nutcracker.
 I don't know if I can pull off either of them.</i>

85
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,210
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois...</i>

86
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,020
Un, deux, trois!

87
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,940
Un... Deux...

88
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,010
Trois!

89
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,430
It's her Ouchi Gari!

90
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,890
Beat her!

91
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,430
Lift her up!

92
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,690
It's the Ura Nage versus the Ouchi Gari!

93
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,160
No, Fujiko-san! Grab her leg firmly with yours!

94
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,140
Ippon! Done!

95
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,800
T-Teleshikova...

96
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Teleshikova delivers a punishing Ura Nage!

97
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,740
Teleshikova comes back with an Ippon!

98
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,250
Ito can't get up!

99
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,960
She took a real blow to the back of her head. Is she all right?

100
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,370
Fujiko-san!

101
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,830
Ito!

102
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,040
Are you all right?!

103
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,500
So, can Ito get up?

104
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,730
Fujiko-san.

105
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,750
Ito manages to get up.

106
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,830
Teleshikova's Ura Nage got her an Ippon right at the end!

107
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,680
Now she's off to the finals!

108
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,930
Fujiko-san?

109
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,780
I-Inokuma-san.

110
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,740
Are you okay?

111
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,230
I'm... useless.



112
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,780
No, you're not. You did your best.

113
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,880
Yawara Inokuma.</i>

114
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,910
Listen to this, folks.

115
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,220
You can hear the entire arena clapping for Ito's grand struggle.


116
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,200
Ito played a wonderful match! A magnificent fight!

117
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,210
No kidding.

118
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,920
Even if Teleshikova was off her usual form, it was truly marvelous.


119
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,920
I see good things happening for Ito Fujiko.

120
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,880
Listen to that applause, Fujiko-san!

121
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,250
Fujiko-san.

122
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,110
Crap! And she had such a huge lead!

123
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,860
She could've won by avoiding her!

124
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,790
Not bad, not bad.

125
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,290
That's my kind of judo.

126
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,850
Evasion is not judo. Winning with an Ippon is judo.

127
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,300
You did well, Beanpole.

128
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,370
Now, there's some time before the final match. Let's eat!

129
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,120
Ito might've been defeated in the open-weights,

130
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,110
but the Japanese national team still has the 48 kg Inokuma Yawara!

131
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,050
After this three-hour intermission, we'll have the championship match this evening!

132
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,330
Mister, didn't that just say Belgrade?

133
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,870
Yes.

134
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,830
All right, we're finally here!



135
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,020
Yawara-san, I'm coming!

136
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,690
Wow, you should've been there, sir!

137
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,350
It was so thrilling that even my crotch was sweating!

138
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,620
Those Soviet players are pro wrestlers, I tell you!


139
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,350
They were doing backdrops! Backdrops!

140
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,320
Sh-She's facing opponents that good?

141
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,820
She won, right? Of course she did. Didn't she?


142
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,830
Well, she did put up a good fight,
 but she just wasn't strong enough.

143
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,830
Wasn't strong enough?!

144
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,460
Yeah, she needed a little more "oomph," but she lost to a backdrop.

145
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,050
Lo...

146
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,600
Ah, sir! What's wrong? Water! Bring him water!

147
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,980
Y-Yes, sir!

148
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,830
H-Hello? Did Inokuma Yawara really lose?

149
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,640
No way. I was talking about that beanpole, Ito Fujiko!

150
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,140
Sign: All Sports News#

151
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,570
I-Is that right?

152
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,620
So she lost, huh?

153
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,410
But still, Fujiko-san is incredible.


154
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,990
She scored a Yuko and a Waza Ari against Teleshikova-san.

155
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,550
See, Hanazono-kun, it's no big—

156
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Don't... Don't cry. Don't cry over your loss, Fujiko-san!

157
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,590
I-Inokuma will definitely get revenge for you!

158
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,920
Th-That's right, Inokuma!
 How's Inokuma doing, Kuni-chan?

159
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,930
Yawara-chan? She did make it to the finals,
 but she's going to lose.

160
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,970
Lose? Kuni-chan,

161
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,190
is Inokuma that off her game?

162
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,740
Inokuma!

163
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,980
You can do it, Yawara-chan!

164
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,940
Come on. She's totally out of it.

165
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,050
I really don't think she's going to win the next one.

166
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,590
She's going to face that terrifying Khrushchev.

167
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,740
Boss, a woman who looks like a journalist is saying the same thing!
She's going to face that terrifying Khrushchev.

168
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,490
Boss, a woman who looks like a journalist is saying the same thing!

169
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,950
Inokuma's not going to win.

170
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,310
What are you saying?

171
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,570
Inokuma Yawara is not going to be beaten that easily!

172
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,710
Now get her that present and cheer for her!

173
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,940
Understood, Boss. The present is ready for her.

174
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,460
Now I may be speaking out of turn here,

175
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,280
but if you're gonna cheer for someone, make it Ito Fujiko!

176
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,220
Inokuma may be cute, but that's all there is to her.

177
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,420
Ito's the better pick!

178
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,730
You dope!
Ito's the better pick!

179
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,650
Who cares about Ito Fujiko?

180
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,730
Inokuma Yawara is the one joining our company!

181
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,780
Inokuma Yawara will join our ranks

182
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,560
and make Tsurukame Travel a household name worldwide!

183
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,070
Th-This is bad! So she wasn't our boss's little fetish?

184
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,860
Did you get her a present?

185
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:28,160
Oh, you told me to get her panties because our boss was just lusting after her.

186
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,010
Did you actually buy panties?

187
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,950
Yeah, some really risqué ones!

188
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,730
You dumbass! Buy something normal!


189
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,130
Geez, don't you know how embarrassed I was?

190
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,470
Boss, we're going now to show Inokuma Yawara-san our support.

191
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,920
Tell her, "Good luck"? You got it!
Boss, we're going now to show Inokuma Yawara-san our support.

192
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,690
Yes, understood. Yes! Yes, sir!
Tell her, "Good luck"? You got it!

193
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,620
Are you really okay, Fujiko-san?

194
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,150
Fit as a fiddle! Nothing wrong here!

195
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,620
I'm encouraged by you, Fujiko!

196
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,680
Now, Yawara has her 48kg-and-under finals,

197
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,960
and Fujiko has her third-place match.

198
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,770
What? I'm going to be in the third-place match?

199
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,380
That's right. If you win, you'll get the bronze medal!

200
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,840
Bronze medal?

201
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,620
Oh, my gosh! I may still be able to bring back a medal!

202
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,850
That's right. You can do it, Fujiko-san.

203
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,360
You also need to do all you can for the gold medal!

204
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,860
Sure.


205
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,520
Don't worry. Matsuda-san is definitely cheering for you.

206
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,360
That's right.

207
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,940
Yeah.

208
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,140
What the hell?!

209
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,800
And just when we entered the Belgrade city limits!

210
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,950
What kind of traffic is this?

211
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,080
Rush hour!

212
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,350
Mister, I'm getting out. I might make it if I run.

213
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,050
Wait! Do you know Pioneer Hall?

214
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,770
I can ask around, even without knowing the language!

215
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,590
Wait! Where you go?

216
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,470
Wait!


217
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,870
All right, Ito, put this away!

218
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,790
Compared to Teleshikova, all the other players are nothing, you hear me?

219
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,780
Yes!

220
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,050
She's got heart!

221
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,790
Yes, get the bronze!

222
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,250
Fujiko-san, don't forget your own pace.

223
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,750
Yep, "un, deux, trois," right?

224
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,520
It's like Fujiko's standing a full head taller.

225
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,260
Yeah, so tall that I can barely see that head now.

226
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,650
But next time I'm gonna train her harder,

227
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,110
and we ain't going for some cheap medal like the bronze either.

228
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,400
We're taking the gold, baby!

229
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,740
Okay, I'll be going.


230
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,660
Be strong.

231
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,590
I'll fight and win the bronze medal.

232
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,460
That'll give you some momentum for your final match.

233
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,330
Thanks.

234
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,340
Here she is, Ito Fujiko, Japan's promising newcomer!

235
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,800
Listen to those cheers!

236
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,350
Ito, who fought evenly with Teleshikova, is a popular figure here in Belgrade!



237
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,350
Facing her is the player who lost resoundingly to Teleshikova in the third round,

238
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,350
South Korea's Kim Gyeong Suk!

239
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,630
That's right! She's no match for you!


240
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,690
Don't hold back. Go after her!

241
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,650
Hajime!

242
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,930
Go get her!

243
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,910
Yes, get a good hold on her!

244
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,350
That's right! Go, go, go!

245
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,240
Waza Ari!

246
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,910
What are you, stupid?!

247
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,680
Who the hell would fall for such an obvious Deashi Barai!

248
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,140
Oh, Ito's in trouble!

249
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,050
Kim Gyeong Suk is pinning her tightly with an Ude Garami!

250
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,720


251
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,530
Enough of that squealing!




252
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,480
What the hell are you doing?

253
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,370
Get up!
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,180
Do something!

255
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,640
Fujiko-san!

256
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,250
Fujiko!

257
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,680
Nothing doing here.

258
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,110
Ippon! Done!

259
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,110
What just happened here?

260
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,130
Ito was so good during her match with Teleshikova-san,

261
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,660
but she lost the bronze medal match in the blink of an eye!

262
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,470
Fujiko-san!

263
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,670
We're beating you into shape.

264
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,380
Fujiko-san.

265
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,670
Inokuma-san,

266
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,220
instead of giving you some momentum, I took the wind right out of your sails!

267
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,970
Wait, no.

268
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,600
Do you know Pioneer Hall?

269
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,730
Come on, Pioneer Hall!

270
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,610
All right!

271
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,120
You're almost up, Khrushchev.

272
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,620
Okay.


273
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,330
Listen, even though she's off her game, she's still Yawara.

274
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,620
Always maintain your focus.

275
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,250
I give my all, no matter whom I play.

276
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,630
Even if Yawara is not that good of a player.

277
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,590
You don't get it, Khrushchev.

278
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,850
You don't have a clue how terrifying she is.


279
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,880
You don't really know whether she's good or not.

280
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,850
I'll be the one to show you, Teleshikova.

281
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,850
Inokuma-san.

282
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,520
It's amazing how good you need to be to play internationally.

283
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,850
Someone like me can never get by on pure luck.



284
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,370
Come on, what happened wasn't luck.

285
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,540
But I know you can do it, Inokuma-san!

286
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,370
You'll win because you're that good!

287
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,040
I'm...

288
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,970
I'm... starting to feel I didn't win all those matches with my own strength.

289
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,950

290
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,450
Wait for me! I'm coming!</i>

291
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,070
I-It's almost six! The finals will...

292
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,130
Yawara-san's match is about to begin!

293
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,630
D-Dammit!

294
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,110
Yawara-san, I'm coming!

295
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,160
Come on!

296
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,710
Leave it to me!

297
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,030
Mister...

298
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,290
Inokuma, you're up.

299
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,380
Okay.

300
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,490
Inokuma-san...</i>

301
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,940
We...

302
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,370
W-We're here!

303
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,940
Pioneer Hall!

Yawara! Beanpole used her own strength and played excellent judo!

306
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,640
It's too bad how things ended, but Fujiko-san was amazing.

307
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,690
This ain't no time to act impressed! You're up next!





308
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,820
That Khuruchin girl's Ura Nage is up against your Ippon Zeoi! 

309
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,330
It's a head-on fight, so knock her dead!

310
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,930
Right.

311
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,900
Yawara!
