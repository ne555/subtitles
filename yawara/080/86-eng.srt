1
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,240
Geez, our company president needs to cut down on his little hobbies.

2
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,700
A man his age telling us to go see Inokuma Yawara's match and send him updates?

3
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,710
I didn't know the president of Tsurukame Travel was a judo fan.

4
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,450
Yeah, more of an Inokuma Yawara fan, I'd say.

5
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,010
Just another dirty old man, huh?



6
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,160
But why would he make us, the Frankfurt branch,

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,970
take part in his pastime by flying us all the way over here?

8
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,040
Yeah, he'll see her on TV in Japan anyway, with just a one day delay.


9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,730
Oh, it's a live one.

10
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,980
Perfect! Just in time for her match!

11
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,750
Wow, she's cute! I think I'm in love!

12
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,410
Then why don't you try making a pass at her like she's a normal girl?

13
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,500
Waza Ari!

14
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,490
All right! She won, right?

15
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,610
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,210
He just said "Waza Ari."

17
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,470
Do you know anything about judo?

18

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,850
Just from what I picked up in gym class. You must know a lot about it.

19
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,940
Just about Ippon and Waza Ari.

20
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,560
Yuko!

21
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,430
Sir.

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,310
What was that "Yuko" he said right now?


23
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,790
"Y-Yuko" is... well, "friendship," right?

24
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,370
So that means...
Oh, it's Yamashita!
"Y-Yuko" is... well, "friendship," right?

25
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:12,770
"Y-Yuko" is... well, "friendship," right?
So that means...

26
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,250
"Y-Yuko" is... well, "friendship," right?

27
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,530
Hey, I'm talking here!

28
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:15,960
Yamashita?

29
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,960
Yamashita's doing the color commentary!

30
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,790
Let's go!

31
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,540
He'll give us the results!

32
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:22,960
Okay.

33
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,060
He gave a stirring performance at the Seoul Olympics!

34
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,520
Idiot! That was at Los Angeles!

35
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,290
Oh, really?

36
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,480
Inokuma's not faring well in the second round.

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,520
If she was on form, she'd have obtained an Ippon by now.

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,490
No kidding. Her opponent was completely vulnerable when she got that Waza Ari.

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,570
I've never seen Inokuma so off her game.

40
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,380
Did you hear that?

41
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,580
Yes, I did.

42
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:53,580
The Top and Bottom of their Games!

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,340
What's up with Matsuda?

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,300
Has anyone heard from Matsuda?!

46
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,110
Huh? Isn't he in Yamagata?

47
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,310
He went back to his parents because his dad got sick, didn't he?

48
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,770
You're wrong.




49
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,370
Matsuda went to Yugoslavia.

50
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,910
Are you sure?

51
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,750
Or maybe he didn't go?

52
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,810
That idiot wouldn't go off on a pleasure trip somewhere, would he?

53
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,440
Hey, I thought I told you we're busy!

54
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,700
Save it for tomorrow.


55
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,710
But there must've been some word from Matsuda-san!

56
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,480
Chief, do something about these guys!

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,290
H-Hey!

58
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,470
You're the editor, aren't you?
 I'm Hanazono from Ebitendo U.

59
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,540
And you guys are from MWJC?

60
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,540
Please give us whatever information you've received from Belgrade!

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,560
Fujiko-san's playing in the World Championships, right?

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Y-Yeah.

63
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,520
If you're a sports newspaper, then you must have the latest updates.

64
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,130
The latest updates, huh?

65
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,030
You've received calls from Matsuda-san, haven't you?

66
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,990
Matsuda should have gone there.

67
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,230
What do you mean by "should"?

68
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,000
What are our Frankfurt guys doing?




69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Her match must've started ages ago!

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,570
Don't worry.

71
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,740
No news is good news, right?

72
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,450
That's right. Inokuma Yawara is only competing in the 48kg-and-unders this time.

73
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,730
That will be an easy group for her.

74
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,650
Despite what you're all saying, I'm still worried!



75
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,980
Yeah, you're right. There's really no telling what's going to happen. 

76
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,160
And there's still a slight chance she might...

77
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,160
"A slight chance"?!

78
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,250
Are you saying Inokuma Yawara might lose to someone? Like who?!

79
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,660
Huh?!

80
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,720
Sir, you have a call from Murakami,
 section chief of the Frankfurt branch.

81
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,840
I-It's here!

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,850
Put him on.

83
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,270
Right away.

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,170
Oh, is this Murakami-kun?

85
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,390
What happened?

86
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,900
So how did Inokuma Yawara do?


87
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,300
Well, we're right in the middle of her second round match,

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,650
but she's way off her game.

89
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,610
Wh-What did you say?!

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,020
What? Did something happen?

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,500
Yamashita was giving a rundown in the TV booth.

92
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,100
We listened in, so this info is solid.

93
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,460
Inokuma Yawara is at the bottom of her game.

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,770
You heard him.

95
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,380
B...

96
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,390
Bottom of her game?!

97
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,820
I... I hope those umeboshi we gave her as a farewell gift didn't cause diarrheal food poisoning!

98
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,440
S-Sir, that couldn't have happened!

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,650
S-So Inokuma Yawara still hasn't lost, has she?

100
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,850
Hello? Hello?!

101
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,870
It's dead.

102
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,880
Whaâ€” What'll we do?!

103
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,370
Sir, please calm down!

104
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,550
Inokuma, who has failed to show her usual precision,

105
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,670
reaches the end of her four minute match!

106
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,170
Done!

107
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,180
Time's up! Thanks to her Waza Ari and Yuko,
 Inokuma Yawara wins on points!

108
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,220
She just barely makes it to the third round!

109
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,950
Sh-She won.

110
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,230
That put me in a cold sweat.

111
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,090
Yawara...

112
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,730
Inokuma-san...

113
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,780
You blithering idiot!

114
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,420
A Waza Ari?!

115
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,780
You had millions of chances to get an Ippon in that danged match!


116
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,290
I'll whip some character into you! Ten laps around the arena!

117
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,680
Master, don't be unreasonable!

118
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,290
Lemme go, Kazamidori!

119
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,130
Yawara! You hear me?!

120
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,590
At least you won.

121
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,510
She's right! That's amazing, Inokuma-san!

122
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,320
Yeah.

123
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,860
Inokuma-san, cheer up.</i>

Don't worry. I have photos from all the matches.

Oh, and Yawara-chan looks like she's totally off her game.

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
What?!


149
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,540
N-Now wait a minute. That's fine, but...

150
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,710
You're saying it's Inokuma Yawara, not Ito Fujiko, who's off her game?

151
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,830
Well, she normally wins her matches in a blink of an eye,

152
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,470
but she hasn't even scored an Ippon yet.

153
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,060
What is she saying?

154
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,300
So how's Fujiko-san? The one who's playing in the open-weights.

155
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,240
Hello? Hello?

156

Hello?!

That moron. I can't write an article based on that phone call!

158
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,280
What is Matsuda doing?




159
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,260
We were all worried about Fujiko-san, but now Yawara-chan too?

160
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,250
Did Yawara-chan lose?

161
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,790
What's happened?

162
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,300
What on earth has happened in Belgrade?!

163
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,090
Un!

164
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
Deux!

165
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,800
Trois!

166
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,180
Ippon!

167
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,090
Holy cow, Ito!

168
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,230
What incredible judo. This is nothing like what we saw in the first round!



169
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,970
She can do this, Yamashita-san!

170
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,330
Her play has suddenly changed for the better.

171
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,730
Maybe she loosened up after the first round?

172
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,420
Impressive, Master! She's our secret weapon!

173
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,120
She still has a long way to go before she'll get a passing grade from me.

174
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,160
Yawara doesn't even get a zero.

175
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,040
Nice match, Fujiko!

176
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,120
Fujiko-san!

177
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,110
Inokuma-san!

178
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,670
I won again!

179
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,170
I'm doing my best, so you should too.

180
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,940
She's right! You need to try harder!

181
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,140
Jody.

182
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,140
Matsuda is cheering for you from Japan.



183
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,110
Oh, man.

184
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,490
These tires are totally bald. Of course you'd get a flat!

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,370
That's it. I'm taking over!

186
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,790
It'll take you until tomorrow to change the tire!

187
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,550
Oh!

188
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,260
Don't "Oh" me! Stop acting amazed, and go get the spare!

189
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,010
Now I'll never make it.

190
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,820
Not that it would matter if I were there anyway.</i>

191
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,420
Even if I'm not, Yawara-san will still...</i>

192
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,670
Da...</i>

193
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,560
Dammit!

194
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,780
I'm going! I'll definitely be there!</i>

195
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,640
I'll be there, Yawara-san!</i>

196
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,450
Matsuda-san.

197
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,200
Ippon!

198
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Teleshikova with a fearsome Ura Nage!

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,760
She advances to the third round of the open-weight competition!

200
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,690
Yamashita-san, she seems to be getting more intense!

201
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,910
You're right about that.

202
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,720
But everyone needs to watch the next two matches.

203
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,690
Can you do that move in judo, Murakami, sir?

204
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,730
She grabbed her waist and backdropped her!

205
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,200
Just as Yamashita-san said, Khrushchev is in the 48kg-and-unders at Ring A.

206
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:51,200
Then Kristin Adams from Canada is in the open-weights at Ring B.





207
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,750
Oh, take a look, folks.

208
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,310
Teleshikova, who just won, and Adams, who's about to play, are on the floor.

209
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,170
Their eyes met as they passed each other!

210
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,290
So what do you say, Yamashita-san?

211
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,550
It looks like the open-weights will come down to those two.

212
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:15,650
Yes, Canada's Adams dominated the 61kg-and-unders and is now hitting her stride!

213
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,820
Wow! In the 48kg-and-under ring, Khrushchev has quickly...

214
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,680
What an earth-shattering Kata Guruma!

215
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,830
She has powerful arms for someone so small!





216
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,320
If Inokuma Yawara makes it to the finals,
 she'll undoubtedly have to face Khrushchev!

217
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,870
They can do that too?

218
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,330
Th-That's a body slam!

219
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,800
And meanwhile, in the open-weight ring!

220
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,300
Canada's Adams with a Harai Makikomi! 

221
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,970
Ippon! Done!



222
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,130
How fierce! The judo of these foreign players is incredibly fierce!

223
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,280
What impressive drive.

224
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,760
Inokuma in the 48kg-and-unders, and Ito in the open-weights,

225
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,940
will be facing insurmountable barriers if they aren't careful!

226
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,900
You heard him.

227
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,950
We need to call the Tsurukame home office quick!

228
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,520
What's making you so danged sloppy, you dingbat?!

229
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,690
This ain't judo, it's an octopus dance!




230
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,790
Has going to all those "descoteques" rotted you down to the marrow?! 

231
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,990
Master, it's almost the third round!

232
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,010
Lemme go, Joe-day! If she won't listen, then she needs to be thrown down!

233
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,960
Come on! Letâ€”

234
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,010
Listen!

235
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,720
Play like that again, and I'm dragging you back to Japan by the scruff of your neck!

236
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,340
Master!

237
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,210
Joe-day, lemme go!

238
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,490
No!
Joe-day, lemme go!

239
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:44,940
Don't make me try my judo flip on you.
No!

240
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,440
Don't make me try my judo flip on you.

241
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,240
I... I can't believe I've only noticed it now.</i>

242
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,710
Kosaku got bored.

243
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,510
One thing has changed: that loudmouth Matsuda-san isn't around.

244
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,030
I...

245
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
What?!

246
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,210
Y-You're saying the foreign players are that strong, Murakami-kun?

247
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,910
Yeah, the commentator, Yamashita, said it himself, so you know it's true.

248
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:54,220
The Japanese players had better watch out. They're facing backdrops and body slams!

249
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,220
Backdrops? Wait, that's a pro-wrestling move!

250
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,190
It <i>is</i> pro wrestling! A person can get killed out there. I mean it!

251
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,710
G-Get killed?!

252
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,820
G-Give that to me!

253
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,820
Murakami-kun! It's me, Otaguro!

254
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,990
Sir!




255
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,670
A-Anyway, tell Inokuma Yawara that in Japan Tsurukame Travel is rooting for her!

256
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,990
And be sure to give her the present!

257
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,030
Ah!

258
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,460
What's with that "Ah"?! Huh?

259
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,180
Hello? Hello?

260
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,760
The phone's dead. What's going on?

261
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,840
And what's with that "Ah"?!

262
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,330
Ah...

263
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,600
I forgot the present.

264
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,930
Sign: All Sports News Daily Newspaper Company#

265
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,600
So?
Sign: All Sports News Daily Newspaper Company#

266
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,600
How are the matches going, Kuni-chan?

267
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,610
They're really amazing! The foreign players are really amazing!

268
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,210
Especially those Soviet players. They actually scare me!

269
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,240
I was about to cry!

270
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,350
By Soviet, you mean Teleshikova and Khrushchev, right?

271
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,240
A-And what about Inokuma and Fujiko-san?



272
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,240
Yawara-chan? I think she's about to start her match.

273
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,640
You think she's about to start?

274
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,250
Then what are <i>you</i> doing there?

275
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,800
Talking on the phone with you, silly!

276
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,720
You twit! Get to her match, for crying out loud!

277
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,720
So that means Inokuma and Fujiko-san have won?



278
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,790
So what round are theyâ€”

279
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,690
She hung up.

280
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,310
And Matsuda-san? What happened to him?

281
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,320
I'd like an answer myself!

282
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,200
Hey, what's going on, Mister?

283
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,190
Why are we taking this side road? This won't take us to Belgrade.

284
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,700
Lunch! Lunch!

285
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,500
L-Lunch?!

286
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,460
There's no time to eat lunch!

287
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,420
In the third round, Inokuma Yawara is once again off her game!

288
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,180
As she plays the Frenchwoman MorÃ©chand, her usual skills still haven't returned!

289
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,390
Get her, Inokuma!

290
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,680
Get on your game and win it quick!

291
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,770
Yuko!

292
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,650
Good!




293
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,280
You're doing great! Now run out the clock!

294
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,490
Whaddaya mean, "great"? Whaddaya mean, "run out the clock"?

295
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,280
That ain't what you call judo!

296
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
Hajime!

297
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,390
Inokuma-san.</i>

298
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,950
Good luck. I'll also do my best.</i>

299
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,550
Hajime!

300
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,800
Wait, you're kidding me?

301
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,810
A hot dog and coffee costs 45,000 dinara?

302
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,810
Wh-What kind of country is this?
 Besides, I only have American dollars.

303
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,870
Mister?

304
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,820
Mister!

305
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,530
We don't have time to sit here and eat!

306
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,820
We're eating in the car, and that's final!

307
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,330
Help me out here! If we don't hurry, the judo tournament will be over!

308
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,330
Judo?

309
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,370
Are you going to judo championship?

310
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,260
Right, right! Yes! The Judo World Championship?

311
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Mister, you've heard of it!


312
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,820
Oh, I like judo!

313
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,770
Oh, is that so? Very good!

314
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,230
And I really have to get to Yawara-san's match!

315
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,660
Yawara?

316
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,480
Yawara! Yawara!

317
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,050
If we're on the same page, then let's jet.

318
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,280
Yawara! Yawara!
If we're on the same page, then let's jet.

319
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,780
Mister, you know Yawara-san?

320
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,510
Yawara? Yes, I know.

321
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,790
She's very cute and strong.

322
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,190
This old guy in a faraway country knows her?

323
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,760
You've really become a global superstar, Yawara-san.

324
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,730
This is no time to get emotional.

325
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,770
The final match is six o'clock!

326
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,280
The championship...

327
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,030
I hope you reach it, Yawara-san.

328
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,450
Hurry up!

329
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,160
Hey!

330
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,160
I-I haven't paid yet!

331
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,920
Wait, you paid for mine, Mister?

332
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,910
Huh? Is 45,000 dinara that cheap?

333
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,630
Hey!

334
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,140
Wh-What?

335
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,390
Are you Yawara's fiancÃ©?

336
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,600
Oh, my sweetheart, Yawara!

337
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,780
D-Don't be stupid!

338
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:02,960
Good! Good!

339
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,780
Not "good"! You've got the wrong idea!

340
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,070
Inokuma fails yet again to get an Ippon!

341
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,290
The judge's decision gives her a narrow victory, thanks to her two Yukos!

342
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,290
You won, Inokuma-san?</i>

343
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,290
Un, deux, trois... Un, deux, trois...</i>

344
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,300
Un, deux, trois...</i>

345
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,020
Un! Deux! Trois!

346
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,760
Ippon! Done!

347
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,840
Ito's done it again! This time with an Uchi Mata!



348
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,210
Her first two matches might've been polar opposites, but she's the real deal, folks!

349
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,690
She's that good!

350
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,650
All right! Take that!

351
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,650
Good! Good!
All right! Take that!

352
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,380
Ito and Inokuma have somehow made it to the semifinals.

353
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,800
Um, Coach?

354
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,700
Why the long face?



355
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,180
Well, Inokuma's opponent isn't much,

356
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,710
but in the open-weights, Ito Fujiko's about to face...

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,590
Te?!

360
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,760
Yes, Ito's up against Teleshikova in the semifinals!

361
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,970
Teleshikova...

362
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,510
Inokuma-san, cheer up! I'm sure Matsuda-san is rooting for you!

363
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,180
So, come on!

364
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,750
Yeah.



365
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,520
You must be winning, Yawara-san.</i>

366
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,690
Even without me, you're scoring Ippon victories.</i>

367
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:46,430
Mister! At this rate, we'll die before we reach Belgrade!

You stupid little girl!

370
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,860
You wanna do octopus dances that much,
then hop in the water and swim back to Japan!

Matsuda-san.

372
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,050
And while you're at it, try practicing against some Pacific whales.

373
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,070
Hey, are you listening?!

374
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,400
Why am I only noticing it now?

375
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Why not follow Beanpole's example?

376
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,890
That's right! Fujiko-san is facing Teleshikova next!

377
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,020
Yawara!
