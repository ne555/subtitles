00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,030
Myth of Invincibility!

2
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,970
Inokuma-san. Don't worry about Matsuda-san.</i>

3
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,800
He not the type of man who gets excited and bored easily.</i>


4
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,480
He's always watching over you.</i>

5
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,140
Please let me be on time!

6
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,850
Let me through! Excuse me!

7
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,940
Hey, you!

8
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,850
Yawara-san.

9
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,080
We made it! It's her championship match!

10
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,830
Hey, you!

11
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,100
Make it happen, Yawara-san!

12
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,810
Yawara!

13
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,340
Damn, the upper seating is too far away!

14
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,840
Screw this!

15
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,130
No! No, no, no, no, no!

16
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,800
Let me through. I'm with her!

17
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,840
I.D. card! I.D. card!

18
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,700
I don't have an I.D. card! I just got here!

19
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,310
No!

20
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,910
This is the final match for the women's 48kg-and-under weight class

21
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,310
at the World Judo Championships.

22
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,220
We have Japan's Inokuma Yawara,
 who's struggled the entire tournament.

23
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,320
Will she return to her normal game?

24
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,490
On the other hand, her opponent's in top form!

25
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,330
The Soviet Khrushchev has won all her matches with Ippons!

26
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Can Japan's previously undefeated Inokuma win another gold medal here in Yugoslavia?

27
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,830
Inokuma-san!

28
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Inokuma-san, get it together!

29
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,170
Fight for it, Yawara!




30
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,840
Remember, fire in your belly!

31
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,300
Okay.

32
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,190
God, can't you be a bit flexible?

33
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,310
Do you know what I've been through to get here from Japan?

34
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,550
No.

35
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,060
Hey, come on!

36
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,130
Come on!

37
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,570
Yawara-san, I'll get closer to you!

38
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,590
Don't start your match yet!


39
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,690
The judges have bowed at the center of the ring.

40
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,540
The women's 48 kg championship match is finally underway!

41
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,250
Yamashita-san,

42
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,010
this match hinges on whether or not
 Inokuma gets back to her usual form.

43
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,360
Yes. Though there seems to be nothing wrong with her physically,

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,050
mentally she has problems.

45
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,890
Whether or not she can overcome them here is a major concern.

46
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,660
But even if Yawara plays at her full potential, her opponent is very formidable.

47
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,040
The position Inokuma assumes for her famous Ippon Zeoi

48
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,370
gives Khrushchev an excellent chance for an Ura Nage.




49
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,080
If she doesn't do her Ippon Zeoi at lightning speed,

50
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,530
Khrushchev can easily exploit that move.


51
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,540
Th-The two contenders approach the center!

52
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,040
Where's the arena entrance?

53
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,970
Go ahead!

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
N-Now look, I really need to see this match.

55
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,090
Oh, man.</i>

56
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,550
This is what happens when you do a little flirting.</i>

57
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,300
Matsuda-san?

58
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,430
No way.

59
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,300
Right now he's back in Japan,
 busy with his third-rate reporting.

60
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,810
Stop!

61
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,900
Is this also a no-go?

62
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,320
Bow!

63
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,610
Hajime!

64
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,330
The opening salvo has been launched!

65
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,490
Will Inokuma or Khrushchev win the gold?

66
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,960
Show me you're as good as Teleshikova says you are!

67
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,550
How the hell did you get to be a world champion, you empty shell!

68
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,210
I'm telling you I'm with her, card or no card!

69
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,700
If you don't have your I.D. card,
I'm telling you I'm with her, card or no card!

70
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,060
If you don't have your I.D. card,

71
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,560
you're not allowed to enter.

72
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,560
So you can't tell who a person is without some dumb piece of paper?

73
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,630
Hey.

74
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,570
Over there!

75
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,740
Yay!


76
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,240
Emergency! Grab that guy!

77
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,490
Hey! Hey, stop! Hey!

78
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,130
Let me go! Let me get to her! Yawara-san!

79
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,000
Inokuma-san, hang in there!

80
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,730
Inokuma's shrinking back completely!

81
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,260
Is this part of her strategy? Or is she that off her game?

82
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,270
Will her... Will her myth of invincibility shatter here tonight?

83
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,230
I need backup!

84
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,770
Yawara-san!

85
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,420
What's with you? Focus on the match, Yawara!

86
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,410
Ten-four. On my way.

87
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,580
Don't let her get a good hold on you!

88
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,910
Yawara-san!

89
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,690
Don't tell me...

90
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,680
Inokuma-san, you can do it!

91
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,480
Come on! You can confirm my identity with an international call or something!

92
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,490
If I don't go now, Yawara-san's... Yawara-san's match will be over.

93
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,490
Matsuda!

94
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,450
Jody!

95
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,370
Jody?

96
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,460
Jody Rockwell?

97
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,130
Jody!





98
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,430
What are you doing?
Jody!

99
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,940
I'll explain later!

100
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,500
Yawara-san! Yawara-san!</i>

101
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,840
Yawara-san. Yawara-san!</i>

102
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,800
You can do it, Yawara-san!

103
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,300
Throw her down in one stroke like you always do!

104
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,980
Ma... Ma...

105
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,310
All Sports.

106
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,850
You little!

107
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,830
Ah! Matsuda-san!

108
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,890
What kept you, Matsuda?

109
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,850
Inokuma-san! We have Matsuda-san!

110
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,570
It's Matsuda!

111
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,650
No good. The crowd is too loud for her to hear us.

112
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,950
Yawara!

113
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,540
Go, go, Yawara!

114
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,540
Let's go, Yawara!

115
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,530
What a loud voice.


116
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,590
Well, he gets that from singing a lot.

117
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,840
Let's go, Yawara!

118
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,900
Go, go, Yawara!

119
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,580
Let's go, Yawara!

120
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,100
Go, go, Yawara!

Let's go, Yawara!

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,070
Go, go, Yawara!

Yawara-san.</i>

124
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,540
If you're not gonna fight, I'll just end it right here!

125
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,790
A Kouchi Gari? I can see that move from a mile away!

126
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,540
When doing a Kouchi Gari, you pull in your opponent's hips, just like that!

127
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,540
I was counting on you doing that!

128
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,300
Do your Ura Nage!

129
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,260
Gotcha!



130
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,050
Too fast!</i>

131
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,020
Matsuda-san!

132
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,610
Ippon!

133
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,660
There it is! Her Ippon Zeoi!

134
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,170
Inokuma Yawara wins the gold medal!

The Soviet Khrushchev finally gets up! And she's completely dumbfounded!

It was probably all part of her strategy.

However, Inokuma was simply too fast for her.

175
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,770
Inokuma!

176
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,240
This is why you're my fated rival!

177
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,840
You showed your amazing Ippon Zeoi at the very last minute!

178
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,500
Was that part of your grand strategy?

179
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,800
Geez, Matsuda!

180
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,260
Inokuma-san!

181
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,130
Why didn't you come sooner?

182
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,260
Yeah, why?


183
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,970
She wouldn't have had such a hard time if you'd been here!

184
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,490
Hold on. I did want to come sooner.

185
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,760
But my dad got sick, my plane landed in some random, far-off place, and I had a flat tire.

186
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,210
Why did my absence cause her a hard time?



187
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,700
It's guys like you who make her suffer!

188
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,200
It's because you weren't here that Inokuma-san...

189
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,710
I just remembered! She has a huge fan even here in Yugoslavia!

190
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,280
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have made it here at all.

191
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,210
Mister? Where are you, Mister?

192
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,720
Matsuda-san!

193
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,710
Yawara-san!

194
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,100
There's someone I want you to meet.

195
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,560
Come with me!

196
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
U-Um...

197
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,020
Hey, wait!

198
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,520
Um...

199
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,030
Eyecatch

200
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,110
Are you okay, Khrushchev?

201
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,450
Y-Yeah.

202
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,420
I see you finally understand how terrifying Yawara is.

203
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,240
I'm the only one who's an even match for her.

204
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,670
We will now begin the women's open-weight championship match.

205
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,730
That's no way to park.

206
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,680
I haven't seen you around these parts, old man.

207
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,240
Oh, I came from Zagreb.


208
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,240
Zagreb? That's quite a long way from here.

209
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,160
You must've earned a pretty penny for that trip!

210
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,200
Nah.

211
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,370
I ain't taking a dime from him.

212
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,200
Oh? Why not?

213
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,170
Because he gave these sore eyes a chance to see a rare and beautiful scene.

214
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,690
Where did you go?!

215
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,810
Mister.

216
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,080
That old man...

217
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,750
was a big fan of yours.

218
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,860
Isn't that amazing? Even in this faraway country, you have fans.




219
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,630
Ever since I first saw you, back when you threw that purse snatcher,

220
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,100
you've excited people all over the world with your judo!




221
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,940
I wanted to show that old man more of your matches!

222
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,810
You must've won big in your other matches, right?

223
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,890
From the first round on, you've been getting Ippon after Ippon!

224
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,450
All to roaring cheers!

225
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,460
Just thinking about it pumps me up!

226
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,240
H-Hey! What's wrong?

227
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
H-Hey.

228
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,400
What is it?

229
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,740
Don't cry.

230
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,410
We're moving right along with the women's open-weight final!

231
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,980
Here at Pioneer Hall, everyone's still excited over Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi.

232
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,380
What kind of match will we see here now?

233
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,730
Be strong, Kristin-san!


234
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,430
She'll get revenge for you.

235
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,140
Then she'll fight you one day.

236
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,690
She'll defeat Yawara someday too.

237
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,120
That's what Kristin said.

238
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,480
I'm also fired up from seeing Yawara in action!

239
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,410
Next time, I'm going to fight Yawara for real!

240
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,640
Everybody's scary!

241
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,780
Hajime!


242
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,660
Yawara!

243
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,040
Yawara!

244
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,040
Here. Wipe your tears.

245
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,680
O-Oh, don't worry. I always wipe my hands on my pants after using the bathroom.

246
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,050
It's a clean handkerchief.

247
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,280
Thanks.

248
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,560
I-I'm not sure what's going on, but don't cry.

249
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,580
Matsuda-san, I...

250
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,710
Y-You can use that to blow your nose.

251
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,120
Uh, you should wash the handkerchief.

252
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,240
I may not have a pencil this time...

253
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,030
but seeing you now takes me back.

254
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,920
Remember your MWJC entrance exam?

255
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,560
You hurt your hand and couldn't hold a pencil.


256
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,140
I tied a pencil to your hand like this.

257
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,650
I guess I forgot about it.
 That was two years ago, right?

258
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,060
That should do it.

259
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,340
Just kidding.

260
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,450
Matsuda-san.

261
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,790
Matsuda-san!

262
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,460
So this is where a third-rate reporter catches you?

263
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,700
Grandpa!

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
J-Jigoro-san!

265
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,750
C'mon, let's go!

266
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,170
Some first-rate TV and newspaper people are waiting for you!

267
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,540
Wait, Grandpa!
Some first-rate TV and newspaper people are waiting for you!

268
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,670
Geez!

269
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,690
You actually came, Kosaku?!

270
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,010
What do you mean by "actually"?

271
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,190
Gosh! I was this close to crushing Yawara-chan for good!

272
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,700
Oh yeah, you're missing an amazing match! Teleshikova's in the open-weight final!

273
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,060
Teleshikova?

274
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,230
Wait, how did Fujiko-san do?



275
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,160
I'm whipping her into shape.

276
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,170
What? So Fujiko-san lost to Teleshikova?

277
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,970
Who's her opponent for the final?

278
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,300
Do your own job!

279
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,170
I don't know!

280
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,180
Quit standing around! Have you kept in touch with the editorial desk?

281
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,590
Mm-hmm!

282
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,270
I missed you, Kosaku!

283
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,350
Don't grab me!
I missed you, Kosaku!

284
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,280
Let's go. We'll get that gold medal, then eat.

285
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,820
O-Okay.

286
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,100
However, Yawara,

287
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,610
except for the last one, your matches were the worst garbage I've ever seen!

288
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,730
If you pull that kind of judo again, you'll be sorry!

289
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,830
Are you listening, Yawara?!

290
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,080
Mm-hmm!

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,960
N-No way.</i>

292
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,800
Because Matsuda-san came, she broke out of her slump and won with that Ippon Zeoi.</i>

293
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,840

Yay!

301
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,830
We also have the results from the open-weight championship match!

Teleshikova's Ura Nage beat Canada's Kristin.


303
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,980
But Inokuma Yawara's Ippon Zeoi had fired both of them up, and they played a fierce match!

304
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,800
I can't wait to see those two in action again!



305
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,340
Anyway, I'm rushing to put a report together.

306
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,540
I'll fax it to you ASAP.

This is Inokuma Yawara we're talking about!

309
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,770
Of course she'd be awesome!

00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,360
A gold medal? How lucky...

311
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,020
Yes, good work! Just get it here quick!
A gold medal? How lucky...

312
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,430
Then hurry back home. We need more people here!

313
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,790
What?

314
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,320
You'll be late coming back because you're going to look for someone in Zagreb?

Don't say that while walking around wearing two of them!
