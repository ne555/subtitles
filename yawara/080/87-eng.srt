Inokuma fails yet again to get an Ippon!

2
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,530
The judge's decision gives her a narrow victory, thanks to her two Yukos!

3
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,870
Un! Deux! Trois!

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,540
Ippon! Done!

5
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,030
Ito's done it again! This time with an Uchi Mata!

6
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,430
Her first two matches might've been polar opposites, but she's the real deal, folks!

7
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,550
She's that good!

Yes, Ito's up against Teleshikova in the semifinals!

Inokuma-san, cheer up! I'm sure Matsuda-san is rooting for you!

So, come on!

14
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,500
Yeah.

I see, that's Inokuma Yawara for you.

You can be sure her engine's running at full throttle.

Good! Now we can relax.

24
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,270
There's no way Yawara-chan would be off her game!

25
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,440
You're wrong, Chief!

26
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,730
Fujiko-san is the one at the top of her game.

27
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,530
Ito's at the top of her game, not Inokuma?

28

That's right!

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,390
It gave me the tingles seeing her beat her opponents left and right.

30
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,920
Like her, uh, what was it again? Um...

31
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,880
Oh yeah, her Omata Gari!

Don't you mean her Ouchi Gari?

So... So is Fujiko-san winning with her Ouchi Gari?

35
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,020
Of course she is! She's winning!

Inokuma's out of the question?

I'm not sure what's going on with her,

51

but she's struggling for her victories.

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,780
Wh-What happened to you, Yawara-chan?

53
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,500
Is she injured?

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,900
Did she eat something that upset her stomach?


55
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,070
Maybe she partied too hard.

56
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,080
Damn it!

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,380
Inokuma, hang in there!

58
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,160
I-It's all right. She still has Fujiko-san, who's doing spectacularly.

59
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,620
Oh, Fujiko-san's winning streak is about to end.

60
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,610
Huh, why's that?

61
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,920
Kuni-chan, you're pretty confident for someone who knows nothing about judo.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,260
Oh, even I can predict the outcome, given the facts.

63
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,390
That's because Fujiko-san's next opponent is...

64
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,770
Wh-What is it?

65
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,390
What's going on, Mr. Editor?

66
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,070
Ito's opponent for the semis is...

67
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,400
Teleshikova.



68
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,510
What? Is she good?

69
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,080
Look, Ito.

70
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,250
Please listen carefully to what we have to say.

71
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,180
Wait, this needs to come from you, Coach.

72
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,730
Um, well...

73
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,970
Look, Fujiko! Brace yourself!

74
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,250
Go ahead, Coach! 

75
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,260
Fine, I'll do it.

76
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,240
We can't have you finding out right before the match and then fainting on us.

77
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,220
Uh... well, let's see here...

78
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,370
Ito, you've done really well in this year's World Championships.

79
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,330
And... because of that...

80
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,090
Well, you see... about your semifinal opponent...

81
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,680
Right, it's Teleshikova-san, isn't it?

82
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,760
You knew?

83
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,770
Yes, Master Jigoro just told me.

84
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,070
I see! So you've already fainted!



85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,060
Well, well...

86
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,150
If a man needs to say something, he says it.

87
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,070
Very impressive, Master Jigoro.

88
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,340
Actually, the fact that I got this far is almost too good to be true.

89
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,080
I'll lose whoever my opponent is.

90
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,480
Besides, Teleshikova-san fought evenly against Inokuma-san.

91
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm absolutely no match for her.



92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,870
What's more important is that I don't become a liability for Inokuma-san.

93
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,650
You call that pulling?!

94
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,520
Your turns are too slow! You're slacking off!

95
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,100
Honestly!

96
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,360
Oh, Master. Master.

97
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,350
Ito's giving up on the match because she's facing Teleshikova.

98
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,660
Hm, that might actually be good for us.

99
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,460
Really? I think so too!



100
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,980
I've wanted to see her this relaxed.

101
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,560
So does that mean both Inokuma and Ito are going to the finals?

102
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,200
Nope, ain't gonna happen.

103
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,980
Yeah, you're right. Ito beating Teleshikova?

104
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,600
Nope, the one on the bubble is Yawara.

105
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,050
I'd say that girl's in critical condition.

106
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,960
Inokuma-san.


107
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,960
Come on. It's almost time, Teleshikova.

108
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,180
Your opponent is Jigoro Inokuma's disciple.

109
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,920
Don't take her lightly.

110
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,320
Fujiko Ito, you say?</i>

111
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,920
That flea!

112
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,310
Why didn't Yawara Inokuma enter the open-weights?


113
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,930
Why do I have to fight that nobody?

114
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:36,180
We will now begin the semifinal match for the 48kg-and-under weight class!

115
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,870
See you, Fujiko-san. I'm off.


116
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,920
Be strong, Inokuma-san.

117
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,890
Good luck to you too, Fujiko-san.

118
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,800
Even if you are facing Teleshikova, I know you can win.

119
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:58,200
Listen, beat Teleshikova before she picks up on your "un, deux, trois" rhythm.

120
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,180
Before she picks up on my rhythm?

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,370
Always strike first.



122
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,030
If you do that, you'll win!

123
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,620
Inokuma-san. You're...

124
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,560
You're the one who's hurting,
 yet you're still concerned about me?

125
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,560
Don't worry, Inokuma-san.

126
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,050
I know Matsuda-san is watching you.

127
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,290
H-Hold on!

128
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,220
This is too fast!

129
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,560
Yawara is waiting.

130
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,600
Eyes on the road! The road!

131
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,190
It's now the semifinals for the 48kg-and-unders!

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,630
This is Japan's Inokuma.
 She's struggled all the way here.

133
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,210
Now would be a good time to show us her usual talents.

134
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,370
Facing her is the Dutch newcomer, Van Dorssen.

135
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,450
Inokuma-san, hang in there!

136
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,270
Yawara, do your best.


137
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,730
Remember, I'm here for you, Yawara-san!

138
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,440
Hajime!

139
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,480
Yes, get her!

140
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,700
You can score an Ippon Zeoi on her in a second!

141
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,910
That's Van Dorssen from the Netherlands.

142
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,590
She got lucky with her previous draws, so here she is in the semis.

143
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,830
However, she's not supposed to be a match for Inokuma.

144
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,910
You're right about that. I really want to see Inokuma return to her usual form.

145
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,710
Oh!



146
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,860
Here we have Ito making her appearance in the neighboring ring!

147
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,720
The semifinals for the open-weights are also starting!

148
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,440
And facing Ito is...

149
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,900
Yes, it's the Soviet bruiser, Teleshikova!

150
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,530
Yawara Inokuma.</i>

151
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,470
What are you doing over there?</i>

152
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,200
What are you doing?</i>

153
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,260
Bow!


154
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,310
We have now reached the do or die moment of the World Judo Championships!

155
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,180
Hajime!

156
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,100
Flea!</i>

157
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,890
Get lost!</i>


158
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,920
She seems somewhat different than usual.

159
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,230
That's because she's fighting against Teleshikova.

160
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,950
She's relaxed because she's resigned to a loss.

161
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,410
No. The one who's different is Teleshikova.

162
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,790
Oh, Yawara!

163
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,290
There goes Inokuma!

164
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,750
Waza Ari!

165
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,040
So close! Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi netted her a Waza Ari!

166
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,630
That should've been an easy Ippon for her, though.

167
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,840
Now Inokuma's going for an Osaekomi!

168
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,590
Yes, get her!

169
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,350
Hm, piffle.

170
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,660
Osaekomi!

171
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,700
Inokuma's pinning her!

172
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,350
Since she's already got a Waza Ari,

173
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,860
a 25 second pin will earn her an Awasewaza Ippon! 

174
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,860
Fujiko-san!






175
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,200
Fujiko-san! Always attack first!

176
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,660
Inokuma-san?</i>

177
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,980
Attack... first?</i>

178
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Mm-hmm!

179
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,880
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

180
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Un! Deux! Trois!</i>

181
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Un! Deux! Trois!</i>

182
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,760
Un! Deux! Trois!</i>

183
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,020
All right!

184
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,860
All right!

185
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,370
She's got it!

186
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,450
She wo—

187
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,790
Waza Ari!

188
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,040
She's done it!

189
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,090
You idiot! That follow-through was weak!

190
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,800
You're supposed to do this, remember? This, dangit!

191
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,480
Whoa! Teleshikova, who just suffered a Waza Ari, is going for an Osaekomi!

192
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,060
Get away, Fujiko-san!

193
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,060
Stop!

194
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,430
Mate! Jougai!

195
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,100
Man, that was close! Ito is spared!

196
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,130
Teleshikova had completely let her guard down.

197
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,250
This is her first time facing Ito, her unique timing, and her Ouchi Gari.

198
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,090
But even at that...

199
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,660
That's right!

200
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,810
The complete newcomer Fujiko got a Waza Ari off <i>the</i> Teleshikova!



201
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,600
Ito, we need you to keep up that momentum!

202
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,850
Hajime!

203
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,360
Ippon! Done!

204
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,070
Fujiko-san! Attack first!

205
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,740
Get her before she gets a read on your rhythm!

206
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,640
Fujiko-san!

207
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,290
Ippon! Done!

208
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,780
Oh! In the next ring, Inokuma gets an Awasewaza Ippon,

209
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,090
thanks to her Yoko Shihoh Gatame and her Ippon Zeoi Waza Ari!





210
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,220
Inokuma Yawara is going to the finals!

211
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,320
But she seemed to be too busy cheering for Ito to notice her own Ippon.

212
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,170
Fujiko-san?

213
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,440
Bow!

214
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,380
Attack her now, Fujiko-san!

215
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,330
Sorry!

216
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,450
Yawara Inokuma.</i>

217
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,110
It appears you've somehow made it to the finals.</i>

218
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
But you're no match for me.</i>

219
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,220
Teleshikova, quit being distracted by Yawara</i>

220
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,930
and focus on the opponent in front of you.</i>

221
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,890
Hurry! Hurry and attack her!

222
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,650
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

223
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,320
Fujiko-san, now!

224
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,070
Un, deux...!

225
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,820
It's Ito with an Ouchi Gari!
 Teleshikova cautiously slouches forward!

226
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,200
Trois!

227
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,580
An Uchi Mata!

228
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,250
All right! The Nutcracker!

229
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,250
This time she's got it!

230
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,770
I can't believe you can sing while we're going so fast!

231
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,890
Damn!

232
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Where the hell are we?

233
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,100
How far is it to Belgrade?

234
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
H-Hey, just a second!

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,570
Mister, stop! Stop!

236
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,570
Hey.

237
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,090
Hey!

238
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,280
I said stop, you Papara coot!

239
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,770
Yuko!

240
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,980
Fujiko-san?

241
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,370
Versus Teleshikova?

242
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,660
Fujiko-san's in the open-weights?!

243
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,940
And she got a Yuko off Teleshikova?!

244
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
Impossible...

245
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,920
That's Khrushchev.

246
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,380
They're doing the 48kg-and-unders in the next ring.

247
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,680
"Semifinals"? It's already the semis?

248
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,360
What a wicked Ura Nage!
 It looked just like Teleshikova's!

249
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,150
Yawara-san!

250
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,670
Is she winning her matches?

251
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,450
Is she going to face Khrushchev in the finals?

252
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,280
Fujiko-san's still going!

253
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,710
Oh my God, she got a Yuko and a Waza Ari off Teleshikova.

254
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,830
Is this for real? You can do it—

255
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,640
Hurry up!

256
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,590
H-Hey, give me a minute!

257
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,720
Yawara-san?

258
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,010
Oh, Yawara!

259
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,200
Hurry up!

260
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,850
Hey, w-wait!



261
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,830
Ask those guys if Yawara-san is winning!

262
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,820
No, no! Hurry up!

263
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,530
Yawara-san, you're winning, right?

264
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,010
Right?!

265
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,670
Things are at a fever pitch here in Belgrade's Pioneer Hall.

266
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,660
We're seeing something completely unexpected.

267
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,470
It's the open-weight semifinals.

268
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,630
The Japanese freshman and underdog Ito Fujiko is putting up a really, really good fight!

269
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,940
Teleshikova forcefully lifts her up!

270
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,650
Jougai! Mate!

271
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,950
Fujiko-san!

272
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,980
Yawara Inokuma...</i>

273
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,330
Master!

274
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,620
Ito Fujiko-san is pulling off the unexpected!



275
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,840
Of course she is! I trained her!

276
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,310
Fujiko is certainly amazing, but that's not all.

277
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,080
Teleshikova has completely lost her usual composure.

278
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,270
It's like she's a different person from the one I fought.

279
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,310
Yeah, you're right.

280
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,430
What's with you, Teleshikova? Maintain your cool!

281
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,150
She's still angry that she won't get to fight Yawara Inokuma.

282
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,990
Even a precision machine like Teleshikova loses her cool when it comes to Yawara!

283
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,210
Fujiko-san, you can do it! You can win!

284
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,750
Inokuma-san... I...</i>

285
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,010

I wonder how Fujiko is doing?



288
00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:00,020
Yeah. The sports news said that they suddenly entered Fujiko in the open-weight matches,

289
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,410
so we'll just have to wait for the delayed footage tomorrow.

290
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,910
She must be in a match right now.

291
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,910
Yeah. But she's still our Fujiko-chan.

292
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,860
Yes, she is.

293
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,680
That girl will never win first place.



294
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,030
Yes, now just run out the clock!

295
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,850
Even so, Teleshikova isn't an easy person to evade.

296
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,680
Joe-day is right.

297
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,810
Besides, I don't teach evasive judo.

298
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,150
You snuff out your opponent with an Ippon!

Hey, you're spilling the tea!

Oh my! Sorry, forgive me.

301
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,660
Honestly, we can't have you spacing out.

302
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,130
A good luck stalk!

303
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,060
Oh my!

304
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,360
Maybe...

305
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
Just maybe...


306
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,290
Mm-hmm. Just maybe.
