1
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,900
Inokuma Yawara finally makes her appearance!

2
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,560
Everyone in Japan has been waiting for this.

3
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,140
Even the world must have been waiting for this.

4
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,660
Inokuma Yawara has appeared in the 48kg-and-unders!

5
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,410
Inokuma's first opponent is the freshman player from France, Deneuve.

6
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,880
Just based on their records, is this Inokuma's game to lose?

7
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,170
Hajime!

8
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:08,230
Swan Lake on the World Stage

9
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,700
Hey, what is this? You ain't even gonna throw a teddy bear this way!

10
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,720
Y-Yes, sir!

11
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,620
Un, deux, trois!




12
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,080
Hey, what are you trying to pull?

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,580
All right, you're up, Kristin. I'll leave this year's open-weights to you.

14
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,060
Okay, Jody.

15
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,590
If you'll excuse me, I'll go see how Yawara's doing in the first round.

16
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,590
Inokuma-san, did you win?



17
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,220
That's my Yawara! She won the match immediately!


18
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,440
Yawara...

19
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,900
Waza Ari!

20
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,850
What's going on here?!

21
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,860
Inokuma, <i>the</i> Inokuma, suffers a Waza Ari from Deneuve's Uchi Mata!

22
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,540
That dingbat!

23
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,500
No way.

24
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,260
Mate!


25
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,470
Inokuma literally claws her way out of a hold!

26
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,230
However, who could have foreseen Inokuma's performance today?

27
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,970
Yamashita-san?

28
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,590
Yes, you're not kidding.

29
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,940
But now that we're seeing it with fresh eyes, look!

30
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,970
Inokuma's usual speed is gone!

31
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,570
Inokuma-san!

32
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,570
Get it together, Inokuma!

33
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,450
Yawara-san.

34
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,290
Yawara, what's wrong?

35
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,390
She's right.</i>

36
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,770
What's wrong?!</i>

37
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,130
What's going on? What's wrong with me?</i>

38
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,510
There it is!

39
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,010
She can do it!

40
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,510
Inokuma's Ippon Zeoi!

41
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,220
She got it!

42
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,890
No, wait!

43
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,390
Waza Ari!

44
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,310
I-It's a Waza Ari!

45
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,650
If that had been the Inokuma we've known, she would've scored an Ippon!

46
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,360
What's wrong, Inokuma?!

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,610
That lousy, half-witted bubblehead!

48
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,060
Hey, enough of your "parara-papas" and step on it!

49
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,020
It's gonna take us four hours to reach Belgrade even if you do 100 km per hour!

50
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,660
This is hopeless.



51
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,310
He's already happy enough taking a passenger on a long trip.

52
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,570
But I'll make it, no matter what it takes.

53
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,000
Hold on, Yawara-san.

54
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,070
Inokuma Yawara's in a tough fight!

55
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,810
Although she took back the Waza Ari,

56
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,850
she's lost the initiative to the French newcomer, Deneuve!

57
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,610
You twit! What's this lily-livered judo?!

58
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,750
What's wrong, Inokuma?!

59
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,370
What happened to the energy you used to flip me?!

60
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,080
She tries another Ippon Zeoi!

61
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,540
Yes, she's got it!



62
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,710
Yuko!

63
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,960
A...

64
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,470
Yuko!

65
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,930
You're a danged disgrace!

66
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,650
Well, at least she's leading by a Yuko.

67
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,440
But Inokuma's not out of the woods just yet.

68
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,610
Still 30 seconds left!

69
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,830
I-Inokuma-san...</i>

70
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,470
E-Even the Inokuma-san is fighting for her life?</i>

71
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,230
I know not having Matsuda-san around has made her too discouraged</i>

72
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,340
and nervous to play normally, but...</i>

73
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,550
The World Championships really are an awful venue!

74
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,950
Only ten seconds left!

75
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,760
Can Inokuma maintain her Yuko lead?!

76
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,850
Deneuve catches Inokuma with a Hane Goshi! 

77
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,210
Watch out, Inokuma! Watch out!

78
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,080
Don't let her! 
Watch out, Inokuma! Watch out!

79
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,900
Don't let her! 

80
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,450
Done!

81
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,400
She held on!

82
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,560
Inokuma won the first round by holding on to a one Yuko lead!

83
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,570
Boy, that was close!

84
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,400
But it's unlike Inokuma to win this way, Yamashita-san.

85
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,450
Yes. As far as I know, this is her first win without getting an Ippon.

86
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,820
What's going on? Is Inokuma injured?



87
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,790
You giant pinhead! What in blazes were you doing in that match?

88
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,130
Master Jigoro!

89
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,820
Hey, Yawara, are you listening?!


90
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,960
Sit your fanny right here, dang it!

91
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Hey, get back here!

92
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,980
Yawara...</i>

93
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,140
So that's Yawara?

94
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,100
So that's the judo that has you so worked up, Teleshikova?

95
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,560
If that's what she's got, she won't stand a chance against me.

96
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,180
That's not Yawara.

97
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,570
Ito! Hey, Ito!

98
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,850
There you are!

99
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,030
Hey, Ito! You're almost up!

100
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,330
Come on. You'll forfeit if you don't move it!

101
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,590
I-I'll take that forfeit!

102
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,650
Don't be stupid!


103
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,980
Come on. Let's go!

104
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,180
Yawara-san! Yawara-san!

105
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,430
Oh, are you here?

106
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,330
The Yawara-san I know wasn't the one who just played.

107
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,010
Were you a little nervous?

108
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,400
But don't worry. I'm here for you.

109
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,150
This is the women's locker room!

110
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,780
Oh, pardon me.

111
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,570
Huh?

112
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,150
B-But still, Yawara-san needs me!

113
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,330
Open up! She needs me!

114
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,090
Impossible. Matsuda-san is really on Yawara-san's...

115
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,850
Th-That can't be.

116
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,010
It's not possible, not in the least.

117
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,810
Yawara?

118
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,980
What's wrong, Yawara?

119
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,830
I don't know.

120
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,990
This has never happened before.

121
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,610
I'm scared!

122
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,660
Mister.

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,950
Please, please go faster!

124
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,730
I beg you!

125
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,220
Loosen up those shoulders! Relax!

126
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,250
Clear your head. Don't think about anything!

127
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,080
I wanna go back to Japan!

128
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,720
U-Um, is she going to be my opponent?

129
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,460
Even Jody-san would've been better!

130
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,710
B-But it's that Cuban, Martinez-san?!

131
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,980
Hey, hold on!

132
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,020
H-Hey! Get it together, Ito!

133
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,110
We can't have you losing your legs before the match!

134
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,220
We'll, we're all worried about Inokuma Yawara,

135
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,050
but the open-weight tournament is about to begin in Ring B.

136
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,790
Yes, with Ito Fujiko.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
Ito Fujiko came with the national team as a training player

138
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,530
but was suddenly picked for this huge role as a regular competitor.

139
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,130
But her first opponent is Martinez, the 72 kg plus heavyweight

140
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,050
who was evenly matched with Canada's Rockwell, so she's out of luck!

141
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,430
Bow!

142
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,020
I... I can't!</i>

143
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,320
I can't!</i>

144
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,220
I just can't!</i>

145
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,610
Hajime!





146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,020
She tossed her out with just one arm!

147
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,000
Japan's sent out another turkey!

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,240
I guess it's hopeless.

149
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,010
I shouldn't have put her in!

150
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,060
Geez! Losers, all of them!

We will be showing video footage of the match at 4 PM tomorrow.

174
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,230
Martinez with an Uchi Mata!

175
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,370
Yuko!

176
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,330
It's a Yuko! Martinez gets yet another Yuko on Ito!

177
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,300
It's the first round of the open-weight matches!

178
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,830
Japan's Ito Fujiko can't pull off a single move against Cuba's Martinez!

179
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,050
She's now down two Yuko, three Koka, and she even has a Shido against her!

180
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,800
Ito has yet to score a single point!

181
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,010
I can't do this!</i>

182
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,860
This is supposed to be the World Championship open-weight matches,</i>

183
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,820
yet I'm facing this small fry instead of Inokuma Yawara or Jody Rockwell?</i>

184
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,110
What are you doing, Ito-san?!

185
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,870
Turn it around. I don't care how!

186
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,210
Forget it.






187
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,490
She's can't even pull off a fluke, let alone a move!

188
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,040
Master Inokuma...

189
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,000
Master, you're eating the shells along with the peanuts!

190
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,780
M-Morons! I'm getting pathetic matches from danged morons!

191
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,730
It's Martinez with a Harai Goshi!


192
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,230
Ito Fujiko's done for!

193
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,240
Please, stay in it!

194
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,240
Waza Ari!

195
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,350
Mate!

196
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,750
Ito has now given up a Waza Ari!

197
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,080
Still, Ito narrowly escaped an Ippon.

198
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,230
Yes, the way her hips are out of position makes it very hard to execute a move on her.

199
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,400
But there's no way she's going to win if she maintains that posture.

200
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,300
Martinez attacks tenaciously!

201
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,710
Ito's completely on the defensive!


202
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,000
Yawara, everyone gets scared during a match.

203
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,530
Even I get really scared.

204
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:42,380
However, you've been so focused on your matches that the thought has never crossed your mind.

205
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,540
But that focus is gone, isn't it?

206
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,040
There's no point in you competing if that's the case.

207
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,030
That's why I let Kristin enter the open-weights in my place.

208
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:58,950
In any case, Fujiko entered the open-weights, not you.

209
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,020
Fujiko-san?

210
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
That's right, Fujiko-san is playing right now!

211
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,270
Yawara! This is no time to be worrying about others!

212
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,280
Is that Martinez with an Osaekomi? Ito's in trouble!

213
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,030
Fujiko-san?

214
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,460
Dammit! What is this TV doing?!

215
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,080
How's Fujiko-san doing?! Show me the broadcast!

216
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,270
Move it! We can't see the TV!

217
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,170
Hanazono-san, you have a call!

218
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:35,720
Huh?

219
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,340
Wh-Who is it?

220
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,770
A woman.

221
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,120
How'd you get a girl with <i>that</i> for a face?






222
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,770
You've been hitting on other women besides Inokuma Yawara and Ito Fujiko?!

223
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,440
H-Hello?

224
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,380
Hanazono-kun? It's me, Paddyfield!

225
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,920
Did you see the news about Fujiko-san?

226
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,860
Oh, Paddyfield. Yes, I did.


227
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,700
Hook us up, will you?!

228
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,800
They must be having their match over there right now.

229
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,830
I'm not worried about Inokuma-san, but they put Fujiko-san in!

230
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,930
What'll we do?

231
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,970
Th-There's nothing we can do until we see the footage tomorrow!



232
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,300
Can't we find out what's going on now from our judo connections?

233
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,740
Let's have a group date!

234
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,340
We're the Ebitendo U Judo Team! Pleased to meet you!

235
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,230
Ah! Matsuda-san!

236
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,730
Oh yeah! From <i>All Sports News</i> !

237
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,270
Yes, that's right!

238
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,130
Matsuda-san must be giving <i>All Sports News</i> live updates from the scene.

239
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,740
We're all cool dudes here!

240
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,240
Got it! I'll call Kyonkyon, Marilyn, and Sayuri!

241
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,090
So you're hooking us up with a Kyonkyon and Marilyn?

242
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,240
I'll be taking Sayuri-san!

243
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,890
That's right. Matsuda-san is there!

244
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,720
I'll also take that Matsuda-san!

245
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,720
Come on, can't you hit the gas?
 You're gonna make me miss the semis!

246
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,480
I'm begging you, Mister, please!

247
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,330
Wh-What are those zeros on the meter?

248
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,800
Y-You're not saying...

249
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,830
One, ten, hundred, thousand, 10,000... 100,000...

250
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,100
11,230,000 dinara!

251
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,550
No way. H-He wouldn't dare.

252
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,880
So, Mister...</i>

253
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,220
You're not some evil taxi driver with a friendly face, are you?</i>

254
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,270
What the hell's the exchange rate of the yen to the dinar?</i>

255
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,230
Yuko!

256
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,600
Another Yuko!

257
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,510
That's her third Yuko and Ito Fujiko's on the ropes!

258
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,580
Only 30 seconds left!

259
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,140
Come on, just let her win!

260
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,580
She's got all the points on the scoreboard!

261
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,090
I should've competed instead, despite my injury!

262
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,470
C-Come on. This ain't over by a long shot.

263
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,220
R-Right, Master Inokuma?

264
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,260
You lousy boob! I'm done with you!

265
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,270
You can't be... Didn't you recommend her?

266
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Mate!

267
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,110
I'm done.

268
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm dying!




269
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,690
This is the internationals.
 I'm not even supposed to be here!

270
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,020
Fujiko-san!

271
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,750
Fujiko-san, get it together!

272
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,290
Inokuma-san! But you were so out of it!</i>

273
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,300
Remember your training!
 Remember your "un, deux, trois"!

274
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,260
Inokuma-san is concerned about me.</i>

275
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,800
Come on! Come on!

276
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,920
I'm sorry. I'm...</i>

277
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,690
I'm... always holding you back, Inokuma-san.</i>

278
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,930
Hajime!

279
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,950
Just twenty seconds left, folks!

280
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,560
Come on!

281
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,130
Martinez is beckoning the clearly unwilling Ito to take her on!

282
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,800
You'll be sorry if you take her challenge!

283
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,700
Fujiko-san!

284
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,410
I admit it.</i>

285
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,440
I'm a total failure.</i>


286
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,710
But at least I need to cheer up Inokuma-san by having her see me give it my all!</i>

287
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,630
Hey, hey! What's this? What's this?

288
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,380
Un, deux, trois... Un, deux, trois...</i>

289
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,470
Ito makes a last ditch run at her! Will we see a miracle here?!

290
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,680
No, wait! Hold on a second!

291
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
Un, deux, trois.</i>

292
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,060
Un, deux, trois.</i>

293
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,570
Fujiko-san?

294
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,070
Un!

295
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,320
Deux!

296
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Trois!

297
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,080
Ippon!

298
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,220
She did it!

299
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,050
Fujiko!

300
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,110
Wh-What a huge comeback!

301
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,980
Her Ouchi Gari strikes again!

302
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,050
Ito comes back with an Ippon win!

303
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,490
No way!

304
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,330
That's it! That was what I was waiting for!

305
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,020
She did it! You made a fine choice!

306
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,900
Of course I did!

307
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,340
But she should've defeated her opponent right off the bat!

308
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,350
The way she took her time out there makes me worry about her future!

309
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,530
Stupid people!

310
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,070
Inokuma-san!

311
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,230
Fujiko-san!

312
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,590
I won!

313
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,590
You're amazing, Fujiko!

314
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,500
Yawara. Fujiko did her best, so you should too.

315
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,150
Yeah.

316
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,470
Ippon!

317
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,570
Teleshikova does a quick Ura Nage!

318
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,020
An Ippon in no time flat!

319
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,850
Wait!

320
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,820
And in the 48kg-and-under ring,
 Khrushchev gets an Ura Nage Ippon!

321
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,410
You can call her Teleshikova-lite! Such force!

322
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,830
The Soviets unleash a pair of overwhelming wins!

323
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,250
It's like they're directly challenging Japan's Inokuma and Ito!

325
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,350
I'm glad Fujiko-san won!

326
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,480
Whaddaya mean, "You're glad she won"?!

327
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,000
She had way too much trouble with that Manekineko girl!

328
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,650
In any case, how in damnation do you explain <i>your</i> match?!

329
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,370
I swear, what's happened to me? I don't get it.

330
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,890
Now, Yawara, next time you're winning in five, three, no, one second!

331
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,120
