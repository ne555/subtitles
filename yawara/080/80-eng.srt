00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
Inokuma-san! Inokuma-san!

2
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,490
Are you there, Inokuma Yawara-san?

3
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,540
Can we get a comment? Hey, Yawara-san!

4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,690
Good morning, you fine gentlemen!

5
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,390
You're Going to the World Championships!

6
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,930
Oh, it's just Jigoro-san.

7
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,390
Whaddaya mean "just"?

8
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,320
But I can see why all you reporters are flooding this place.

9
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,260
Yawara won the All-Japan Selected Tournament yesterday

10
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,400
and is going to the World Championships!

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,740
You can't think up a better article than that!

12
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,390
I'll answer any questions you want. Go ahead, ask anything.

13
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,580
U-Um, well...

14
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,410
Uh, actually...

15
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,590
we're here for something bigger than her victory.

16
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,380
Have you seen the morning sports papers?

17
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,870
Headlines: Struggle! We Want Yawara-chan!
Three Companies Make Claims on Hotly Pursued Yawara#

18
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,120
Look, they're spilling a lot of ink about Yawara-san's job prospects.

Look, they're spilling a lot of ink about Yawara-san's job prospects.

22
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,850
In any case, Oshiuri Travels, Ginza Can-Can,

23
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,420
and Mini House all claimed Yawara for themselves at yesterday's tournament.

24
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,590
Newspapers add so much color these days that it hurts my eyes.

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,920
I see <i>All Sports</i> is spreading unfounded rumors again.

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,950
Don't worry. My gut tells me I'm right!

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,880
You nitwit! Who the hell writes articles based on his gut or a bluff?

32
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,720
So where is Yawara-san going to work?

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,960
I've heard that Mini House is her top choice.

34
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,820
All righty, I think it's time to open up my clinic.

35
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,290
So you guys want a back rub or something?

36
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,430
Don't try to dodge the question!

37
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,150
Almost forgot. Please try these Amazing Monaka.

38
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,650
Please, at least give us a hint!

39
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,770
This is good. Where'd you buy it?

40
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,200
Isn't it? And you'll get some more if you just give us something.

41
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,420
Hah! Yawara ain't gonna be some trifling office lady!

42
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,710
She's going straight to Saikai U to play judo!

43
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,880
What did you say?

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,670
<i>All Sports</i> got us again!

45
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,660
Just imagine yourself as some office lady!

46
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,120
You'd just waste your hard-earned money on pointless entertainment and men!

47
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,290
Aw, man, the editor is going to flay me for this one!

48
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,680
Damn you, <i>All Sports News !</i>

49
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,250
It's off to MWJC!

50
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,450
Then Saikai U!




51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,020
She can fool around all she likes in the little time she has left at junior college.

52
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,660
Hey! Ain't you gonna listen to me talk?!

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,200
It might make a good story!

54
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,530
Matsuda-kun.

55
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,700
Yes, Chief?

56
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,820
You're a genius! So you really did scoop them, Matsuda-kun?

57
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,670
Y-Yeah.

58
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,570
An unflappable reporter who follows his instincts!

59
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,720
You're the very model of a journalist!

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,640
So she's going to continue her judo at Saikai U?</i>

61
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,700
Will it really play out that way?</i>

62
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,640

66
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,590
I-It can't be!

67
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,290
Fujiko-san? Fujiko-san?

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,420
Fujiko-san? Fujiko-san?!

69
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,300
Hello?

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,300
If you're looking for Ito-san, she left a while ago.

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,350
Thank you so much!

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,150
She must be thoroughly upset.</i>

73
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,840
She practiced her heart out for that tournament.</i>

74
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,140
She wanted to go to the World Championships in Yugoslavia so much.</i>

75
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,080
Oh yeah, I have my own problems to worry about.</i>

76
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,800
Sir, take a look at these!





77
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,300
The only one saying she's going to Saikai U is <i>All Sports News.</i>

78
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:17,810
Maybe we should have stayed and made a final play for her instead of withdrawing so quickly?

79
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,910
If Oshiuri gets her, we'll be in real trouble.

80
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,530
Geez, will you let it go?




81
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,070
Why would she come to us when we don't have a judo team?

82
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,290
Inokuma Yawara is going to Saikai University.

83
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,040
Then she'll be on top of the world as the greatest judoka.

84
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,180
Mr. President! Chief of General Affairs!

85
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,090
What is it? And knock at least!

86
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,550
I-I'm sincerely sorry.

87
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,050
This is h-huge! I-Ino... Inoku...

88
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,050
What?

89
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,060
We got a call from Inokuma Yawara! She's going to stop by here!

Ah, she must be furious.


94
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,820
We came gallivanting in to recruit her,
 even though we don't have a judo team!

95
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,100
What should we do?

96
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,780

We wish to apologize for what we did yesterday.

103
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,490
We congratulate you on your victory.

Oh, uh...

108
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:48,480
We're very sorry.

109
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,900
I'm very sorry.
We're very sorry.

110
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,370
Y-You came all the way to the arena yesterday, but I wasn't considerate to you.

111
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,870
N-No, we were the ones who tried to recruit you, despite our lack of a judo team.

112
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,510
Look, I know I was being very selfish.

113
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,880
We selfishly thought about how our earnings would double if we hired you.

114
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,380
Um, I wonder if it's too late?

115
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,140
Oh, Yutenji?

116
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,480
Did ya get a swarm of reporters?

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,260
Did they give you some Amazing Monaka?

118
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,150
What?

119
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,520
The Board of Trustees officially approved Ito Fujiko-san's admission,

120
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,510
along with Yawara-san's!

121
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,370
All they have to do is take a simple entrance exam!

122
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,620
Really? You did a bang-up job, Yutenji!

123
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,340
But I still need another favor from you about Beanpole.

124
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,670
To celebrate this little victory,

125
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,870
why don't I treat you to some hairy crab ramen at the Rai-Rai Ken?

126
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,880
You're gonna love it!

129
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,440
Yes. I know I've come too late.

130
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,410
But I wish to work for Tsurukame Travel—

131
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,360
I mean, for your esteemed company.

132
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,870
Perhaps it's out of the question.

133
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,970
It's absolutely not out of the question, Inokuma-san!

134
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,880
We implore you to join us!

135
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,880
But we still don't have a judo team.

136
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,380
I know!

137
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,670
But I still want to work for you.

138
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,390
Um, what about your transfer to Saikai University?

139
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,100
I have no intention of going to Saikai University.

140
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,850
But your grandfather was sure that you'd go to Saikai U.

141
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,110
Will there be problems?

142
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,960
It will be fine.

143
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,410
I'll straighten things out.
 I'll convince him otherwise.

144
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,370
Really?

145
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,010
Fujiko-san isn't picking up.</i>

146
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,250
What a mess.

147
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,950
I have to turn Grandpa around somehow.

148
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,250
Meanwhile, Fujiko-san is completely depressed.

149
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,950
I swear, it's all judo's fault!

150
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,610
You're wrong!

151
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,110
Judo is definitely the right path for you!

152
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,160
Hanazono-kun... and Fujiko-san?

153
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,060
But I always fail at the most important moments.

154
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,130
I mean, I promised Inokuma-san repeatedly that I'd go with her to Yugoslavia.

155
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,580
But during the critical championship match...

156
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,630
No matter what I did, I was just as pathetic as I've always been.

157
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,140
Now wait.

158
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,640
Even if I continue playing judo at Saikai U with Inokuma-san,

159
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,360
I'll just remain a failure.

160
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,150
I'm worried that I'll just be a burden to her.

161
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,650
You're wrong!

162
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,660
That simply doesn't apply to you, Fujiko-san!

163
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,120
Inokuma needs you, Fujiko-san!

164
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,030
Inokuma continues with judo because you're there for her!

165
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:37,630
And doesn't she see you as not just her friend, but as a real judoka?

166
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,630
I-Inokuma-san sees me like that?




167
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,490
But if you keep beating yourself up like you're doing now,

168
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,510
Inokuma will be crushed.

Look, I get it, Hanazono-san. So please don't cry.

171
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,780
I was stupid to get depressed over something like that.

Yes.

176
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,070
You're lucky to have someone to support you, Fujiko-san.

177
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,440
I guess I didn't need to worry after all.

You'll love what we're having tonight!

I'm not going!

Lying? What are you talking about?

222
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,390
You made a very public, very firm declaration yesterday!

223
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,400
You can do it! You can do it, Fujiko-san!

224
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,480
You said we'd go to Yugoslavia together, didn't you?

225
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,990
Declaration? That was just...

226
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,490
Don't tell me you forgot.



227
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,230
It was... just because Fujiko-san wanted to go so badly.

228
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,750
If Fujiko-san isn't going, then there's no point in me going either.

229
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,960
You can still go to Yugoslavia even if you ain't gonna play!

Listen, Yawara!

You're going to win the World Championship

This is Inokuma! Yawara's going to Saikai U, and that's final!

If you still have something to say, go ahead!

If that happens, we'll just call 'em back!

There ain't no calls for you to worry about! Now get in here and eat!

I've completely recovered!

259
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,490
Now I'm ready and primed for the Canadian Championships!

260
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,290
I thought I'd hear your voice before my matches,

261
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,500
but don't worry, I'll be sure to win, eh?

262
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,610
All right. See you again at the World Championships!

263
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,500
Give my regards to Master Jigoro! Bye-bye!

264
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,280
It was an international call from Jody!

Oh, Jody, huh?

266
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,470
I didn't get to talk to her because you turned on the answering machine.

267
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,880
Didn't you hear what Jody just said?



268
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,480
She's gonna meet you at the World Championships.

269
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,150
You don't need to do some drawn-out international call.

270
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,820
You can just meet her in Yugoslavia.

271
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,950
Now come on, time to eat!

272
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,040
That was great timing, Jody.</i>

In any case, I should go see her.

I haven't had a good talk with her in some time.

Yeah, that's what I'll do.

Geez, we never get any time alone lately, Kosaku!

Ah, it's that huge woman from the Seoul tournament!

I see. So she's fully healed!

296
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,290
She's competing in the World Championships? Good for you, Jody!

Even if Inokuma Yawara came to us herself,

306
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,150
there are still several hurdles we need to clear before we employ her.

307
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,110
Isn't that right, sir?

308
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,500
Yes.

309
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,460
However, despite all the celebratory fireworks Oshiuri and the other firms are firing off,

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,370
Tsurukame Travel is Inokuma Yawara's first choice.

Let's sit back and reel her in, gentlemen!

312
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,460
But I heard a rumor that Oshiuri is planning to take her on a world cruise,

313
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,050
making her into a captive audience.







314
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,560
In that case, we'll send her on two world cruises, or even three!

315
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,060
But you said all we had to do is sit back.

316
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,650
Then... Then what should we do?

317
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,280
Sir, you can relax!

318
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,280
She's going to a training camp to prepare for the World Championships.

319
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,780
Neither Oshiuri nor Mini House can get to her there.

320
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,220
That means we can't get to her either!

321
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,790
Oh yeah, there is that problem.

322
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,470
What are we going to do?





323
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,290
Sir...

324
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,300
The problem is that grandfather of hers.

325
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,300
Yes, her grandfather.

326
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,470
You have a call.

Nope, for Beanpole.

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,070
For me? Who could it be?

330
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,770

So you and Beanpole are gonna get me two gold medals!

But Fujiko-san says she's just a practice partner.

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,780
But you two are still playing judo in Yugoslavia.
