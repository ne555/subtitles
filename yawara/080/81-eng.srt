I've loved him.

I know it's what I want the most.

Yes. I know I've come too late.

21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,080
But I wish to work for Tsurukame Travelâ€”

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,960
I mean, for your esteemed company.

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,460
You gonna throw one of your hissyfits again!

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,010
You lying, no-account girl!

25
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,760
You made a very public, very firm declaration yesterday!

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,720
You can do it! You can do it, Fujiko-san!

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,810
You said we'd go to Yugoslavia together, didn't you?

28
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,590
Listen, Yawara!

29
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,930
You're going to win the World Championship

30
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,230
and go to Saikai University with Beanpole, and that's final!

31
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,990
I-Inokuma-san!

32
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:28,960
I... I... I've been chosen as a training player for the Yugoslavia World Championships!

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,000
All right!

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,460
I won't get to play in any matches,
 but I can still go to Yugoslavia with you!

35
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:44,470
Fujiko's First Training Camp!


36
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,660
This is a good night to celebrate.

37
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,210
After all, you're going to the World Championships with Yawara.

38
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,170
Yes!

39
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,430
Thank you very much for making this food for me!

40
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,520
Yes, eat up, Beanpole, while I eat <i>and</i> drink. 

41
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,020
Okay.

42
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,520
Let's have a toast, Inokuma-san!

43
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,610
Inokuma-san, I'm very moved by all this.

44
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,240
Fujiko-san, the truth is...

45
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,540
I'm not going to the World Championships.



46
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,040
What is it, Inokuma-san?

47
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,760
Oh, it's nothing.

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Hey, what gives? The sake will go stale!

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,840
Cheers!

50
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,750
Training camp will begin soon.

51
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,390
I have to build up my strength so that I won't hold Inokuma-san back!

52
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,520
Gosh, what am I supposed to say to Fujiko-san?

53
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,810
I'm not going to the World Championships, and I'm not going to training camp either.



54
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,290
You're going to be a training player for the World Championships?

55
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,820
That's wonderful, Fujiko-san! Truly wonderful!

56
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,920
P-Pardon me!

57
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,280
Thank you.

58
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,950
But I can't believe I'm going to Yugoslavia with Inokuma-san.

59
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,520
It's like a dream.



60
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,640
It's... It's not a dream! You're strong, Fujiko-san. Very strong.

61
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,490
Unlike me.

62
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,530
I too want to be a judo competitor.

63
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,070
I'm simply pathetic.

64
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,770
Hanazono-san?

65
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:01,630
I feel that you'll become really good and go beyond my reach.

66
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,170
Just like Inokuma.

67
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,380
That won't happen.



68
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,650
I'm no good at all.

69
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,890
Back at the tournament, if it hadn't been for your support, I would've lost for sure.

70
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,390
F-Fujiko-san.

The training camp for the World Championships is about to begin.

73
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,760
Teleshikova from the USSR and Jody from Canada:

74
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,540
we have the two main players, which leaves Yawara-san.

75
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,290
Kosaku!

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,800
H-Hey!

77
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,840
What are you trying to pull?

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,760
Kuni-chan made a very special lunch for you!

79
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,770
Ta-da! Doesn't it look yummy?

80
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,040
I worked very hard on it just for you, Kosaku.

81
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,140
Isn't it wonderful?

82
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,440
Why don't you use that time to do some actual work?!

83
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,390
Hey, don't be so bashful, Matsuda!

84
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,690
We know you're thrilled.

85
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,130
Quit showing off!

86
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,090
When's the wedding?

87
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,970
Now those look good.

88
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,520
I know. They're all yours.

89
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,890
Good.

Fun in the Hot Spring Steam

91
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,350
Hot springs?

92
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,440
It's Tsurukame Travel's Cordial Hot Springs Tour.

93
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,540
It's quite popular.

94
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,700
Haven't you seen the TV commercials?

95
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:01,850
"Travel with Tsurukame. Cordial Tsurukame."

96
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,120
I see they have heaps of good eats.

97
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,340
Maybe a hot spring ain't such a bad idea.

98
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,820
I agree!

99
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,400
But we can't.

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,930
Practically everybody is going on those trips,
 and all the popular hot springs are booked solid.

101
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,840
However, there's no need to worry, Grandpa.

102
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,510
If I was working as a travel agent,

103
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,960
I could easily get us a good room, along with delicious food...

104
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,110
Who's gonna be working for who? Huh?!

105
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,870
Wait, I was just saying "what if."

106
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,030
You know, "what if."

107
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,850
I ain't having your "what ifs" or chive liver!

108
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:46,300
Playing judo at Saikai U should be the only thing on your mind, you nitwit!



109
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,460
I wanted to do something nice for you.

110
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,790
If you wanna do something nice,

111
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,430
then play judo, become the world champ, win the gold medal,

112
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,390
and get the National Achievement Award!

113
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,480
I just wanted to take you to a hot spring!

114
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,950
If you wanna go to a hot spring, do it on your honeymoon!

115
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,880
That reminds me. I spent my honeymoon with Kaneko at the Atami Hot Springs.

116
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,870
Coincidentally, it was the night before the outbreak of the Pacific War.

117
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,550
Geez, I've heard that story a hundred times!

118
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,590
Today, I'm going to tell Fujiko-san.

119
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,950
This time I'll be treating you, Inokuma-san.

120
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,840
Huh? You don't have to.

121
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,310
You came along when I applied for my passport, even though you were busy practicing.






122
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,990
You must tell me what it's like inside an airplane and all that!

123
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,140
This is my first trip overseas, after all!

124
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,920
Also, I've been running a lot, so I'm pretty hungry.

125
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,970
Keep it up, Fujiko-san!

126
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,540
What's wrong, Inokuma-san?

127
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,230
You should be eating, since training camp's coming up.

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,230
Oh, about that...

129
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:35,730
Look at this! Look! It's a guidebook for Yugoslavia!

132
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
I'm checking for what to bring back.

133
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,480
Yugoslavia has so many delicious foods!

134
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,140
Oh, there's Madera's sarma.

135
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,320
It says there's no point going to Yugoslavia if you don't try it.

136
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,330
It looks so good. I'm definitely going to eat it!

Raznjici, cevapcici, Bosnian hotpot... 

139
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,130
What is it?

140
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,140
U-Um...

141
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,400
The thing is... um... I...

142
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,400
I...

143
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,360
Wh-What's wrong?

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,570
Fujiko-san, I'm sorry!

145
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,600
Inokuma-san, do you need to go to the bathroom?

146
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,760
Come on. It's nothing to be embarrassed about!

147
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,620
You can go! It's not good to hold it in.

148
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,900
I actually wanted to speak to you about something.

149
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm only able to talk about this now.

150
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,610
When I lost due to that referee's call, I cried when I got home.

151
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,670
I smiled in front of everyone,
 but actually, I was really upset.

152
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,770
I'm only able to say something so shameful to you, Inokuma-san.

153
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,930
Whether it's Yugoslavia or Saikai U, we'll always be together.

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,550
She was dressed pretty smartly. Where is she going?

170
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,480
Not yet!

171
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,010
Sign: Parlor

172
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,260
We're so glad you came to see us.

173
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,860
Though if you'd asked, we would have met you anywhere you like.


174
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,740
Oh, I wouldn't think of that.

175
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,760
Training camp must be stressful.

176
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,730
We saw it on TV and in the newspapers.

177
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,400
She's taking on the world, after all.

178
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,370
That's right. Taking on the world is no easy task.

179
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,400
We would like to be the top travel agency in the world someday.

180
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,680
The world's top travel agency? I'd like that!



181
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:26,510
So what became of your attempt to turn your grandfather around?

182
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,100
Well...

183
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,390
Forgive me, but I will convince him somehow.

184
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,830
So can you give me a little more time?

185
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,120
Of course we will!

186
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,380
We'll give you as long as it takes!

187
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,830
Sign: Travel Consultation

188
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,190
So you're looking for the best hotel in Yugoslavia?

189
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,620
In that case...

190
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,590
Just splendid.

191
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,690
Sorry.

192
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,650
I was just thinking how splendid it would be to travel to Yugoslavia with someone like you.

193
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,670
But this time, I'll be traveling alone.

194
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,020
Actually, it's not just this time. I always travel alone.

195
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,600
Perhaps it's because I work too much?

196
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,990
Even a soldier needs a break once in a while.

197
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,220
How strange.



198
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,820
When I'm with you, I feel more relaxed.

199
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,460
Th-Thank you very much.

200
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,860
How about it? Why don't we go out to dinner or something?

201
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,950
Kazamatsuri-san?

202
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,720
Y-Yawara-san, what are you doing here?

203
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,150
It's Inokuma Yawara!

204
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,080
Yawara?

205
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,010
It's really her!

206
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,210
Work?

207
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,710
Yes.

208
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,460
W-Wait a minute! Why that company?

209
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,650
He's right!
W-Wait a minute! Why that company?

210
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,590
You could've done much better for yourself!

211
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,140
That's not the problem here!

212
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,760
What <i>is</i> the problem?

213
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,460
What about your transfer to Saikai U?

214
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,850
So that's it?

215
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,810
I'm not going to Saikai U.

216
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,930
What? Then what about judo?

217
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,700
Does Tsurukame Travel even have a team?

218
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,920
No, it doesn't.

219
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,670
It doesn't? Then how will you play judo?

220
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,000
Honestly, all you talk about is judo!

221
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,280
Yawara-san has had enough of judo, what with the World Championships coming up.

222
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,750
Let's not talk about judo over her noon break.

223
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,800
Right?

224
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,260
I have to get back to camp. It's time for my training.

225
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,150
Now wait! Why are you bending over backwards to get a job?




226
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,420
Must you always be the aggressive reporter?

227
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,900
I told you before that my first career choice was to be a travel agent.

228
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,970
Yeah, you want to work using your own abilities,

229
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,760
and you'll be able to see the world at a travel agency.

230
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,290
Isn't that great? I admire your motivation.

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,430
I actually have one more reason.

232
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,750
I thought...

233
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,170
that working at a travel agency would make it easier for me...

234
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,630
to search for my father.

235
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,920
If I work at a travel agency, there's a chance I'll meet someone

236
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,230
who gave my dad a boarding pass or saw him at one of his destinations.

237
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,880
Oh, yeah...





238
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,900
Th-That's good thinking.
 Don't you agree, Matsuda-san?

239
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,170
Oh, no. I'm really going to be late!

240
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,460
What should we do now?

241
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,380
What should we do? Why are you asking me?

242
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,560
If that's the case, then I'll take her to him!

243
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,070
I'm reuniting her with her dad!

244
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,810
Come on, Kazamatsuri!
 Tell me where Kojiro-san is!

245
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,890
Where's Kojiro-san right now?

246
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,800
Kojiro-san is Sayaka-san's coach.

247
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,880
If you let Yawara-san see him, how do you think she'll react?

248
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,570
Geez, why didn't you stop him from becoming her coach?

249
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,660
Sayaka-san practically begged him.

250
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,130
You think I could've stopped it?



251
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,280
I was going to pick up the check, but forget it!

252
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,920
Pay for your own coffee.

253
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,830
<i>All Sports</i> really does pay you peanuts, doesn't it?

254
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,460
I'll pay for Yawara-san's drink!

255
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,230
No need to strain yourself.

256
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,860
You're paid below market, so I'll take care of it.

257
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,400
No, I will!


258
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,300
I have this!

259
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,960
No, you don't!

260
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,890
Yes I do!

261
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,360
O-One more time, please.

262
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,780
Come on. That's enough.

263
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,860
I have to go spar with the guys on the national team.

264
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,710
Please!

265
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,310
Just one more round! I think I'm beginning to understand!

266
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,430
All right.

267
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,440
Un, deux, trois...

268
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,270
So that's the Ito Fujiko I've been hearing about?



269
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,480
Yeah, she's pretty good, Yamashita.

270
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,270
Un!

271
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,580
Not only is she good, it's a waste of good talent to use her as just a training player!

272
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,780
Master Inokuma Jigoro, when did you get here?

273
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,780
Deux!


274
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,440
Doesn't it taste great? 
This is Beanpole's home brew.

275
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,910
Oh, this is good.

276
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,090
Her tea is as good as her judo.

277
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,690
Yes, only because I taught her well.

278
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,940
She has the height and the balance.

279
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,250
She'd be evenly matched with a foreign opponent. Right?

280
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,800
By the way, Director Yanagizawa, have you decided on the free-weight player yet?

281
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,530
No, not yet. However, we'd really like it to be Yawara-san.

282
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,140
Trois!

283
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,300
Y-Yamada-san?

284
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,640
His head took the entire blow!

285
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,020
Hey, are you all right, Yamada?

286
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,800
Nope, he's out like a light.

287
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,050
I'm sorry!

288
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,790
I'm sorry! Oh gosh, wait... why?

289
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:43,990
S-O-R-R-Y!

Fujiko-san's really relishing this trip.

293
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,970
Yeah, she should enjoy it while it lasts.

294
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,870
What do you mean by that?

295
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,810
This tatsuta-age is delicious!

296
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,950
I know you're up to something, Grandpa.




297
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,710
You can expect some very interesting developments.
