1
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,280
It's the third round of the women's 52 kg competition.

2
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,650
Japan's Yokomizo is down a Yuko!

3
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,330
Get around her! Get around her!

4
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,660
Keep moving your feet!

5
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,080
Italy's Mastroianni with a Kosoto Gari!

6
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Damn you!

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,790
No!

8
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,000
Ippon! Done!

9
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,350
Yokomizo is done!

10
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,810
Japan's women's team has yet to win a gold medal!

11
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,110
So now we place our last hopes on Inokuma Yawara, who will compete in the 48kg-and-unders tomorrow!




12
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,850
Also, who will represent us in the open-weight matches?

13
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:16,860
First Time Under Pressure

14
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,000
So you're the final hope to win a gold medal tomorrow, Inokuma-san?

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,330
Care to share your enthusiasm?

16
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,000
Enthusiasm? Now wait...

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,340
Look, I'm about to go somewhere.



18
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,820
Talk about carefree! Going shopping?

19
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,760
We're BBC UK!

20
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,090
Are we going to see your Ippon Zeoi tomorrow?

21
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,100
Will you be entering the open-weight competition?

22
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,810
Wow, Inokuma-san is even grabbing international headlines.

23
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,310
Hey, Yawara!

24
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,440
Jody!

25
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,400
We're leaving! Fujiko, let's go!

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,860
C-Coming!

27
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,130
Wait!

28
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,150
Just a word!

29
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,570
Right, just ask me anything.

30
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,330
I, the 7-dan, 8-dan, no, 9-dan black belt will answer any question.

31
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,250
Oh, so you're Yawara Inokuma's grandfather, Master Jigoro? We're BBC UK.

32
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,710
BCG? What are you, a vaccine?

33
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,480
Yawara, let's go look at that souvenir shop.

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,290
Okay.

35
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,020
Excuse me, Jody-san.

36
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,140
What, Fujiko?



37
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,510
Inokuma-san has her match tomorrow. Are you sure we should be doing this?

38
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,610
Yes, I am. Yawara's feeling pressure for the first time.

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,410
She's feeling discouraged, not to mention tense, without Matsuda around.

40
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,770
W-Will she be all right?

41
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,910
That's why we're taking her out on the town.

42
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,640
She needs to have a little fun, okay?

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,060
Okay, okay.



44
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,920
What's going on?

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,380
Nothing to worry about.

46
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,200
No way! You're actually going to give that hat to Hanazono-kun?


47
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,770
He might look really cute in it!

48
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,390
Found one! I'm getting this poncho for my darling!

49
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,730
Have you chosen something, Yawara?

50
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,400
A souvenir for Matsuda, silly!

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,650
She's right. You need to get him something!

52
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,120
He already goes lots of places to cover events. He doesn't need a souvenir.

53
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,610
What are you saying? It'll make him happy!

54
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,380
How about these shoes?

55
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,120
Forget it.

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,630
Besides... Besides...

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,760
Kosaku gets excited and bored with things really easily.

58
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,090
Once someone becomes a superstar, he gets bored with them right away.

59
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,310
I-I almost forgot, Yawara!
 We're going to have some cake!

60
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,800
Th-That's right! Let's sweeten things up with some cake!

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,570
We'll make it a party!


62
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,820
So there you have it.

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,990
My five, six, no, seven national titles could not have been accomplished in a day.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,500
First — practice. Second — practice. And skipping third and fourth...

65
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,700
Fifth!

66
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,170
Fifth?

67
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,210
Stuff yourself with good food!

68
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,100
That's amazing, Master Jigoro!



69
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,900
So you're saying that everything in life is connected to judo?

70
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,030
You're quick to catch on, BCG.

71
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,810
As we say, "You don't make war on an empty stomach."

72
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,440
Impressive.</i>


73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,160
He somehow turned the interview into one of his lectures.</i>

74
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,250
He's enchanted not just the reporters</i>

75
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,360
but also the foreign athletes who don't understand a word.</i>

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,110
Impressive, Master Inokuma Jigoro!</i>


77
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,570
Coach, we need to enter someone for tomorrow's open-weight matches.

78
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,120
O-Oh right, I'm coming.

79
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,140
Tohdoh, will your leg be all right?

80
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,210
Yes, sir, Coach! It's coming along fine!

81
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,130
Still, Tohdoh can't manage the open-weights with that pain.</i>

82
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,130
Yeah, Takabe was in peak form for the 72kg-and-under matches,

83
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,060
but now she has this hip thing.

84
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,560
I see. How about Obayashi?




85
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,490
You saw how she lost to that Canadian, Adams.

86
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,310
She's still pretty devastated about it.

87
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,240
Then I guess it'll have to be Inokuma Yawara.

88
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,660
Yes, let's go with her!

89
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,710
The 48kg-and-under and open-weight classes are held consecutively,

90
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,910
but I know she can pull it off.

91
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,500
My, my...

92
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,670
Master!

93
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,720
Hey there, Coach. Boy, oh boy, that interview turned into a full autograph session.

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,220
Well, you did honor them with a very profound discussion.

95
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,670
If you'll excuse me.

96
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,190
By the way, Coach, have you decided who'll compete in the open-weight matches?

97
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,260
Yes, I'm about to enter her name.

98
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,650
But I know it might be too much to ask.




99
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,650
It looks like you've been agonizing over it.

100
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,770
No, that's not what I mean.

101
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,450
Okay, I have an idea.

102
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Two Japanese female judo players have caught my fancy.

103
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,550
I've written their names on my palms.

104
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,050
Right...

105
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,470
So which will be your entrant, left or right?

106
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,220
Wh-Which? Master, are you sure this is the best way to decide?

107
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,770
It doesn't matter how! Both of them are pretty good.

108
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,960
Th-These are players that live up to the standards</i>

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,610
of internationally renowned judoka, Master Jigoro.</i>

110
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,380
One must be Inokuma Yawara.</i>

111
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,080
And the other... actually rivals Inokuma Yawara?</i>

112
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,960
If he says it, then there's no mistake about it.</i>

113
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,250
This one.

114
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,970
N-No, wait! This one!

115
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,430
This one? Remember, a judoka always sticks to his word!

116
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,070
Y-Yes.

117
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,320
Fujiko, you really bought a lot!



118
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,240
Since I'm not competing, I'm focusing all my strength on shopping!

119
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,050
She's back!

120
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,670
We were waiting!

121
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,550
Please, a word!

122
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,640
Will you give it a rest!

123
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,470
Inokuma-san has a very important match tomorrow, so please let her be!

124
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,980
Well, Inokuma-san is one thing...

125
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,190
...but right now we want to interview you! That's right, you!

126
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,340
Got that right!

127
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,730
You never cease to amaze us!

128
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,890
You were suddenly picked as a regular competitor.

129
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,230
So tell us how you feel about being a Cinderella?

130
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,700
Wh-What are you talking about?

131
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,720
A regular competitor?

132
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,610
For what?

133
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,520
We're talking about how Ito Fujiko-san got picked!

134
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,580
To compete in tomorrow's open-weight matches!

135
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,640
Go on, Beanpole, eat up! No need to watch your weight for the open-weights!

136
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,090
Yeah.

137
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,610
You need to eat now while you can.

138
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,100
Tomorrow you'll be too nervous to have an appetite.

139
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,650
Go on, eat!

140
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,990
I've already lost my appetite!

141
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,160
Fujiko-san.






142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,630
I really can't wait for tomorrow's matches.

143
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,580
I want to see your big exploits.

144
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,920
Huh? You look down, Yawara-san.

145
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,660
Is Fujiko-san's nervousness rubbing off on you?

146
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,290
Why are you getting nervous over this little tournament?

147
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,600
It's just a warm-up for the Barcelona Olympics.

148
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,430
Master, what did you write on the palms of your hands?

149
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,600
Oh, this?

150
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,570
Just some written charms.

151
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,610
Left hand: Fujiko
Right hand: Ito#

152
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,440
No way! Yawara has to compete in the open-weights!

153
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,450
She's the reason why I entered the open-weights!

154
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,640
Calm down, Teleshikova.

155
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,270
We'll leave Inokuma Yawara to Khrushchev.

156
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,880
Don't slack off just because Yawara isn't in the open-weights.

157
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,970
Master Jigoro, who trained Yawara, also coached the player who's replacing her.

158
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,850
Yawara is my only opponent!

159
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,730
Yawara.

160
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,960
Dammit. All this flying, and I'm still not there!</i>







161
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,340
You'll win the 48kg-and-unders, right, Yawara-san?</i>

162
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,160
And are you entering the open-weights?</i>

163
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,850
Yawara-san.</i>

164
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,220
Whether she's the world champion or the strongest woman around,

165
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,710
she's still a normal girl.

166
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,390
Well, it doesn't hurt to try for her, at least while you're still young.

167
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,880
Can't sleep?

168
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,620
I'm sorry, Inokuma-san. Did I wake you up?

169
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,190
No, I can't sleep either.

170
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,990
Even Inokuma-san is nervous?</i>



171
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,150
So she really does feel disheartened without Matsuda-san.</i>

172
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,290
I don't blame you, Fujiko-san.</i>

173
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,120
They picked you to compete the day before the tournament.</i>

174
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,120
D-Don't worry! You'll come back to Japan wearing the gold medal!



175
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,080
You've gotten really good yourself, Fujiko-san.

176
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,530
I'm terrible!

177
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,110
I'll be going back to Japan after losing in the first round.

178
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,780
I really do want to go back to Japan.

179
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,880
That's right. That way you can see him.

180
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,520
I mean, that way we can eat ramen!

181
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,900
Yes, I want to eat ramen! And maybe some soup!

182
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,930
No. I better not get her worked up by mentioning Matsuda-san.</i>

183
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,140
Oh, yeah, I have something for us!

184
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,450
What is it?

185
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,910
Dried plums!

186
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,120
Let me have some!

187
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Go ahead, take one!

188
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,780
Inokuma-san—
Fujiko-san—

189
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,900
What?

190
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,510
It's nothing.

191
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,310
It makes me want to cry.</i>

192
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,250
But I have to hold back.</i>

193
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,480
Inokuma-san must be feeling lonely too.</i>

194
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,770
I can't tell her I'm scared.</i>

195
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,490
It'll only make Fujiko-san more nervous.</i>

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,030
But still, why? Why am I so scared?</i>

197
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,120
Well then, now that I've had my fill of breakfast, it's time to move out!

198
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,260
Yes. Laugh or cry, this is our last day.

199
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,720
We must do our very best.

200
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,160
Who's gonna be crying? Come on, laugh it up!

201
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,300
There'll be a whole lot of laughing once we get our gold medals!

202
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,430
Coach!

203
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,650
They've just announced the pairings!

204
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,340
Because nobody in the 48 kg class is competing in the open-weight class,

205
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,400
both sets of matches will be held at the same time in Rings A and B.

206
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,870
S-So what about the pairings?

207
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,250
Well, Yawara won't have any problems against France's Deneuve in the opening round.

208
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,950
But in the open-weights, Ito will be facing...

209
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,820
Martinez of Cuba?!




210
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,630
She gave Canada's Rockwell a run for her money in the 72 kg heavyweight title match!

211
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,080
Th-This isn't good.

212
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,400
L-Listen, don't tell Ito!

213
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,040
She's a nervous wreck as it is!

214
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,140
If she finds out who she's fighting first, she'll faint!

215
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,100
So Beanpole will be facing that Manekineko first?</i>

216
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,570
Huh? Huh?

217
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,660
What's wrong, Ito-san?

218
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,270
I-I forgot my belt!

219
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,790
What, you forgot your belt? Someone lend her theirs!

220
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,890
But she's a white belt.

221
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,710
Yeah, that's right.

222
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,390
There are no white belts in the World Championships!

223
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,420
Someone give her a black belt!

224
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,530
Yes, sir!

225
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,880
Geez, what's the deal?

226
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,840
Maybe I shouldn't have put her in.

227
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,230
Yawara-san.

228
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,860
So this is where you are?




229
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,700
I think you should start warming up.

230
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,350
Kazamatsuri-san.

231
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,810
I guess you're nervous.

232
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,910
Uh, I'm not.

233
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,140
I know. I know full well.

234
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,370
It's normal for someone to get scared before a match.

235
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:27,920
Yes.

236
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,110
What's wrong? This isn't like you at all.

237
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,390
Come on. Remember how you usually handle things.

238
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,080
You won the World Cup.

239
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,360
Nothing's changed since that day.

240
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,630
Well, maybe one thing.

241
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,950
That loudmouth Matsuda-san isn't around.

242
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,070
We can enjoy ourselves much more here than at Seoul.

243
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,530
I swear, that Matsuda-san was always hovering around you like a moth—

244
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,540
I-It can't be.</i>

245
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,810
I-Is Matsuda-san's absence making Yawara-san so...</i>

246
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,370
Impossible!</i>

247
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,200
N-No, that's just too absurd.</i>

248
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,440
That's right. There's no way I'd lose out to that third-rate perpetual hack.</i>

249
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,440
There's no possible way.</i>

250
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
It will be all right, Yawara-san.

251
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,240
See, I'm right here to look after you.

252
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,760
Yippee!



253
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,340
Superstar Yawara-chan spends quality time with her boyfriend before the match!

254
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,430
What a big scoop!

255
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,890
Y-You can't just sneak a picture of us like that!

256
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,100
Anything a superstar does is newsworthy.

257
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,470
Even Kosaku would say this is a nice shot.




258
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,100
Yawara-san, don't worry. I'll just recover the film...

259
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,640
Huh?

260
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,320
I-I've finally made it to Belgrade!

261
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,330
It might have arrived later than usual, but I'll make it to the first round!

262
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,200
Taxi!

263
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,810
Pioneer Hall! You know, yes? Pioneer!

264
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,120
Pardon?

265
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,170
It is Pioneer! Of Belgrade!

266
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,470
Belgrade? No, no! Zagreb!

267
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,930
Z-Zagray... What?

268
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,020
[Speaking Croatian] 

269
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:51,080
No, no, you speak English. English! But keep it simple.

270
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,910
Fog! Belgrade, fog!

271
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,400
Turn to Zagreb!

272
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,430
M-Maybe...

273
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,970
Z-Zagreb is Yugoslavia's second largest city.

274
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,410
And that guy just said "fog."

275
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,380
So that means—

276
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,870
They weren't able to land in Belgrade because of fog?

277
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,750
And so they went to Zagreb?!

278
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,000
So how does that black belt feel on you?

279
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,470
Stand up straight, dang it!
 We can't even see that black belt!

280
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,500
Y-Yes, sir.

281
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,290
C'mon! It's time to put some finishing touches on your "un, deux, trois"!

282
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,870
Um, but Inokuma-san's about to begin her first round.

283
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,220
Don't worry about Yawara. Worry about yourself.

284
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,570
Now, hone your "un, deux, trois"!

285
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,090
O-Of course.




286
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,790
What'll I do?</i>

287
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,070
I can't. I'm scared.</i>



288
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,800
Why? Why am I so scared?</i>

289
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,650
Inokuma-san, it's almost time.

290
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,440
Good luck! Win this for us!

291
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,420
No need to worry! Inokuma-san will come through for us!

292
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,350
She's my fated rival, after all.

293
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,280
Tohdoh, since when did you become her "fated rival"?

294
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,250
Anyways, I'll be rooting for you, just for today!

295
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,240
Thank you.

296
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,200
Inokuma, you're up!



297
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,500
Yes, go get 'em!

298
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,670
Fight hard! We're counting on you!

299
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,950
All right. Just take me there.

300
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,090
Belgrade?

301
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,670
Yes. Belgrade, Pioneer Hall.

302
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,050
Okay!

303
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,380
By the way, how far is it to Belgrade?

304
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,980
Driver, show me the map.

305
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,320
The map! Map!

306
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,340
Okay, so we're in Zagreb.

307
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,240
Belgrade... Belgrade...

308
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,700
F-Four hundred twenty kilometers?!</i>

309
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,200
H-Hey, wait a minute! Driver!

310
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,630
Inokuma Yawara finally makes her appearance!

311
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,760
Everyone in Japan has been waiting for this.

312
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,360
Even the world has been waiting for this.

313
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,090
Inokuma Yawara has appeared in the 48kg-and-unders!

314
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,980
Yamashita-san, Inokuma is finally competing.

315
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,560
Yes, it's been a long wait.

316
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,700
Her Ippon Zeoi in the All-Japan Championships was as polished as ever.

317
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,110
It's her first international tournament since the World Cup, but she'll pull it off here.

318
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,690
Inokuma's first opponent is the freshman player from France, Deneuve.

319
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,760
Just based on their records, is this Inokuma's game to lose?

320
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,540
Inokuma-san, fight her!

321
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,500
Yawara-san, it's all right! I'm right here!

322
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,010
Inokuma-san!

323
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,550
Hey, quit rubbernecking and do your "un, deux, trois"!

324
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,010
Y-Yes, sir!

325
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,030
Hajime!

326
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,960
It's Deneuve with an Uchi Mata!

327
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,920
Impossible!

329
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,560
Yawara, what in blue blazes was that?!

330
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,280
If this is where you're gonna lose,

331
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,290
then you're doing a hundred belly crawls on the Trans-Siberian Railway!
If this is where you're gonna lose,

then you're doing a hundred belly crawls on the Trans-Siberian Railway!

333
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,440
Ah, Fujiko-san's match has already started!

334
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,610
What is that idiot up to now?

335
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,150
Fujiko-san, hang in there! Un, deux, trois!

336
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,410
You dang-blasted losers! I'm through with all of you!

337
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:16,780
Yawara!
