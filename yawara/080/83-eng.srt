1
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,620
Pretend you're Tohdoh and you're timing your move against that Manekineko girl.

2
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,530
Let me through!

3
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,560
Kosaku! Are you listening, Kosaku?

4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,750
You must come home now, Kosaku!

5
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,350
Your father... Your father... just suffered a stroke!

6
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,500
Dad!
Your father... Your father... just suffered a stroke!

7
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,720
Wow! Martinez gets a Kosoto Gari Ippon! Tohdoh is finished!

8
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,470
You big dummy! You just lost by an Ippon!

9
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,020
You won't be returning to Japan wearing a medal that way.

10
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,980
A medal?

11
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:18,030
Jam-Packed with International Contenders!

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Kosaku didn't come, you know.

13
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,000
Maybe he got bored with her.

14
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,110
Yawara-chan <i>has</i> become quite the superstar now!

15
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,010
Kosaku gets excited and then bored with things really easily.

16
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,010
Ippon! Done!

17
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,410
Jody Rockwell's too strong!

18
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,020
She defeats the Soviet Yeltsina easily and
 advances to the 72 kg heavyweight title match!

19
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,620
Because Teleshikova is only appearing in the open-weight competition,

20
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,410
they went with their second best player, Yeltsina.

21
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,240
Right, but she was simply no match for Rockwell.

22
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,660
Jody!




23
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,660
Yawara! Were you watching?

24
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,020
Yeah!

25
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,420
So you're going to the championship match? Don't let up.

26
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,920
Jody-san is so strong!

27
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,670
This ain't no time to gawk.

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,500
You need to watch the title match, study their moves, and get your timing down.

29
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,130
Un, deux, trois.


30
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,230
O-Okay.

31
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,690
But you said something about coming home with a medal.

32
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,880
What did you mean by that?

33
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,450
I can't get a medal because I'm not competing in any matches.

34
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,660
You gotta love those medals.
 'Specially those shiny gold ones.

35
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,920
Those shiny gold ones.


36
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,670
Smooth and shiny?

37
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,040
The first day of the World Judo Championships has made everyone excited!

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,470
The 72 kg women's heavyweight title match is about to begin!

39
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,640
So who is going to take the crown?



40
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,530
Will it be Martinez of Cuba, a total newcomer to international competition who made it to the finals

41
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,050
after defeating Tohdoh Yuki in the semis?

42
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,930
Or will it be Canada's Rockwell, twice 72 kg heavyweight world champion,

43
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,550
who injured her left knee ligament

44
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,510
during the open-weight match with Teleshikova last year,

45
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,730
then suffered an accident

46
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,340
that aggravated the injury during an invitational match against Teleshikova,

47
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,920
but who's now recovered?!

48
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,420
Jody, hang in there!






49
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,910
Still, where did Grandpa and Fujiko-san run off to?

50
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,360
Listen up. You're Joe-day, see? 

51
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,430
Now do that move of yours on that Manekineko girl.

52
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,260
Y-Yes!

53
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,390
Hajime!


54
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,860
Th-They're scary!

55
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,360
Don't get scared. Just time your "un, deux, trois"!

56
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,660
Jody, don't let her get a good hold on you!</i>

57
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,540
Right there!</i>

58
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,500
Un, deux, trois!

59
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,750
No!

60
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,920
Yuko!

61
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,800
Incredible! Rockwell is unexpectedly toppled by Martinez's Kouchi Gari!

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Jody!

63
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,350
You dummy! You lost by an Ippon right there!

64
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,060
You mustn't take Martinez lightly. Yamashita-san?



65
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,320
That's right. She has good balance and bounce.

66
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,000
Not only that, Martinez also has great speed.

67
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,820
She can do it!

68
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,570
Un, deux...

69
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,540
Rockwell with an Osoto!

70
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,080
No, Martinez counters with a Harai Goshi!

71
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,040
Jody, get away!

72
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,660
Jougai! Mate!

73
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,960
Rockwell's in an unexpectedly tough battle!

74
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,630
She's got herself a hell of an opponent in this rising star from Cuba!

75
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,600
I don't know! I just don't know!

76
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,340
How am I supposed to time my moves?!

77
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,280
Just keep looking. You're bound to find an opening.

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,270
I would've flipped that Manekineko girl five times by now!

79
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,080
Hajime!

80
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,870
Look hard.</i>

81
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,580
Just keep looking. Keep looking. Keep looking!

82
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,080
There has to be an opening.</i>

83
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,130
There must be an opening!




84
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,810
Now, Jody!

85
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,810
Un!

86
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,100
Deux!

87
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,150
Ippon! Done!

88
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,490
All right!

89
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,870
It's Jody Rockwell with a stirring Uchi Mata Ippon!

90
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,950
This is her third 72 kg heavyweight title in a row!

91
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,170
That was a magnificent Ippon.

92
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,930
Congratulations, Jody!

93
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,800
Thank you, Yawara!

94
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,700
I was in a cold sweat for a minute there.

95
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,880
Martinez is pretty strong.

96
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,310
Good! Now face this way!

97
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,060
I caught you in all your glory, Jody-san!

98
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,600
You might not make the <i>All Sports</i> front page, but you'll make page three!

99
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,570
Oh, <i>All Sports</i> ? Where's Matsuda?

100
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,540
Kosaku won't be coming this time!

101
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,180
Why?

102
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,490
What did you say?

103
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,080
Oh, Kazamatsuri-san, you came!

104
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,720
Yawara-san, forgive my lateness. I've just arrived.

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,600
Wow, super match, Jody-san!

106
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,550
Now, Matsuda-san didn't come?

107
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,740
No, he didn't!

108
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,060
Kosaku loves discovering new superstars, but he gets bored once they reach superstardom.

109
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,690
Is that right?





110
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,220
I always knew Matsuda-san was that type of guy.

111
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,200
It's a hassle! If I wasn't around, he couldn't even be bothered!

112
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,660
Matsuda's not that kind of guy!

113
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,160
Jody, let's go!

114
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Huh, what? Y-Yawara-san!

115
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,850
Yawara, what's wrong?

116
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,380
You know she's lying!

117
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,690
Yawara!

118
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,220
Sign: Yamagata Prefectural General Hospital#

119
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,890
Dad!
Sign: Yamagata Prefectural General Hospital#

120
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,390
Dad, don't die!

121
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,730
Hang on. I'm right here!

122
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,210
Kosaku! You're being too loud!

123
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,810
What are you saying? This is no place forâ€”

124
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,810
Please be quiet!

125
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,040
Sorry.

126
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,510
We're sorry.

127
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,190
See?

128
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,430
Geez, can't a guy sleep in peace?

129
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,410
Dad?

130
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,160
Honey.

131
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,670
Oh, Kosaku. What are you doing here?

132
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,210
Where do you get off asking me that?!

133
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,190
You're in a hospital, for God's sake.

134
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,670
It ain't nothing.

135
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,620
What about your job?

136
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,930
I'm taking time off. I had to miss the World Judo Championships.

137
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,690
Go to the World Championships. Forget about me.

138
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,690
Like hell I'll forget about you.

139
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,630
Not now.

140
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,360
Judo, huh?

141
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,160
You making any progress, boy?

142
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,660
Huh, with what?

143
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,620
You've sealed the deal with Inokuma Yawara, haven't you?

144
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,670
W-Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

145
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,140
Give it up, will ya?

146
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,960
Wh-What the hell?! Didn't you just tell me I can do what I want?!

147
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,180
That was then, this is now.

148
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,340
Think about it. Yawara-chan is gonna become the world champion at that tournament.

149
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,690
A third-rate reporter like you for a third-rate newspaper will be out of her league.

150
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,690
I know all that.

151
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,430
She's just too good for you.

152
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,070
It's like trying to reach the sun.

153
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,370
I know, all right! Now stop talking and sleep already!

154
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,990
Be quiet!

155
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,870
Oh, sorry.





156
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,670
She's right. I knew all along I was nothing but newspaper fodder to him.</i>

157
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,960
Yawara!

158
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,540
Yawara!

159
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,990
Khrushchev, that's Yawara Inokuma.

160
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,700
And you're in the 48 kg class.

161
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,400
Teleshikova will defeat her in the open-weights.

162
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,900
You two will put an end to her reign.

163
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,530
I will.

164
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,920
Yawara!

165
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,030
I don't care.</i>

166
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,040
Not for Matsuda-san.</i>

167
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,170
Sign: Hotel Matsuda#

168
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,920
Give it up, will ya?

169
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,670
She's just too good for you.

170
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,380
It's like trying to reach the sun.

171
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,390
Who am I, Icarus?

172
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,430
What's this about strippers?

173
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,890
Nothing.

174
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,650
I'm sorry, Kosaku.

175
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,570
Huh, about what?

176
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,070
I shouldn't have called you here. You have a job to do at the World Judo Championships.

177
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,020
Really? You were bawling on the phone when Dad collapsed.

178
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,330
Still, how are you going to run the hotel now that you're by yourself?

179
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,300
The Uedas will send Kumi-chan to help out for a while.

180
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,930
But it doesn't look like your father will be in any condition to keep working.

181
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,760
It seems we'll have to make a decision.

182
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,310
D-Don't worry. If it comes to it, I'll...

183
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,820
Oh please, you're not even willing!

184
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,220
Nobody's asking you to come back.

185
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,790
But...

186
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,780
Things wouldn't be easier if you lent a hand anyhow.

187
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,130
You can't even cook or clean your way out of a paper bag.

188
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,450
I can clean, at least.





189
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,500
Heck, your apartment in Tokyo's probably a garbage dump.

190
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,770

Heck, your apartment in Tokyo's probably a garbage dump.

191
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,250
Toothpaste: WHITE#

192
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,700
And besides, you're finally hitting your stride as a sports reporter.

193
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,260
Your place isn't here.

194
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,670
I can tell by your articles on Inokuma Yawara.

195
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,350
You love what you're doing, don't you?

196
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,360
So enough of your nonsense.


197
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,730
Finish your food. I'd better see a clean plate.

198
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,090
Uh, yeah.


199
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,290
Here's Japan's Obayashi.

200
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,000
The 61 kg semifinals are starting.

201
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,760
Ogawa just won the gold medal in the men's 92 kg heavyweight class,

202
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,290
but not one of our women has taken a gold yet!



203
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,010
We really need Obayashi to kick start things today.

204
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,980
Get her, Obayashi!

205
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,220
You can do it!

206
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,220
What? They know you'll win the gold anyway.


207
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,690
They may even make you do double duty in the 48kg-and-under and the open-weight classes.

208
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,970
Right?

209
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,260
What is it, Yawara-san? This isn't like you.


210
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,000
Actually, there's nothing wrong with me.

211
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,780
I mean it.

212
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,640
I get it.

213
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,420
Staying undefeated for such a long time would put even <i>the</i> Yawara-san under pressure.


214
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,670
I know that feeling all too well.

215
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,170
I know!

216
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,540
How's this for an idea?

217
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,890
Once the World Championship is over, why don't we take in the sights around the Adriatic?


218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,630
It'll be wonderful. The blue seas, old townscapes...

219
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,410
It would do us both good to relaxâ€”

220
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,980
Yawara!
It would do us both good to relaxâ€”

221
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,480
Did you see the first and second rounds?

222
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,490
What, you didn't see? Come with me.

223
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,990
Hey, wait! We weren't done talking!

224
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,330
What is it, Jody?

225
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:56,780
There's also the Sveti Stefan Hotel where Charles and Diana stayed for their honeymoon!

226
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,340
I've reserved a room there!

227
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,870
What is it, Jody?

228
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,460
Look!

229
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,270
That's Kristin-san!

230
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,010
That's right.


231
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,860
She's Canada's Great White Hope. You fought her at my wedding party.

232
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,440
Kristin Adams.

233
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,870
But she looks thinner than I remember.

234
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,580
Good luck, Kristin!

235
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,440
Hi!


236
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:35,830
Yes, she dropped from the 66 kg
 to the 61 kg weight class.

237
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,410
Do you know why?

238
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,400
You lit a fire inside her.

239
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,740
Kristin is just like me.

240
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,920
She wants to fight you. You're her goal.

241
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:53,750
In order to emulate your speed and polished techniques, she went on a diet.

242
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,400
She's also trained really hard.

243
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,890
Bow!

244
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,890
Hajime!

245
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, Beanpole. 61 kg would be your weight class if you were actually competing.

246
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,980
Uh, right.


247
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,530
So am I going to practice timing my "un, deux, trois" here too?

248
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,380
Of course you are!


249
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,740
Now pick your point of attack!

250
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Yes, sir!

251
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,000
Obayashi! Block her moves!

252
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,850
She's fast!

253
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,510
Isn't she?

254
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,180
Now there's a girl with some fight in her!

255
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,760
She's so fast I can't see straight!

256
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,030
Ippon! Done!

257
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,200
Obayashi is crushed!

258
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,440
Canada's Adams unleashed a Tsurikomi Goshi at breakneck speed!

259
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,700
What do you think? She's a lot stronger than she was before.



260
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,260
That goes for everyone.

261
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,210
Teleshikova, me... Everyone has you in their sights.

262
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:15,420
The top players in the world have gotten stronger just to beat you.

263
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,260
Yawara?

264
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,470
Yawara?



265
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,900
I've never seen her so tense.</i>

266
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,940
She must be feeling discouraged without Matsuda. I know.</i>

267
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,420
We have ourselves another contender! I can't wait to see her in Barcelona!

268
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,450
Ah, that was scary!

269
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,230
So how'd that "un, deux, trois" go?

270
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,190
She didn't give me a chance to do it.

271
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,550
You nincompoop!


272
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,710
If you don't straighten out, that medal will just be a dream within a dream inside a danged dream!

273
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,560
Y-You're right!


274
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,970
Even I need to start focusing on getting a medal someday.

275
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,970
There's no "someday" about it.
 We're talking about now!

276
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,940
Y-You can't be serious!

277
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,230
The Japanese women's team suffers an unexpected upset after Obayashi loses in the semis!

278
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,860
They have yet to win a gold medal!


279
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,860
They're down to their last day. They're pinning their hopes on Inokuma Yawara!

And with that, we sign off from Pioneer Hall in Belgrade.

284
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,090
What's this favor you're asking for?

285
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,310
I have no right to ask this,
 especially with Dad in the hospital.

286
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,760
Yugoslavia, is it? That's pretty far.

287
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,770
I believe this should cover it.

288
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,110
Mom...

289
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,120
They're not going to pay your expenses
 because the tournament is almost over.

290
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,780
The cost for your trip to Yamagata must be nothing to sneeze at either.

291
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,630
Whatever your father said, that's just his illness making him fainthearted.

292
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,390
Whether she's the world champion or the strongest woman around,

293
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,680
she's still a normal girl.

294
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,100
Well, it doesn't hurt to try for her, at least while you're still young.

295
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,190
Thank you. I'll pay you back soon.




296
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm not counting on it.

297
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,510
I'm leaving!

298
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,120
Yes, go!

299
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,660
As for Dad...

300
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,040
He's got me, remember?

301
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,050
Yeah, well...

302
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,840
There's nothing to worry about!

303
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,540
No, I mean...

Bonehead, you call this an article? Rewrite it!

345
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,150
So you think you need another two or three days?

346
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,670
I see. Be sure to support your mother.

347
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,620
I told you to change that headline!

348
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,080
Right.

349
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,200
Sorry about this, Chief.

350
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,830
Oh, don't sweat it.

351
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,840
Attention please. All those boarding flight 718 to Moscow...

352
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm really sorry!

353
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,290
No problem. Take all the time you need.

354
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,090
That moron!

355
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,060
What sort of flight takes off from Yamagata to Moscow?

356
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,450
Be sure to bring back good material.

357
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,620
Whether she's the world champion or the strongest woman around,

358
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,620
she's still a normal girl.

359
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,260
Well, it doesn't hurt to try for her, at least while you're still young.

Yawara, you and Beanpole are getting two gold medals on the last day.

362
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,220
At least I hope so.

363
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,550
What are you saying? Anyone who learns judo from me is guaranteed to win.

364
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,020
I've never felt so scared playing a match before.

365
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,370
Come on, you're up. Now win it with a bang! A bang, dangit!

366
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,430
I swear, what's happened to me?

367
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,330
Yawara!

368
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,750
First Time Under Pressure.

369
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,870
You'll be getting my Ura Nage if you don't watch!
