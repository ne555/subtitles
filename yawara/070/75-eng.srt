00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,450
I've loved him.

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,120
I've always been waiting.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,170
I showed off whenever he was around.

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,760
But I acted cool, like I didn't care.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
My career and love life?

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,640
I do think they're both important.

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,350
But when I see his smile,
aitsu no egao ga yappari

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,150
I know it's what I want the most.

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,110
He proposed to me; was it real?

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,860
I feel like I'm stuck in a crosswalk.

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,280
It's so unbelievable.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,740
I'm frozen and I can't take a step.

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,660
My umbrella rolls away like a flower.

00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,380
Horns don't get through my ears.

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,260
I stand there still, in the pouring rain.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,220
The world is silent and completely still,

19
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,180
As you and I see each other, eye to eye.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,720
Kiss! Kiss!
Chu! Chu!

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,490
Un, deux, trois!

22
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,780
This is it.
Un, deux, trois!

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,290
This is what I've been waiting for all these years.

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,750
I get to be close to Yawara-san as her coach,

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,290
and Sayaka-san has gone off somewhere to train secretly with Kojiro.

26
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,790
If I let this chance slip...

27
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,500
it will be the biggest mistake of Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke's life!

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,270
Un, deux, trois!
it will be the biggest mistake of Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke's life!

29
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,470
Un, deux, trois!

30
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,970
Your "Swan Lake" is getting better and better!

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,350
Still not there. I need to win at the All-Japan tournament!

32
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,020
That way, I can go to Yugoslavia with Inokuma-san!

33
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,030
I guess I did mess up badly.

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,120
But I did so many interviews.

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,160
Why hasn't at least one company called back?

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,120
The Selected Judo Championship of Love

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,360
Thank you for waiting.

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,180
This train, Yamabiko #74, will be arriving in Tokyo.

39
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,100
Ueno. This is Ueno.

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,120
Thank you for riding with us.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,140
Matsuda.
Thank you for riding with us.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,310
Wanna get a cold one?

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,640
Sorry, today won't work.

44
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,640
Payday's coming up, and I'm out of cash.

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
Come on. We hardly go out anymore.

46
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,500
Wow, it says Inokuma Yawara's going to the Nationals!

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,570
And then it's on to the World Championships!

48
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,130
Yawara-chan's so cute!

49
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,800
Come along! It's not like you have a girl waiting at home.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,090
Lay off, willya?

51
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,350
Yes, this is <i>All Sports.</i>

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
D-Dad?

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,850
Sign: Chojuan Soba and Chinese

54
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,590
This is a surprise! You came without giving me a call.

55
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,780
Is something up?

56
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,830
Nope, nothing's happening. That's exactly why I came.

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,970
I came here because I don't see you getting yourself a woman.

58
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,340
Anyway...

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,840
Have a look.

60
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,390
Wh-What's this?

61
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,170
You know what it is.

62
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,580
She's a nice girl who works as an elementary school teacher in the next town.

63
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,230
When I told her family about you,
 they jumped at the idea.

64
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,100
N-Now wait a minute!

65
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,560
Haven't we discussed this before?

66
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,030
I already have a girl—

67
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,490
You mean Yawara-chan?

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,290
Didn't you say that Inokuma Yawara is the girl that's going to the Olympics?

69
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,040
Yeah.

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,500
Give it up, will you?

71
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
That's who she is, right?

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,170
She's bound to become a National Achievement Hero or something.




73
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,510
She's way out of the league of a third-rate reporter at a third-rate paper.

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,850
You're better off marrying some lovely, normal girl.

75
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,730
A man can't go without a girl forever.

76
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,810
Get yourself two kids, and you'll have a happy home even if you're poor.

77
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,780
Don't plan my life out for me.




78
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,780
Is that a problem?

79
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,780
Are you saying you made it with Inokuma Yawara?

80
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,060
Did you at least touch her boobs? Or even kiss her like this?

81
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,580
You're pretty frank, Dad.

82
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,760
So did you?! So? So?

83
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,510
W-Well...

84
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,930
See? She's not gonna give you a second look.

85
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,430
Now trust me, pair up with this girl here.

86
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,160
You're wrong!

87
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,400
We get along fine.

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,440
That's bull.

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm not lying!

90
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,720
Y-Yawara-san and I... we, you know... have an enviable relationship.

91
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,000
Then introduce her to me.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,170
I-I can't!



93
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,620
Sh-She's really busy right now.

94
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,670
M-Meeting you out of the blue would be a big shock!

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,630
Then I'll watch her from a distance.

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,460
I want to see just how close you two are.

97
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,140
If people really do envy your relationship, you can make it happen.

98
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,080
W-Well...

99
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,030
B-But...

100
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:27,570
F-Fujiko-san—

101
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,950
H-Hanazono-san—
F-Fujiko-san—

102
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,630
Wh-What is it?

103
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,650
No, you go first.

104
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,330
Nah, it's just that running early in the morning feels nice.

105
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,830
That's what I wanted to say!

106
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,870
The All-Japan Selected Judo Championships are coming up.

107
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,810
Yeah.

108
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,810
Hanazono-san, how do you feel before a match?

109
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,870
W-Well, I feel nervous about everything.

110
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,690
I think that every one of my opponents is at the top of his game.

111
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,820
I even wonder if there's anyone weaker than me.

112
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,540
So you get like that too.




113
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,830
All I know is that I'm scared, so scared.

114
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,750
Still, Fujiko-san, whenever I feel that way, I do this:

115
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm the strongest one here!

116
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,550
Want to try it?

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,890
I'm the strongest one here!

118
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,850
Shaddap!

119
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,200
Do you know what time it is? It's just dawn!

120
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,860
Sorry!

121
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,860
What is it, Matsuda-san?

122
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,360
Why did we need to talk?

123
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,410
U-Um... well, actually...

124
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,200
I didn't call you here for anything special.



125
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,130
Th-That's fine, right? We always meet up like this.

126
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,590
Always? You're usually doing a story when we meet.

127
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,340
Wait! W-Well...



128
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm so busy doing stories that I don't get to see you often.

129
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,100
What are you saying, Matsuda-san?

130
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,330
Are you okay, Matsuda-san?

131
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,530
Uh, yeah, just a little dizzy.

132
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,490
S-Speaking of that, how are you feeling before your match?

133
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,200
Fujiko-san's very excited, and she's improving at an incredible rate.

134
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,840
But aren't you excited too?

135
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,860
You'll be going to the All-Japan Selected Championships,

136
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,980
then the World Championships,

137
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,200
then you'll transfer straight to Saikai University.



138
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm not going to enter the World Championships, and I'm not going to Saikai University.

139
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,980
I'm only entering the coming tournament

140
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,020
because Grandpa said Fujiko-san would feel lonely.

141
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,770
You can't be...

142
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,230
I'm going to start working.

143
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,810
Work?

144
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,380
What about judo?

145
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,580
If you and Fujiko-san go to Saikai U,

146
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,450
Japanese judo will become much more riveting!

147
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,990
And that will make your articles more riveting, right?

148
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,950
N-No, I'm just saying...

149
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,470
I know that all you're interested in is a good story.

150
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,340
You don't care about what I feel.

151
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,460
Wh-What?

152
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,470
You're cute when you're angry. Just kidding.

153
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,890
What are you, dumb?

154
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,270
That's not going to change how I feel.

155
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm leaving.




156
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,650
H-Hey, wait!

157
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,760
Damn...

158
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,620
I-It's not easy going out with an independent girl.

159
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,620
You thought you could fool me?

160
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,000
What's with him? He only said that because he'd have fun covering it.

161
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,510
He never thinks about how I feel.

162
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,550
But what will I do if I can't find work?

Look, wake up and smell the coffee!

168
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,450
Marriage interviews were made for guys like you!

169
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,700
D-Don't make it sound like I can't get a girl.

170
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,160
Then what? You <i>can</i> get a girl?

171
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,710
Kosaku!



172
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,380
I've been looking for you everywhere.

173
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,940
The Chief is furious!

174
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,670
Wait, aren't you...

175
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,130
Oh my! Kosaku's father!

176
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,710
Oh, my heavens!

177
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,420
Kosaku, you should've told me your father was coming to visit!

178
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,960
I really wanted to meet him!

179
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,200
Let me go!

180
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,890
You two look like a very fine couple!

181
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,650
Kosaku, if you're with her, then I have no complaints!

182
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:29,200
K-Kosaku, are you meeting your father to discuss marriage?

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,260
Oh, Kuniko's so happy!

184
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,660
Y-You're wrong!
Oh, Kuniko's so happy!

185
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,500
N-No, I'm not!
You are!

186
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,670
Really?

187
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,170
Matsuda-san said that?



188
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,650
Well, that man is all about his job.

189
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,180
You don't look happy. What happened?

190
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,190
Oh, come now, are you still suspicious about me and Sayaka-san?

191
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,690
No, I...

192
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,650
I've told you this many times before.

193
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,320
That engagement was all Sayaka-san's idea.

194
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,230
I flatly refused her.

195
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,320
I'm just an employee of the Honami Group.

196
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,330
I was never able to see you because I was always on overseas business trips.



197
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,300
That comes with the important position I hold.

198
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,760
But my heart was yearning while I was away.

199
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,030
Ah, those were hard and sorrowful days.

200
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,480
Now then, let's have a quiz!

201
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,970
Who do you think I'm thinking about?

202
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,070
Yes, you're correct!

203
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,150
No, you don't look happy at all.

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,740
Um, this is Tsurukame Travel—

205
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,700
What? You're not getting any return calls from your interviews?

206
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,210
Yes, I interviewed four times, but no one's called back.

207
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,740
Strange indeed.


208
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,890
You're the flavor of the month.
 People should be fighting for you.

209
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,220
I guess I don't have any real talent.

210
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,130
No, there must be some mistake.

211
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,610
I'm sure you'll get some good responses.

212
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,120
Do you think so?

213
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,610
Still, Yawara-san... is working at a company the only future path?

214
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,130
For example, if there was someone who wanted to drink your café au lait every morning,

215
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,820
or someone who wanted to eat your freshly-baked cakes,

216
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,570
or someone who wanted to see your smile every day...

217
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,580
You mean a coffee shop?
 But that's just a part-time job.

218
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,940
Th-That's not what I meant!

219
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,890
Maybe I'm being a little too vague.

220
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,890
Yawara!

221
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,890
Y-Yes?

222
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,020
What in blazes are you dawdling for?
 Get your fanny to the dojo!

223
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,520
Right!

224
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,100
S-Son of a...

225
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,580
Master, a-actually this was...

226
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,860
Actually, I was showing Yawara-san some sparring techniques.

227
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,870
Kazamitori! 

228
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,530
Dang it! If you do anything to Yawara just 'cause you're near her,

229
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,370
you'll be hurting a lot more than this!

230
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,630
Got it?

231
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,760
Okay! I understand! Now let me go!

232
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,720
I swear, you're certainly more than stubborn.

233
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,470
I wonder where you get that from?

234
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,370
Listen, we're doing that marriage interview even if I have to drag you there myself!

235
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,900
Your mom's always going on about wanting grandchildren.  
Everyone else is wondering when there will be grandkids. 

236
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,280
Your mom's always going on about wanting grandchildren.  

237
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,480
She's so worried about you she gets nervous attacks all the time.  

238
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,740
Marriage is great! You get to eat right every day and get it on every night!

239
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,240
Pipe down and go to bed, will you? I still have work, you know!

240
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,130
Of course, Inokuma Yawara will show us her lovely moves

241
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,010
at the upcoming All-Japan Selected Tournament.

242
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,280
Inokuma's vivid and brilliant Ippon Zeoi will...

243
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,990
I found her! Here's our future superstar!

244
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,770
You did it, Yawara-san! You're finally debuting in an official match.

245
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,690
Incredible, Yawara-san! You're the national champ!

246
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
You have the greatest smile, Yawara-san!

247
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,180
Top: Finally the World!!
Right: Yawara in Free-Weight World Cup Tournament?!
You have the greatest smile, Yawara-san!

248
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,700
Top: Finally the World!!
Right: Yawara in Free-Weight World Cup Tournament?!

249
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,500
It's the beginning of the World Cup. Yawara of Japan, aim for the world!

250
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,640
Congratulations, Yawara-san! You're finally the world champ!

251
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,800
You really are my superstar!

252
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,020
You dumb mug.





253
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,000
Sorry, Hanazono-san, for making you come with me every morning.

254
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,510
O-Oh, don't worry.

255
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,510
In any case, the All-Japan Selected is tomorrow.

256
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,510
Yeah.

257
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,520
When I first saw Inokuma play judo, I was thrilled from the bottom of my heart.

258
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,020
She used her tiny body to flip bigger opponents one after the other.

259
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,090
But I didn't feel that I could never do what she was doing.





260
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,030
Seeing her gave me the confidence that I can do anything if I try!

261
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,550
I know!

262
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,030
I had no goals after quitting ballet.

263
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,540
I had no pride, and I didn't know what to do, until I met Inokuma-san.

264
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,040
Thanks to Inokuma-san, I feel that I can accomplish anything!

265
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,540
Let's give it our all, for Inokuma's sake!

266
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes!

267
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,970
I will win next year's Japan Judo Championships, dammit!

268
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,540
Y-You're sweating a lot!

269
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,640
Here's my towel.

270
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,040
Fujiko-san's scent!

271
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,930
A-Are you okay?






272
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,610
Hanazono-san, your face is crimson!

273
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,580
Th-This is the latest I've ever been!

274
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,980
Dad?

275
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,750
What to do?

276
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
What to do?

277
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,240
Yawara-san, Kosaku has fallen deeply for you!

278
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,810
Is there any way you can show him some pity?

279
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,310
Hm, maybe I'm getting too far ahead of myself?

280
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,600
Forgive me!

281
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,160
It's okay.

282
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,370
Thank you.

283
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,580
You must be Inokuma Yawara-san, right?

284
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,590
Yes.

285
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,010
I'm Kosaku's...

286
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,840
Yawara-chan!
I'm Kosaku's...

287
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,180
Um...

288
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,990
Oh, the thing is my son is a big fan of yours.

289
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:34,480
Every time you win a match,
 he practically turns cartwheels.

290
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,450
Please do your best in tomorrow's tournament, for that idiot son of mine.

291
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,450
I will. Thank you very much!

292
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,090
Who's that old fart?

293
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,480
He looks like a lecher.

294
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,000
Did he do anything to you, Inokuma-san?

295
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,640
Did he touch your butt?

296
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,120
No, he didn't.

297
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,700
But he's been wandering around here for a while now.

298
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,760
He's definitely a peeping tom!

299
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,390
Or maybe he's a thief?

300
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,160
No, he's not. I feel that he's very kind.

301
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,970
You're kidding!

302
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,110
God, he's still looking over here!

303
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,170
I'm scared!
God, he's still looking over here!

304
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,480
Should I toss him?

305
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,980
Matsuda.
Sign: All Sports News

306
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,070
I heard the big news!

307
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,110
A-About what?

308
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,070
That you got your dad's permission to marry Kuni-chan, of course!

309
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,680
Peace!

310
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,080
N-No! That's a total mistake!

311
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,170
Don't try to hide it!

312
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,550
"When I say 'No,' I actually mean 'Yes'!"

313
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,960
You only acted like you wanted nothing to do with her, you horndog!

314
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,960
I'm telling you that you're wrong!

315
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,570
Hi, this is <i>All Sports News.</i> Dad?

316
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,820
Where were you this morning?

317
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,680
You're leaving?

318
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,880
Come on.

319
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,520
But you don't have to leave.

320
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,180
At least you could do some sightseeing around Tokyo.

321
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,190
Though I'm not doing a marriage interview.

322
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,590
I can't afford to do that.

323
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,680
If I don't give your mom massages, her nervous attacks won't subside.

324
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:18,250
I thought Yawara-chan would be unfriendly because she's famous, but she's actually sweet.

325
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,870
Dad! Don't tell me you met Yawara-san!

326
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,800
Relax, I didn't say anything out of bounds.

327
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,430
What's to be done? You can keep doing what you want.




328
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,160
If you're serious about her, then go after her!

329
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,450
You need persistence to win at love!

330
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,470
Dad.

331
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,420
There it is! Her deadly "Nutcracker"!

332
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,720
Yay!

333
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,200
Wow, that was awesome, Fujiko-san!

334
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,900
Fools!
Wow, that was awesome, Fujiko-san!

335
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,170
That was just dumb luck!

336
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,340
Now get back to practicing!

337
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,520
Okay!

338
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,840
The way you've helped her improve in such a short time is truly masterful!

339
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,010
Fujiko-san's efforts and my coaching can't compare to your expert instruction!

340
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,960
Once again I, Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke, bow my head to you!

341
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,650
Oh you, but you still ain't getting Yawara.



342
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:40,640
Still, Beanpole has improved a lot thanks to my superior instruction.

343
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,960
I can't wait to see her in action...

344
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,920
at tomorrow's All-Japan!

345
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,930
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 383 Days

346
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,930
Yawara!

347
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,650
Beanpole is all fired up about the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships,

348
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,920
so what's your deal?!

349
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,150
I can't believe no one has called me back.

350
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,400
Relax, everything will fall into place.

351
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,480
Grandpa, did you do something behind my back again?

352
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,940
Actually, there was a call from Something-or-Other Travel.

353
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,280
What?

354
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,370
Yawara!

355
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,580
<b>I'm So Mad<i>!!
I'm So Mad!!</b></i>

356
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,510
You'll be getting my Harai Goshi if you don't watch!
<b>I'm So Mad<i>!!</b></i>

357
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,920
<b>I'm So Mad<i>!!</b></i>

358
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:38,810
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth

359
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,980
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru

360
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,620
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.
hitonami no kousaten senaka osarenagara

361
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:03,880
We climb an endless hill, just you and me.
sakamichi wo doko made mo anata to aruita

362
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:13,180
I want to say "I love you" to the one I truly want,
naze hoshii mono wo "daisuki" to

363
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:20,520
But why can I not? I really don't know.
koe ni dashite ienai no?

364
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,270
You're standing here by my side.
ima anata ga iru

365
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:36,490
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.
tada sore dake de yasuragu kimochi

366
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,500
"Please don't let go of the hand you're holding,"
"tsunaideru sono yubi wo hanasanaide..."

367
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,880
I say as I look for your smile.
egao wo sagashite
