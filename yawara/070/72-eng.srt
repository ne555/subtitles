1
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,660
Ippon! Done!

2
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:53,670
Will It Happen<i>?!</i>
 Five Straight Miraculous Wins

3
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,000
She's done it! Inokuma Yawara surges ahead with two wins!

4
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,010
Yay!


5
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,890
Inokuma-san, you're brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!

6
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,810
Inokuma!

7
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,790
All right!

8
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,460
Neither Tsukushi U's lead player, Ogaki,

9
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,710
nor their second player, Kurokawa,

10
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,350
had the slightest chance to show their judo skills!

11
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,030
Will Inokuma win all five this quickly?

12
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,430
Coach, forgive me!


13
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,040
What are you saying? The match is still young!

14
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,580
But...

15
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,300
Inokuma's judo is so fast it's scary!

16
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,720
I-I know that!

17
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,810
If she's got the speed, we've got the power!

18
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,500
Listen!


19
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,160
She's the one on the ropes!

20
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,530
We still have three more players, so relax and crush her!

21
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,060
So, what does our color commentator Saito-san think?

22
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,800
She's now facing her third opponent.

23
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,540
Yes, she still has a ways to go.

24
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,540
Tsukushi's third and fourth players are both heavyweights.

25
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,050
Can even <i>the</i> Inokuma withstand that challenge?

26
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,990
Here she is, Tsukushi U's third player, the heavy battle tank, Uzaki Megumi!

27
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,260
Sh-She scares me!

28
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,770
Inokuma-san!




29
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,880
You got it, Uzaki?

30
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,180
The tides of war are now in our favor!

31
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,820
Her weight class is 48 kg and below!

32
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,780
She's such a lightweight you can blow her away!

33
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,970
Now show her what real heavyweight judo looks like!

34
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,040
Right!

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,790
Now we have a 72 kg super-heavyweight vs. a 48 kg-and-below flyweight.

36
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,530
How will Inokuma handle this stark weight difference?

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,170
Sh-She'll be killed!

38
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,900
D-Don't be stupid! This is sports. Nobody gets killed in sports!

39
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,560
Then she'll end up in traction!

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,520
Hajime!

41
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,900
Uzaki grabs Inokuma as she watches warily for her Ippon Zeoi!




42
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,690
But take a look, folks!

43
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,080
From this angle, our view of Inokuma is completely blocked!

44
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,210
Inokuma has completely disappeared!

45
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,160
Here it is!

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,250
Her Ippon Zeoi!

47
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,160
Resist it!

48
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,740
She fends it off! Usaki desperately holds on!


49
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,430
Ah, now she's going for an Osaekomi!

50
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,820
That's right! Flip her over and crush her!

51
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,980
Don't let her get away!

52
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,480
Don't!

53
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,410
Jougai! Mate!

54
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,890
Wow, a close call for Inokuma!

55
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,840
Nobody can withstand an Osaekomi from Uzaki's huge frame!

56
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,370
There's no way Inokuma Yawara will lose to a pin hold.

57
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,550
She's able to do all those standing throws because she doesn't worry about pins.

58
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,530
I see.

59
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,580
Master Inokuma.

60
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,710
Her opponent plans to use her brute strength to pin her down.

61
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,820
She can do what she wants.





62
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,280
Strength doesn't work against my judo.

63
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,360
Yes, get her again!

64
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,660
Throw her down!

65
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,130
Oh, it's Inokuma's Osoto!

66
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,300
Yuko!

67
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,800
It's a Yuko, but...

68
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,110
She's going for another pin hold!

69
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,760
Yes! We got her!

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
Don't!

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,770
She'll lose!

72
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,850
Inokuma's in danger!

73
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,730
Wh-What?

74
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,910
Inokuma's got her in a Kami Shihoh Gatame!

75
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,540
Impossible!

76
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,900
No way!

77
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,590
W-Wow!

78
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,060
However, will the difference in physiques allow for an Osaekomi?

79
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,530
Stop kidding around, Uzaki!



80
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,010
Quit napping and get up!

81
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,830
Five seconds in!

82
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,990
Come on, just flick her off and get up, you joker!

83
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,770
Ten seconds in!

84
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,970
Fifteen seconds!

85
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,000
Dumbass, get the hell up! Why are you lying down?!

86
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,090
Wh-Why isn't Uzaki getting up?


87
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,460
It's not that she won't get up, she <i>can't</i> get up.

88
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,610
I remember back in high school,

89
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,250
during our match with Ganryuji High,

90
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,180
Inokuma did the same Kami Shihoh Gatame on Sasaki,

91
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,380
who'd finished third in the Men's National High School Tournament.

92
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,480
O-On a guy?!

93
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,160
Saito-san, isn't she able to get up?

94
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,300
No.

95
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,530
She has her in a perfectly tight hold.

96
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,560
She's holding her head between her knees.

97
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,050
They're both pressed against each other's chests.

98
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,640
Their chests are pressed together very tightly...

99
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,000
Saito-san, you're beet red, you know.

100
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,500
Please, don't say that!

101
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,930
Get up! Get up, Uzaki!

102
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,060
Ippon!

103
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,110
Done!

104
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,760
Coach!

105
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,890
I have to say, who would've predicted this?

106
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,560
The petite Inokuma pulled an Osaekomi Ippon on the giant, Uzaki!

107
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,620
Yay! You did it!

108
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,560
You're incredible, Yawara-chan!

109
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,750
You're totally cool!


110
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,750
You pinned down that large woman even though you're so small?

111
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,540
Kyonkyon.


112
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,510
So anyone can become that strong?

113
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,970
F-Forgive me, Coach.

114
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,490
I, of all people, lost to a pin hold!

115
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,740
No, this is still going according to plan!

116
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,540
B-But Coach...


117
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,510
Quit sounding pathetic!

118
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,250
Uzaki wore her out, just as I planned!

119
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,900
Easy as pie!

120
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,300
Are you sure?

121
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,680
Playtime's over.

122
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,930
I'm putting an end to this.

123
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,170
Yes, that's right!

124
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,900
You said it, Katori! That's what makes you the national champ!

125
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,270
Now show her who's boss!

126
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,910
Vice Captain Katori Shinobu finally makes her appearance!

127
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,120
She's the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships titleholder.

128
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,080
Up till now, no one's been able to outclass Katori Shinobu in power and technique!

129
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,300
Master, here she comes.

130
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,940
Katori Shinobu represents a real obstacle!




131
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,930
For crying out loud, all she's been facing are impressive-sounding titles.

132
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,920
No, what I'm saying is true!

133
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,100
Katori is reallyâ€”

134
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,370
This is bad.



135
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,900
Did you break a geta strap or something?

136
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,360
No, I broke the band on my underwear.

137
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,660
Did you gain more weight?

138
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,380
And here's her fourth opponent, Vice Captain Katori Shinobu!

139
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,670
But even Inokuma has to feel fatigued after beating three of them!

140
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,220
All according to plan!

141
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,230
Hajime!



142
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,250
Master, I have a bad feeling about this fight.

143
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,610
Why are you looking worried? 

144
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,320
Oh! Yutenji, take a look!

145
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,690
An upright tea stalk!

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,100
Good luck, Inokuma-san!

150
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,410
Fujiko-san!

151
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,660
What are you guys doing?! Cheer her on!

152
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,320
Yeah, you're right!

153
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:57,740
Fight her!

154
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,410
You can do it!
Fight her!

155
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,690
Guys...

156
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,990
Inokuma's fast!

157
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,870
She dives for the chest lapel!

158
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,960
But Katori pulls her along, checking Inokuma's moves!

159
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,090
Quit lollygagging! Do your move!

160
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,460
Don't give her a breather!

161
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,270
Inokuma's Kouchi Gari!

162
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,300
Katori holds on!

163
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,180
Don't be intimidated! She's coming with an Ippon Zeoi!

164
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,530
I love that look in her eyes.

165
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,390
It surpasses the one she had during the World Cup.

166
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,510
Yeah, it's the same look as back then.

167
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,530
Back then?

168
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,540
Back when she fought Jody.



169
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,060
When Yawara-san fights for real,
 she's in her element like a fish in water.

170
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,260
This is the true Yawara-san!

171
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,330
I appears that we'll have to fight for real as well.

172
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,850
Stick out your belly and get out of there!

173
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,530
What just happened? Inokuma fell!

174
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
It looks like Inokuma has run out of stamina!

175
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,380
I slipped on some sweat!

176
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,450
Get her, Katori!

177
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,200
Goodness, she flipped her over!

178
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,250
Inokuma's goose is cooked!

179
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,090
When my underwear band snapped, is this what it was predicting?

180
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,140
Quit being discombobulated over your undies!

181
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,710
Take a good look at this!

182
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,720
There are now two upright tea stalks!

183
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,860
Inokuma-san!

184
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,470
Inokuma-san!
Inokuma-san!

185
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,180
Yawara-chan!

186
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,080
Hang in there!



187
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,190
Hold on!

188
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,200
We've finally toppled Inokuma Yawara!

189
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,720
Move forward, Katori!

190
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,910
Thrust out your arm and go forward!

191
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,470
What's with Katori? She literally ran away from her chance to win!

192
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,170
S-So just now...

193
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,720
A Hiza Gatame.

194
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,170
A Hiza Gatame?

195
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,140
Yes.



196
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,900
When Katori was about to do an Osaekomi,

197
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,230
Inokuma was going for an Ude Hishigi Hiza Gatame. 

198
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,490
If Katori hadn't moved forward and had instead tried to pull her arm backwards,

199
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,510
she would've been caught in a perfect hold.

200
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,830
Inokuma Yawara... you switch your moves so quickly.

201
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,170
But...



202
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,720
Now Katori is trying to make some kind of breakthrough!

203
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,960
Inokuma-san!

204
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,050
Get her!

205
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,500
Fight her!

206
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,810
Go! Go!

207
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,040
Fujiko-san...

208
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,760
Paddyfield...

209
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,500
Yoshinagawa-san...

210
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,920
Marilyn...

211
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,990
Kyonkyon...

212
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,060
It's Katori with a Koshi Guruma! Inokuma fends it off!

213
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,610
Katori segues into an Uchi Mata!

214
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,110
Ippon!

215
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,370
Done!



216
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,970
Holy cow! Holy cow, Inokuma Yawara!

217
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,530
She deftly turned an Uchi Mata into a Tai Otoshi Ippon!

218
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,510
Inokuma-san!

219
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,300
Yawara-chan!

220
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,360
Inokuma-san, you're so incredible!

221
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,640
Coach!

222
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,180
All according to plan!



223
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,590
How's that according to plan?!

224
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,230
She defeated four of us... all with Ippons!

225
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,590
How? How?!


226
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,310
Going for a standing throw is too risky.

227
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,600
And going for an Osaekomi would just be inviting trouble.

228
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,570
Yamada! I almost forgot you're still here!

229
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,660
There's no way you can lose!

230
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,130
It's still all according to plan, isn't that right? Right?

231
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,950
Okay.

232
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,240
Yamada!

233
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,630
Yamada.

234
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,620
Coach.

235
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,630
I won't let her get five.


236
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,810
I promise you.

237
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,430
Ya... Yamada!

238
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,610
Yeah, it ain't over yet!

239
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,680
All according to plan!

240
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,220
Yes, we're finally down to the fifth player!

241
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,190
The woman who has led Japanese women's judo for ten years,

242
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,020
the female Sanshiro, Yamada Kaori! 

243
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,300
Saito-san! She's finally showed up to compete.

244
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,100
Yes. But Yawara still has a lot of will.


245
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,120
Now the problem is Inokuma's fatigue.

246
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,370
My judo doesn't leave one tired!

247
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,700
M-Master Inokuma Jigoro?

248
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,340
Yes, that's me.

249
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,620
My judo doesn't require a lot of strength.

250
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,450
It won't leave you fatigued after beating five or even ten opponents!

251
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,640
Master!

252
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,010
It's been a while, Master!

253
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,190
Oh, Saito! You've been eating that yakiniku?

254
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,180
Isn't that the World Cup gold medal?


255
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,950
I can't believe you're walking around wearing something so precious!

256
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,650
I'll get dozens more of these!

257
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,410
In Barcelona!

258
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,420
Did you all hear that?

259
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,330
Master Jigoro has proclaimed certain victory in Barcelona!



260
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,340
Okay, I'm going.

261
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,330
Inokuma-san.

262
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,810
Yawara-chan!

263
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,680
Inokuma-san, thank you.

264
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,980
Kyonkyon...

265
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,600
I...

266
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,800
I thought I'd never amount to anything.

267
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,240
But when I watch you, I... I...

268
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,900
I feel that I can also achieve something.

269
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,000
Inokuma-san, thank you!

270
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,250
No, I should be the one thanking you.

271
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,000
Guys, I really want to thank you.

272
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,290
I've never been so excited to play judo or had so much fun!

273
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,950
Okay, I'll be be back soon.

274
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,300
Be careful out there, Inokuma-san.

275
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,700
I hope you don't get hurt.

276
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,320
Mm-hmm!


277
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,370
Now, laugh or cry, there's only one!

278
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,380
But the last one standing in her way is the female Sanshiro, Yamada Kaori!

279
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,710
Indeed, this fight will determine who will dominate Japanese women's judo!

280
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,840
Yamada! Show her why Tsukushi U is number one in judo!

281
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
Yamada won't lose.




282
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,220
Yamada has a secret weapon against her Ippon Zeoi.

283
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,570
I sparred with her for many hours so she could hone it.

284
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,140
Inokuma always grabs the right sleeve with her left hand whenever she goes for an Ippon Zeoi.

285
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,410
And when she does...



286
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,380
Yamada will win with an Ude Garami!

287
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,080
Yamada Kaori has something up her sleeve.

288
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,100
Yeah.


289
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,630
So will the winner of the Ajisai Cup Intermural Women's Tournament

290
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,570
be five-time champs Tsukushi U?

291
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,550
Or will it be the white belts of Mitsuba Women's Junior College?

292
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,030
Hajime!


293
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,570
Come on!

294
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,070
Inokuma Yawara!

295
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,840
Here it comes!

296
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,620
Ude Garami...

297
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,210
I've got her!

298
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,710
She switched from a right Ippon Zeoi to the left? So fast!

299
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,660
Ippon! Done!

300
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,540
Inokuma defeats five opponents!

301
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,320
Mitsuba Women's Junior College has won!

302
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,910
Guys!

303
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,940
Incredible! Inokuma Yawara is the very definition of "incredible"!

304
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,410
The round ended before it began,
 with a truly lightning-fast Ippon Zeoi!

305
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,250
Inokuma Yawara knocked off Yamada Kaori

306
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,990
to take her place at the top of Japanese women's judo!


307
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,730
Will you be able to keep up with me?

308
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,130
I'm asking if you'll be able to keep up with my training?

309
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,180
Inokuma-san!

310
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 404 Days

311
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,760
Dad was watching, wasn't he?

312
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,160
Don't get a swelled head just because you won that worthless tournament, Yawara.

313
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,020
Ah, I have to think about my future plans.

314
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,410
Don't worry about your plans.



315
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,420
Leave everything to me, and a rainbow-colored future awaits you.

316
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,740
I wonder if everyone knows where they'll be working?

317
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,180
Yawara!

318
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,740
Inokuma Kojiro on the Move!

319
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,870
<b>Inokuma Kojiro on the Move<i>!
Inokuma Kojiro on the Move!</b></i>

320
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,980

<b>Inokuma Kojiro on the Move<i>!</b></i>
