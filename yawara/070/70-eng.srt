00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,410
I've loved him.

I've always been waiting.

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,170
I showed off whenever he was around.

But I acted cool, like I didn't care.

My career and love life?

I do think they're both important.

But when I see his smile,

00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,150
I know it's what I want the most.

He proposed to me; was it real?

I feel like I'm stuck in a crosswalk.

It's so unbelievable.

As you and I see each other, eye to eye.

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,030
Another Uchi Mata!

22
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,410
Are you clear?

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,120
You should really watch out for Ito Fujiko,

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,530
especially her Ouchi Gari.

25
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,500
Just one more before I face Inokuma Yawara.

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,590
Listen to me, Sayaka-san!

27
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,320
Soon we'll settle everything!

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,170
Sayaka-san!

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,870
Good luck, Fujiko-san!

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,520
Fight her!

31
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,720
S-Sorry if I lose in an instant!

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,770
Keep fighting, Fujiko-san!

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,770
Just one more.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Bow!

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:27,580
Get Out of My Way<i>!</i>

36
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,880
Now, here comes the juggernaut of the tournament, Ito Fujiko!

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,410
The cheers are growing louder!

38
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,090
Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma!
The cheers are growing louder!

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:39,500
Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma!

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,030
However, these cheers are in anticipation
Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma!

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,100
of a match between Honami Sayaka and Inokuma Yawara!
Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma! Inokuma!

42
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,370
Beanpole, take a fall, any fall!

43
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,570
We're here to see Inokuma take on Honami!

44
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,070
Please lose!

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,500
Bastards! Why are you telling her to lose?!

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,410
What the hell is my daughter to you?!

47
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,990
She's a prima donna! 

48
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,950
Prima donburi?



49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,110
I know I'm going to lose anyway.

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,270
But I won't lose without a fight.

51
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,970
I need to wear her out at least,
 then pass her on to Inokuma-san!

52
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,420
Hajime!

53
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,980
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,260
Just one more.

55
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,700
Just one more!

56
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,470
Just you wait, Inokuma Yawara!

57
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,420
Un, deux, trois.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
I just need to take care of this obstacle!

59
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,090
Un, deux...

60
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,590
Get away, Sayaka-san!

61
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,530
Trois!

62
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,100
Waza Ari!

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,840
Incredible, a Waza Ari!

64
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,810
Ito's Ouchi Gari got her a Waza Ari!

65
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,430
You're awesome, Fujiko-san!

66
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,150
Take that!

67
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,690
Honami Sayaka is in a state of shock!

68
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,110
That's the ugly truth, Miss.

69
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,380
H-Has milady...

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,660
She's still in it. Now quick, to the arena.

71
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,080
O-Of course. Milady!

72
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,470
P-Perhaps Yawara-san won't even be in tomorrow's headlines!

73
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,270
How about "Inokuma Jigoro's Superb Coaching!" above and below the fold?

74
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,990
We've come to an unexpected development!

75
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,610
Who would've ever predicted that Honami would be on the defensive?

76
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,280
I was just a little unfocused.

77
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,330
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.

78
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,580
It's time for you to get out of my way!

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,330
U-Un, deux...

80
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,290
Now!

81
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,330
Trois!

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,710
There she goes!

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,630
There it is, Ito's Ouchi Gari!

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,580
And it's Honami who literally fell on her back!

85
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,890
Fujiko!

86
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,180
I'm so moved!

87
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,180
She got her.

88
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,480
All right!

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,140
Fujiko-san!
All right!

90
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,250
J-Jougai.


91
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,330
The referee has declared it a Jougai!

92
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,660
Jougai! Mate!

93
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,550
Ito Fujiko was so close.

94
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,840
Her feet were slightly out of bounds when she did her Ouchi Gari.

95
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,130
That means Honami Sayaka has narrowly escaped a loss!

96
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,170
No way! Fujiko should've won that, right, honey?

97
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,810
That's right! Although I don't quite understand.

98
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,670
There's no need to worry.




99
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,590
Fujiko-san already has a Waza Ari, and as you can see, she's overpowering Honami.

100
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,300
So please relax,

101
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,020
Mother, Father.

102
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,590
"Mother"? "Father"?

103
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,550
Don't call us that!

104
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,870
O-Okay...

105
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,930
Ah, thank God!

106
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,120
I thought we weren't gonna see Honami and Inokuma face each other.

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,790
Don't give up, Sayaka-san!

108
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,440
Just keep going till you get to Inokuma!

109
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,710
Yeah! Yeah!

110
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,790
Sayaka! Sayaka!

111
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,440
Cut that out, you people!

112
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,130
Our daughter is fighting for her life out there, why?

113
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,350
Sayaka! Sayaka!

114
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,640
Now that Honami's down a Waza Ari, how is she going to counter?

115
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,100
Only three minutes left!

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,650
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!
Only three minutes left!

117
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,150
And the whole arena's shouting out Sayaka's name!
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

118
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,500
That's as it should be,
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

119
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,180
because most of the crowd has come to see a match between Honami and Inokuma!
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

120
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,990
Sayaka! Sayaka!

121
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,930
They won't see the star player that easy!
Sayaka! Sayaka!

122
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,470
Simply magnificent, Master Inokuma Jigoro! 
Sayaka! Sayaka!

123
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,710
Simply magnificent, Master Inokuma Jigoro! 

124
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,800
Coach Yutenji!

125
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,040
I can't believe she mastered that skill in such a short time!

126
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,460
I have once again come to recognize your greatness!

127
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,320
So you've come, have you? I see your face has gotten even bigger.

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Yes, glad to be here.

129
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,820
We at Saikai University will be facing Tsukushi University in the second semifinal match.




130
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,960
So that means your team's still winning those matches, correct?

131
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,240
Yes. But I'm afraid this year the Tsukushi University team is nearly unbeatable.

132
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,580
On the other hand, we at Saikai University still have a ways to go.

133
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,150
I still regret not being able to land Inokuma Yawara.

134
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,480
On top of that, there's that tall girl.

135
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,370
Her rhythm, her flexible body, the smoothness of her moves...





136
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,320
She's an amazing talent!


137
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,950
And you discovered that talent and used your expertise to train her!

138
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,710
It's enough to make me kowtow to you!

139
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,770
You're quite the silver-tongued devil!

140
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,600
Here, take one, Yutenji.

141
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,710
Yes, allow me to partake.

142
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,730
Still, will having Yawara-san on our team remain just a dream?

143
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,330
You can have her.

144
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,830
I'll let you have her.

145
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,470
Hey, that's unfair!

146
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,970
You're taking that Waza Ari and running out the clock, aren't you?

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,470
Don't let her grab you, Fujiko-san! Watch out for her Uchi Mata!

148
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,470
Fujiko-san, her Uchi Mata!

149
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,480
Inokuma Yawara!

150
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,730
Another Uchi Mata?!





151
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,020
Pull up your left foot!

152
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,860
Incredible, she avoided it!

153
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,360
Jougai!

154
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,340
Honami is desperate to make up for that Waza Ari!

155
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,400
Yes.

156
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,830
But she does need to be careful here.

157
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,060
Sayaka-san, don't rush it!

158
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,790
If you do, your moves won't be decisive!

159
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:34,840
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

160
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,030
Those are loud cheers.

161
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,300
I won't be able to avoid her forever anyway.

162
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,520
No matter what, I need to wear her out!

163
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,640
Hajime!

164
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,970
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

165
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,030
Give it your all today! Your mother will allow it!

166
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,910
Her parents once wanted to cancel the match.

167
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,590
You did it, Fujiko-san!

168
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,110
We have your parents' approval!

169
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,510
Hold it! I still don't approve of Fujiko associating with you!

170
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,040
O-Of course.

171
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,620
Did you just say I can have Yawara-san?

172
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,880
Yes, you can have her.

173
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,470
Plus you can also have Beanpole as a bonus.

174
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,910
Two for one, whaddaya think? Can't beat that, can ya?

175
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,750
H-Hey, wait! What are you trying to say?

176
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,140
Yawara-san and Fujiko-san are still enrolled in MWJC.


177
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,190
You caught that, you media jackal?

178
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,240
That's right, those two are in their second year of <i>junior</i> college.

179
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,500
And they still haven't decided what they plan to do next.

180
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,540
You're not saying...

181
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,260
You're sending them to Saikai University?

182
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,220
Fujiko-san! Grab her back collar and lower your stance!

183
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,520
Oh no you don't!

184
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,760
You damned obstacle!

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,020
Trap her feet!

186
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,050
How long are you going to stand in my way?

187
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,760
It's not you I want to fight!

188
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,470
My only real opponent is...

189
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,320
Fujiko-san, it'll be all right!

190
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,340
Inokuma Yawara!

191
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,810
Fujiko-san, hold on just a little longer!

192
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,510
Fujiko-san!

193
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,140
He's... sending Yawara-san to Saikai University?

194
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,990
Fujiko-san!

198
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,440
Milady, hold on!

199
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,820
Tokunaga-san, have some salmon roe and relax, willya?

200
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,320
I wouldn't be able to swallow that!

201
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,060
Not when Milady is in a hard fight!

202
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,010
Then I'll have some.

203
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,290
A hard fight? I knew that before it began.

204
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,040
Just be thankful you didn't get beaten by an Ippon.

205
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,330
Milady, I'm coming for you!



206
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,950
Now don't be so impatient.

207
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,490
Here's some mackerel. It's good.

208
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,310
Less than a minute remaining in the match!

209
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,800
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!
Will that Waza Ari lead to Honami's loss?

210
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,470
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

211
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,860
Yawara! Yawara! Yawara!
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

212
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,860
The crowd is chanting both Sayaka and Yawara's names!
Yawara! Yawara! Yawara!
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

213
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,420
But at this rate, MWJC will win without the aid of Yawara!

214
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,560
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!
But at this rate, MWJC will win without the aid of Yawara!

215
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,010
Sayaka! Sayaka! Sayaka!

216
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,160
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

217
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,380
Only 40 seconds left, Fujiko-san!
Fujiko! Fujiko! Fujiko!

218
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,740
Come on, you're almost there!

219
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,330
Fujiko-san's so amazing!

220
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,010
She's so cool!

221
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,990
You can do anything if you work hard for it.

222
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,310
It's still anybody's match. She mustn't let her guard down.

223
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,310
She's still facing Sayaka-san.

224
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,930
She's so close. I can practically reach her!

225
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,360
Inokuma Yawara!

226
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,050
Why should I work myself into a sweat over this?

227
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,660
It's so I can topple Inokuma Yawara!

228
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,620
I won't let this opponent get in my way!

229
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,830
I said you will <i>not</i> get in my way!

230
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,840
Waza Ari!

231
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,710
It's a Waza Ari!

232
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:50,600
Honami switched from an Uchi Mata to an Ouchi Gari to get a Waza Ari!

233
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,180
Only twenty seconds left on the clock!



234
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,940
Now both players have a Waza Ari! It's all tied up!

235
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,860
Oh, wait a minute! She's in danger!

236
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,360
Get away, Fujiko-san!

237
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh, Honami takes an arm!
 Is she going for a joint lock?!

238
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,330
Or is she going to turn her over and go for an Osaekomi?

239
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,830
She can score an Osaekomi even with one second remaining!

240
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,440
What are you doing to Fujiko?


241
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,590
Stop this!

242
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,840
Only ten seconds left! Get away!

243
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,830
Come on, just a little more!

244
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,300
Ah, she's got her!

245
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,840
Eight seconds left!

246
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,170
Seven... six... five...

247
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,810
Get out of my way!

248
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,560
Oh, she's trying to turn her over! Ito Fujiko's in trouble!

249
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,270
Fujiko!

250
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,170
Don't give in!

251
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,320
Honami flipped her over!

252
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,820
Fujiko-san!

253
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,790
Honami's going for an Osaekomi!

254
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,750
Wait! Ito avoids it by entangling her legs!

255
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,400
Even now, you're still trying to obstruct my rematch with Inokuma Yawara?!

256
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,170
I'm done!

257
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,720
Done!

258
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,180
The clock's run out!

259
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,720
Honami did not get an Osaekomi!

260
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,480
It's over!


261
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,640
All right! You held her off, Fujiko-san!

262
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,180
Fujiko!

263
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,800
Is it over? What happened? Did Fujiko win?

264
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,900
Of course she did.

265
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,760
Fujiko-san most certainly won,

266
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,250
Mother, Father!

267
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,030
Stop calling us "Mother" and "Father"!

268
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,270
We've seen something truly incredible!

269
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,660
The Herculean match between the Seishin Women's School's captain,

270
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,270
Honami Sayaka, and MWJC's vice captain, Ito Fujiko,

271
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,430
has now come down to a referee's decision!

272
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,550
Will it be a stunning upset?

273
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,520
Or will Honami Sayaka prevail, leading to a face-off with her fellow captain, Inokuma Yawara?

274
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,090
Both players have a Waza Ari under their belts!

275
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,860
But in terms of total offensive moves, wouldn't Honami have the lead, Saito-san?

276
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,920
But Ito did have that Ouchi Gari at the beginning, even though it was ruled out of bounds.

277
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,530
That looked like an Ippon, and it must've left a very deep impression.





278
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,100
Honestly, that obstacle has caused me too much trouble.

279
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,040
In any case, my only objective is to fight Inokuma Yawara.

280
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Come, it's time for battle!

281
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,740
Fujiko-san's going to win, right, Inokuma-san?

282
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,100
You're darn right! Fujiko-san won any way you look at it!

283
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,930
That's right!

284
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,360
It'll be fine.

285
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,140
Don't worry.

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,650
Your calls!

287
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,880
It's one red and one white flag from the sub-refs!

288
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,160
So what's the head ref's decision?

289
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,160
It's a draw!

290
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,390
H-Holy cow, a draw!


291
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,490
Since the Seishin captain, Honami, received a draw, MWJC wins without their captain, Inokuma!

292
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,720
Yay!

293
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,110
There will be no rematch between Honami and Inokuma!

294
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,770
What did you say?!

295
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,370
Have you gone blind? Didn't you see all of my offensive moves?

296
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,730
Return to your position!

297
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,690
This isn't the time for that!

298
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,750
Honami simply won't accept the outcome!

299
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,350
The folks hoping for a Honami-Inokuma rematch are booing the call.

300
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,710
You could say Honami entered this tournament just for that rematch!

301
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,200
And she had it within her reach!




302
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,500
She fought all the way to Inokuma's presence, only to leave here with a draw!

303
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,460
It's time for you to bow!

304
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,090
I won't put up with this farce!

305
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,420
Your decision is invalid! Call a lawyer immediately!

306
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,670
It's time for you to bow!

307
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,340
Bow!



308
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,280
Honami exits!

309
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,450
Honami Sayaka is mortified!

310
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,280
It's regrettable, Sayaka-san.

311
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,340
Sayaka-san?

312
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,790
On the other hand, Ito Fujiko did marvelously!

313
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,220
She's truly an astonishing newcomer!

314
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,510
You did it!
She's truly an astonishing newcomer!

315
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,840
You did it!

316
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,860
Fujiko, well done!

317
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,840
She was such a timid girl.

318
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,150
That's really our daughter!

319
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,260
I'm so moved!

320
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,350
Fujiko-san, you're out of this world!

321
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,280
The trophy's ours at this rate!

322
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,690
You're incredible!

323
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,150
Fujiko-san!

324
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,240
Fujiko! What's wrong?!

325
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,860
Fujiko-san!

326
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,520
Hang in there, Fujiko-san!

327
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,030
Are you all right?

328
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,280
It hurts.

329
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,720
My left shoulder... hurts really bad.

330
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,440
Honami-san, a word...

331
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,790
Sorry about the way things turned out.

332
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,850
Milady...

333
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,400
"The Gentle Way Was Not Built in a Day," right?

334
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,820
Get in.

335
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,960
Okay, I've put it back.

336
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,490
Fujiko-san?

337
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,990
All you need now is my patented boiled newt medication to stop the pain.

338
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,880
Is our daughter Fujiko all right?

339
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,940
Sure, it's just a minor dislocation.

340
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,000
Dislocation?

341
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,820
Calm down. I put it back in place.

342
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,960
You put it back in place?

343
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,270
Fujiko, you poor dear!

344
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,730
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt as much now.

345
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,850
Master, will Fujiko-san be able to compete in the final round?

346
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,140
Don't be ridiculous!

347
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,180
Yes, it would be better if she doesn't.

348
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,690
She'll be shouldering the future of judo, so she needs to take care of that body.

349
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,780
She doesn't need to overwork herself for this rinky-dink tournament.

350
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,180
The future of judo?

351
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,030
She'll be shouldering that?

352
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,290
I-It's fine. I'll compete.

353
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,510
You mustn't overdo it.

354
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,790
A ballerina's body isn't soft!

355
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,260
Stop this, Fujiko!



356
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,420
Just leave everything to Inokuma Yawara-san!

357
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,110
I'm fine, honest!

358
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,440
Fujiko-san.

359
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,830
The result of the second semifinal match is in!

360
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,820
Tsukushi U's team advances!

361
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,600
What's more, they took care of Saikai University with just their first two players!

362
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,620
They're much stronger than when we saw them last time.

363
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,090
See?

364
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,460
I need to get out there and help out, Inokuma-san.


365
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,380
That's crazy, Fujiko-san.

366
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm telling you, I'm fine! Ow!

367
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,280
See?

368
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,930
Let us handle it, Fujiko-san!

369
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,440
You busted your hump out there!

370
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,670
It's time for us to step up!

371
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,190
Sh-She's right! It's time for us to carry our weight!

372
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,700
Paddyfield... Kyonkyon...

373
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,890
We'll wipe the floor with Tsukushi U!

374
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,150
You can also leave it to me!

375
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,080
So just watch, knowing we're in good hands.

376
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,730
Just don't be our albatross, okay?

377
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,690
What the heck? And we were just getting pumped up too!

378
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,300
Guys...

379
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,800
Yay!

380
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,390
All right, let's get out there and fight!

381
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,350
Yeah!

382
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,490
What? That beanpole hurt her shoulder and won't appear in the finals?

383
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,910
So it went from five versus two to five versus one, eh?

384
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,870
That means you five will crush Inokuma Yawara!

385
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,690
Yeah!

386
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,850
The Barcelona Olympics in 418 Days






387
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,740
Yawara, at last you've reached the finals of this stupid tournament.

388
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,480
It's not stupid! We'll fight hard and win the championship!

389
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,770
You know you can't treat those Tsukushi girls the same as your other opponents.

390
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,930
I know.

391
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:14,430
And since Beanpole ain't playing, you might be out there quicker than you thought.

392
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,300
Yawara!

393
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,700
The Lightning-Fast Ippon Zeoi.

394

You'll get my Harai Goshi if you don't watch.

397
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:31,690
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.

398
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:38,600
tasogare ni maiorita kokoro no labyrinth
At twilight, my heart gently falls into a labyrinth.

399
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,520
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,940
tokimeki to setsunasa ga mawari hajimeteru
Thrills and sorrows swirl around me.

401
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,530
We're pushed and shoved as we cross the street.

We climb an endless hill, just you and me.

But why can I not? I really don't know.

You're standing here by my side.

406
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:36,370
That fact alone puts my worries to rest.

I say as I look for your smile.
