1
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,570
A-An Osaekomi!

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,490
Now this is exhilarating!

3
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,160
This is no time to be amused. That won't hold her for long!

4
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,630
Please, don't struggle! Let me go to Yugoslavia!</i>

5
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,180
Let me go with Inokuma-san!</i>

6
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:05,180
A Smiling Ippon Zeoi<i>!</i>

7
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,980
What's the hell's that?

8
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,930
Is that even an Osaekomi?

9
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,420
She'll break it easily!

10
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
Ito Fujiko's now trying some kind of Osaekomi!



11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,450
She's desperately squeezing both of Yumioka's arms!

12
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,160
This is nuts. That Osaekomi can be countered easily.

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,950
Do what you have to do! Just don't let go of her!

14
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,960
Oh, no! Fujiko-san, if she pulls her arm out, she'll break your hold!

15
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,960
I don't know what's going on!

16
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,460
There's... no time left!



17
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,610
There's no time left in this four minute match.</i>

18
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,940
But because Ito Fujiko's maintaining her Osaekomi, the match must continue!</i>

19
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,440
Fujiko-san, hang on! Just fifteen more seconds!

20
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,290
Yumioka's pulling out her arm!

21
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,870
Stop! Just be still! Let me go to Yugoslavia with Inokuma-san!

22
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,270
It's already over.

23
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,250
You could pull something off by switching to a Tate Shihoh from that position,

24
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,730
but Beanpole ain't capable of that.

25
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,670
That's right! Switch to a Tate Shihoh!

26
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,130
How do I perform a Tate Shihoh?

27
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,420
Grab her thighs with your legs!

28
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,050
Save your breath.




29
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,090
Hurry! Or else she'll break your hold!

30
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,730
Yumioka pulled her arm out! She's breaking the hold!

31
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
All right! A Tate Shihoh!

32
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,250
Wait, that's not a Tate Shihoh!

33
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,240
That's a...

34
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,930
Diagonal Shihoh?

35
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,200
There's no such move!

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,130
I can't believe she's pinning her that way!

37
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,750
How can she be so flexible?



38
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,350
Hold on to her for dear life!

39
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,960
Don't you dare let go!

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,770
Only ten seconds left, Fujiko-san!

41
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,790
Hang on!

42
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,260
Five seconds!

43
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,140
Three... two...

44
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,900
Ippon!

45
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,180
It's Ito Fujiko with an Osaekomi Ippon!

46
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,900
What a huge comeback! She's heading to the finals!

47
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,490
Inokuma-san.

48
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,120
Wow, you're so awesome, Fujiko-san!

49
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,810
I won...

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,410
Are you okay?


51
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,380
I'm so ashamed.

52
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,460
I became overconfident after winning a few matches, despite being weak.

53
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,470
No, you're not, Fujiko-san.

54
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,590
But I won't give up.

55
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,000
Just one more match.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,120
I get to go to Yugoslavia with you if I win once more!

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,140
We can do it.

58
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,220
Fujiko...

59
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,100
Hold on, Fujiko-san.


60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,740
So they're going to the World Championships together?

61
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,700
Then Saikai U's judo team?

62
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,750
What have you decided to do, Yawara-san?

63
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,170
<i>All Sports News?</i>

64
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:24,110
Yes, I heard that Oshiuri Travel Agency has made an offer to Inokuma Yawara.

65
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,170
Your sharp ears give you print reporters an advantage over us.

66
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,170
Oh, come on. You're the one with the expert judgment.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,090
Hiring Inokuma Yawara will do wonders for your publicity,

68
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,890
especially with Barcelona coming up.



69
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,760
You've got that right! That's why we set up our own judo dojo in the first place!

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,220
She's ours for the taking.

71
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,240
A new dojo? That's amazing!

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,190
As long as she keeps winning, we'll score an Ippon victory against our competitors.

73
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,540
That's pretty good, Mr. President!

74
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,380
In any case, Inokuma Yawara fits perfectly with our corporate image!




75
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,880
Very good, Mr. President. 
You certainly know young people!

76
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,040
I need that girl in order to beat the other apparel companies.

77
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,990
I see.


78
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,640
She looks good in a judo gi <i>and</i> in our clothes, so it's perfect, right?

79
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,120
Of course Inokuma Yawara will win the gold for us at Barcelona.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,030
You're quite confident at Mini House.



81
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,330
It's my dream to see one of my employees take a gold medal on the world stage.

82
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,160
That sounds like a magnificent project.

83
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,950
Just as magnificent as the publicity you'll get.

84
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,900
You can't even imagine.

85
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,550
Inokuma-san, I brought your lunch!

86
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,190
Inokuma...

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,060
Oh, there she is!

88
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,280
They're just going to use you.

89
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,040
No!

90
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,280
I want to work for them normally!


91
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,390
You may think that, but they think differently.

92
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,290
Those firms want the publicity boost that comes with your judo wins.



93
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,700
Right now, judo's gonna follow you wherever you go.

94
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,300
There's no escaping judo, not now, not ever.

95
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,740
You're no longer a normal girl.


96
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,600
I'm not against you working for a company and giving them free publicity.

97
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,950
You can also continue your judo at Saikai University.

98
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,080
However, it's judo whichever way you turn.



99
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,040
I wrote down "travel agent" as my top career choice.

100
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,720
I wanted to work using my own abilities.

101
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,000
If I was a travel agent, I'd be able to see the world.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,560
That's all there is to it.

103
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,300
Then...

104
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,500
We'll be holding the championship rounds for each weight class this afternoon.

105
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,550
Master! Master Inokuma Jigoro! Um...

106
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,570
Leave me alone!

107
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,320
Master!

108
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,650
Please, let us at Tsurukame Travel have Yawara-san, and...

109
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,110
Tsurukame, Tsuruhage, whatever you are, Yawara ain't gonna work!
Note: "Tsuruhage" means "completely bald."#

110
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,040
I-Isn't there any chance?

111
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,820
Um, yes?

112
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,040
Yawara's already decided her career path!

113
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,800
She's joining Saikai University's judo team.

114
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,060
I'm sorry.




115
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,150
I didn't know you wanted to work so badly.

116
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,940
I thought you wanted to go to Saikai University.

117
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,440
Don't sweat it, Fujiko-san.

118
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,580
I'm such an idiot!</i>

119
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,760
I had that discussion with her before her big match!</i>

120
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,540
Now her heart's not in the match!</i>

121
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,540
Sir, cheer up!

122
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,050
Forget it. Hiring Inokuma Yawara was too tall an order.

123
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,630
Sir...

124
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,340
Inokuma-san!




125
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,350
Oh, you're from Tsurukame Travel.

126
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,770
Thank you, Inokuma-san, for letting me dream.

127
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,000
But there's no chance you'd come work at a place like ours.

128
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,780
We at Cordial Tsurukame Travels wish to confess something to you.

129
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,160
When we said we had a judo team, that was a complete lie.

130
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,330
We don't have a judo team or a dojo.

131
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,100
We would get more customers if you just sat at our reception desk and smiled.

132
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,090
That's why I lied.

133
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,600
Accept my apologies!

134
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,380
W-Wait...



135
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,970
Now then, good luck with your judo.

136
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,190
We'll be cheering for you.

137
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,280
We're now starting the championship round for the 48kg-and-under class.

138
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,780
Yawara-san!

139
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,780
I'm sorry for deflating your hopes right before your final match!

140
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,950
But please, focus your attention on the match!

141
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,340
Yes, forget everything and win this one!

142
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:57,800
Did you hear that? Cordial Tsurukame wants me to sit at a reception desk.

143
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,300
Yawara-san, come on. You're up.

144
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,800
But...

145
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,240
He says he has no judo team!

146
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,360
Yawara-san, hurry!

147
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,690
Right!

148
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,610
Please, concentrate on the match!

149
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,620
Okay!

150
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,580
What?

151
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,940
Finally, the All Japan Selected championship rounds for all weight classes are about to start!

152
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,010
And they begin with a bang, namely, World Cup gold medalist, Inokuma Yawara.

153
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:49,600
She'll be facing last year's 48kg-and-under champion, Tsukushi U's Ogaki Noriko!

154
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,850
It's that midget from the Ajisai Cup!

155
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,850
Ogaki, get her!

156
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,860
Yes!







157
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,830
I've lived for this day ever since the Ajisai Cup.

158
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,870
I've studied Inokuma Yawara thoroughly... just to defeat her!

159
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,880
Just as planned!

160
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,990
He's taking it personally because

161
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,570
Inokuma-san!
He's taking it personally because

162
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,290
Yawara-chan whipped his butt.
Inokuma-san!

163
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,030
Yawara-chan whipped his butt.

164
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,830
You're just gonna lose again!

165
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,840
There's something about that smile.</i>

166
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,200
Bow!

167
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,780
Wh-What's with you, Matsuda-san?

168
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,100
It's just like that other time!

169
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,400
Back when she was going to throw her debut match with Todoh Yuki,

170
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
she looked just as cheerful!

171
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,110
Yawara-san...

172
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,100
Wh-What's the matter, Matsuda-san?

173
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,860
Don't you get it?! She's about to throw her match!

174
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,440
Hajime!

175
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,660
Don't do it, Yawara-san! I was wrong!

176
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,050
I shouldn't have said judo would follow you whether you worked or went to college!

177
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,660
Inokuma!

178
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,850
Inokuma-san!
Inokuma!

179
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,140
I'm sorry I said you're not a normal girl!

180
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,560
I take it all back!

181
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,520
Don't do something stupid like quit judo!

182
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,230
Yes, a foot technique! Don't let her flip you!

183
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,820
After that, we'll unleash our secret weapon!

184
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,830
If she tries a flip, spring back!

185
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,520
Good, good!

186
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,170
Get the timing down for releasing your secret weapon!

187
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,550
It's just like that other time!
 She's just pretending to fight hard!

188
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,630
Is she just pretending to fight?</i>

189
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,180
Now! Unleash your secret weapon!

190
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Ah, stop this!

191
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,640
Ippon!

192
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,110
Yawara-san...

193
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,220
Inokuma Yawara is the champion!

194
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,580
With this momentum, she's got the World Championships all but sewn up!

195
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,310
Wow, what an incredible Ippon Zeoi!

196
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,050
Yes, it was as smooth as the one during the World Cup.

197
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,090
No, it was even smoother.

198
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,060
I might make it.

199
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,050
Inokuma-san, that was an amazing Ippon Zeoi!

200
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,560
You're finally going to the World Cup!

201
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,890
Excuse me, let me though!

202
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,630
Inokuma-san, a word!

203
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,760
She won, right?

204
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,650
What's with her?

205
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,280
I don't get it!

206
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,500
You must be disappointed, Coach Ishikura.

207
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,240
What was this secret weapon you were talking about?

208
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,210
We put everything together, everything.

209
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,250
But she did that amazing Ippon Zeoi before we could try it!

210
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,610
They're gone.

211
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,610
Yawara-san!

212
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,750
Yawara-san, what's the matter? Did something happen?

213
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,320
Matsuda-san?

214
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,340
Yes?

215
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,320
Let's go!

216
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,160
Fujiko-san's about to have her final match!

217
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,590
She's made up her mind!

218
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,870
Jigoro-san?

219
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:50,840
That smoothness of her Ippon Zeoi, that cheerful demeanor. She's chosen her path.

220
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,880
That means...

221
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,850
She's officially making a beeline to Saikai U!

222
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,650
Sir, are you sure we should leave?

223
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,110
I wonder if Inokuma Yawara won?

224
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,380
You <i>wonder</i> ? You <i>wonder</i> if she won?!

225
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,120
No, I-I mean...

226
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,100
You can't tell a winner when you see one?

227
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,220
And you call yourself a human resources manager!

228
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,120
Sir!

229
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,790
Go on. Go ahead and shut your eyes.

230
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,880
Oh, there it is. You can see it!

231
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,300
See? See?


232
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,890
Can't you see it as clear as day?

233
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,050
What a huge waste.

234
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,640
And she came to interview with <i>us</i>.

235
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,480
What choice did we have?

236
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,350
Without a judo team, her talents would've been wasted if she worked for us.

237
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,280
That girl, Inokuma Yawara, will go to Saikai University

238
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,920
and conquer the world as a superstar.

239
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,690
But will she continue with college?

240
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,390
What if she's suddenly lured away by Oshiuri Travel Agency?

241
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,750
I won't lie to Yawara-chan!

242
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,990
But her gramps said she's going to Saikai U.

243
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,890
She didn't tell us that herself!

244
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,570
She's a good girl. She won't go against her grandfather's wishes!

245
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,640
You're really passionate about that girl, sir.

246
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,490
You've fallen for her. I can tell.

247
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,800
What the h— Ouch!

248
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,570
I only wish I had a granddaughter like her. That's all.

249
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,750
Sir, even your ears are beet red.

250
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,970
I don't have an indecent bone in my body!

251
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,130
I'm sorry!

252
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,210
Sir!

253
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,130
She's a good girl.

254
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,410
Sign: Players' Waiting Room#

255
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,100
Huh?
Sign: Players' Waiting Room#

256
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,110
Huh?

257
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,560
Inokuma-san's going to Saikai U?

258
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,250
She must've decided that going with you to Saikai U is better

259
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,570
than being used as an advertising gimmick.

260
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,580
Inokuma-san...

261
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,540
Fujiko-san, you're up!

262
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,760
We're now starting the championship round for the 61kg-and-under class.

263
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,990
Be strong, Fujiko-san. Don't rush it!

264
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,010
Keep your eyes peeled!

265
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,220
U-Understood!

266
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,300
J-Just one more.



267
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,810
Win one more and you'll go to the World Championships!

268
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,230
Th-That's right. Just one more, Fujiko!</i>

269
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,820
Just win one more, and it's Yugoslavia!</i>

270
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,110
Here's Ito Fujiko, who's fought all the way to this match!

271
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,240
The All-Japan Selected 61kg-and-under championship round is about to begin!

272
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,510
Who would've predicted her brilliant feats?

273
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:10,790
In just her second tournament, the white belt Ito Fujiko has made it to the final round.

274
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,710
However, she's facing Obayashi Takayo,

275
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,840
winner of the Fukuoka Internationals and the National College Tournament.

276
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,800
She just missed winning the World Cup in a close decision, but she's that tough a competitor!

277
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,780
Can even Ito Fujiko overcome that sort of talent?

278
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,760
Yes.

279
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,550
We're talking about Ito Fujiko here. There's no telling what will happen.

280
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,770
Isn't that right, Master?

281
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,920
That's right!

282
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,440
You again?

283
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,930
Mr. Announcer,

284
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,950
you wanna know how to win against any opponent, no matter how strong they are?

285
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,490
Oh, what's the secret?

286
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Take my judo lessons!

287
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,580
Bow!

288
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,290
Inokuma-san, I'm coming with you!</i>

289
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm coming with you no matter what it takes!</i>

290
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,130
Hajime!

291
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,890
No matter what! No matter what!</i>

292
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,430
Huh? Um...</i>

293
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,440
Uh...</i>

294
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,600
Huh?</i>

295
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,280
Mate!







296
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,820
Jougai! Ito smartly fends off a throw!

297
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,240
However, she has to do better than that when facing Obayashi!

298
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,940
So you do this?</i>

299
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,430
Or this?</i>

300
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,250
This way? That way?</i>

301
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,860
Fujiko-san, loosen up and relax!

302
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,250
Watch out for the foot sweeps!

303
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,760
Hajime!

304
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,110


305
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,350
Huh?</i>

306
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,680
Something's definitely off!</i>

307
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,700
Fujiko's not as intense as she usually is!

308
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,230
She's just taking it easy.
 Isn't that right, Yawara-san?

309
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,150
Yes. But something's strange.

310
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,700
Um... uh...</i>

311
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,200
What?</i>

312
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,580
Here's my chance!</i>

313
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Un... deux...

314
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:27,010
Oh, no! I completely forgot how to play judo! What now?</i>

315
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,920
Wh-What's the matter, Master?

316
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,970
Left!

317
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,190
Left?

318
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,530
Left! Left!

319
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,020
I think that's your right hand.

320
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,940
I said "Left," dang it! Ain't you listening?

321
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,820
Y-You don't mean...

322
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,830
Fujiko-san has never played a left-handed opponent before!

323
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,540
Look, she's mirroring her opponent and grappling from her left!

324
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,830
That's why she's completely lost!

325
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,440
Fujiko-san, grapple like you usually do!

326
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,090
Grab her collar with your right hand!

327
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,510
Huh?

328
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,090
Don't hesitate! Just grab her collar with your right!

329
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,590
Her collar... with my right?</i>

330
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,830
This is bad!

331
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,340
She's never faced a southpaw before.

332
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,270
It won't be easy to grab her with the usual techniques!

333
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,280
She's not letting me grab her!</i>

334
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,830
Kazamatsuri! Why didn't you coach her in that area?

335
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,200
We didn't have time!

336
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,240
Oh, no, look out!

337
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,870
Oh, no, look out!

338
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,540
Oh, no, look out!

339
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,920
Oh, no, look out!

00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,450
Grandpa, have you ever wanted to go to a hot spring?

342
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,190
What? Are you saying Yugoslavia has good hot springs?

343
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,050
That's not what I meant.

344
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,420
In any case, once Beanpole wins the championship match,

345
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,010
you'll have to keep your word and go to the World Championships with her!

346
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,660
Ah, Fujiko-san, grapple with your right hand like you usually do!

347
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
