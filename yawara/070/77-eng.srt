1
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,040
If you work for us, you'll be free to play judo whenever you want!

2
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,670
Well, our company's judo team has the perfect equipment and coaching!

3
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,400
U-Um, sirs, now's not really the—

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,880
You're right.

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,060
This decision is way too important for you to decide now!

6
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,430
No, my friend is about to...

7
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,920
Inokuma-san, what should I do?</i></i>

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,060
Please hurry!</i></i>

9
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:15,030
New Deadly Technique!      
         The Nutcracker!!

10
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,220
Why don't we do this?



11
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,450
We won't get anywhere this way,

12
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,270
so why don't each of us give you a five minute sales pitch?

13
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,110
Sounds good!

14
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,540
A sales pitch?
Sounds good!

15
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,570
I can't give each of you five minutes!

16
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,540
Come now, no need to be so reserved.

17
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,980
Your final match isn't until later this afternoon, right?

18
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,380
I'm not being reserved. I really need to go.

19
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,050
Now, now.

20
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,060
Aw, geez, a sales pitch?

21
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,180
This isn't a good time! My friend's in a match.

22
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,100
This won't take long.

23
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,060
Yawara-san!

24
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,100
What are you doing here?
 Fujiko-san's about to lose!

25
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,610
Hurry!


26
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,600
H-Hey, wait a minute!

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,390
We're having an important discussion!

28
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,080
Who the hell are you people?

29
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,240
She needs to be with us!

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Let's go, Yawara-san!

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,080
Right!

32
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,340
Fujiko-san, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</i></i>

33
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,770
I want her! I want her so bad!</i></i>

34
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,690
We got her.</i></i>

35
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,290
This isn't over.</i></i>

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,730
I guess she does hate us now.</i></i>

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,810
Who were those suits?

38
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,270
They were all company presidents!

39
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,820
Presidents? Yawara-san, don't tell me you're—

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,370
Waza Ari!

41
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,620
It's a Waza Ari! And right on top of a Yuko!

42
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,410
Mochida takes an overwhelming lead!

43
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,070
And only 30 seconds remain!

44
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,180
Although Ito Fujiko received the Saito-san Seal of Approval,

45
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,080
she's clearly out of her league here.

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,240
This isn't good.

47
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,840
Maybe her performance at the Ajisai Cup was a fluke?

48
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,350
Fujiko-san!

49
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,270
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san! Please don't give up!

50
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,200
Inokuma-san!

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,350
Jougai! Mate!

52
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,380
Remember what we did in practice, Fujiko-san!

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,860
Don't worry, you'll win!

54
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,280
Inokuma-san's voice is so soothing!</i></i>

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,360
B-But I can't pull it off.</i></i>

56
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,110
She's simply too good!</i></i>

57
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,870
Hajime!

58
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,560
What's the matter? This is weird!

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,470
Fujiko-san isn't maneuvering as she usually does!

60
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,670
Her opponent studied Fujiko-san's moves.

61
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,680
She's blocking the Ouchi Gari by leaning forward and leaving some space.

62
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,680
That prevents the deadly "Swan Lake" Ouchi Gari.

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,350
Oh no, is Fujiko-san going to lose?

64
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,190
She can't!




65
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,880
Then what about her "Nutcracker"?

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,480
"Nutcracker"?

67
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,930
Well, she hasn't perfected it yet.

68
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,130
It will be difficult to pull off at the last moment.

69
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,910
She can do it!

70
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,940
Fujiko-san can do it!

71
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,910
Because... Because... she's been practicing so hard!

72
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,920
Only twenty seconds left on the clock!

73
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,420
Do we call it a match?

74
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,590
Fujiko-san!

75
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,800
Un, deux, trois! The "Nutcracker"!

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,800
That's impossible!</i></i>

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,970
You can do it! You can do it, Fujiko-san!

78
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,390
You said we'd go to Yugoslavia together, didn't you?

79
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,770
Inokuma-san?</i></i>

80
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,060
There you go, Yawara.</i></i>

81
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,760
You've just said you're going to the World Championships in Yugoslavia,</i></i>

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,650
and a judoka never goes back on her word.</i></i>

83
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,910
Inokuma-san is going with me to Yugoslavia?</i></i>

84
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,660
Forget about the World Championships! Her transfer to Saikai U is in jeopardy!

85
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,490
Hey, did you just hear that, Yutenji?

86
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,570
Yawara just said she's going to the World Championships.

87
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,760
Master, now's not the time—

88
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,300
That girl said she's going to Yugoslavia with Fujiko!

89
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,020
Only ten seconds left!
 Ito Fujiko's at the end of her rope!

90
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,520
Fujiko!

91
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I knew judo was too much for her!

92
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,270
Matsuda-san? What do we do?



93
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,980
It's out of our hands!

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,030
Fujiko-san! Un, deux, trois! The "Nutcracker"!

95
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,540
Yugoslavia... The "Nutcracker"... Un, deux, trois...</i></i>

96
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,040
Only five seconds!

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,540
She's done for!

98
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,750
Four!

99
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,790
Fujiko-san!

100
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,790
I'll follow you anywhere, Inokuma-san!</i></i>

101
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,750
We'll go to Yugoslavia!</i></i>

102
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,510
We'll play judo at Saikai U!</i></i>

103
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,760
There's her Ouchi Gari!</i></i>

104
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,810
Un... deux... trois!

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,500
Was she in time?

106
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,650
Ippon! Done!

107
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,080
Wh-What a huge comeback!

108
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,620
Miraculously, Ito Fujiko won in the nick of time with an Uchi Mata!

109
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,340
Did you see that, honey? Fujiko did it!

110
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,920
I knew she could do it!

111
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,670
I'm so moved!

112
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,500
So that's the "Nutcracker"? Wow!

113
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,920
It's all thanks to her superior coaching!

114
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,430
Inokuma-san!

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,980
Fujiko-san!


116
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,370
You survived the first round!

117
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,770
You did it!

118
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,180
I'm sorry, Fujiko-san. I was late coming to cheer for you.

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,300
Don't be. I won because of you, Inokuma-san.

120
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,110
It's because you said we're going to Yugoslavia together.

121
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,810
So are we going to the Yugoslavia World Championships?

122
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,610
You're right! It looks like Yawara-san is going to the World Championships!

123
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,040
Master!

124
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,440
Huh? 



125
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,210
That was certainly a terrific Uchi Mata, Saito-san!

126
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,300
Wasn't it? It's just like I said, right? Right?

127
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,530
These eyes didn't fool me at all.

128
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,560
However, I didn't know she could pull off such an amazing Uchi Mata.

129
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,560
All she did during the Ajisai Cup was the Ouchi Gari, correct?

130
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,480
Yes.



131
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,840
We should all fear the one who raised Inokuma Yawara,

132
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,570
and who brought forth Ito Fujiko's talents—

133
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,160
That's me!

134
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,220
Master Inokuma!

135
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,550
I have borne full witness to the fruits of your magnificent teachings!

136
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,170
This ain't nothing. Let's go out for some yakiniku sometime, Saito.

137
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,020
Master Inokuma, do you have any comments about your excellent pupils?

138
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,050
They still have a ways to go.

139
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,890
Hey, camera, get a close-up!

140
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,720
Make it two!

141
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,730
I'll be getting <i>two</i> tickets to send Yawara and Beanpole to the World Championships!

142
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,240
I-Incredible! Master Inokuma Jigoro has just declared certain victory!

143
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,450
Sign: Players' Waiting Room##

144
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,420
They probably went home furious because I ran out on them.







145
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,430
Yawara-san, those suits you were talking to, were they...

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,440
They were the heads of the companies I interviewed with.

147
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,940
I knew it!



148
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,650
Are you really going to work, Yawara-san?

149
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,200
Fujiko-san wants to go with you to Saikai University!

150
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,700
I know! I'm in a bind here.

151
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,280
You're in a bind?!

152
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,660
I guess you would be.

153
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,350
That's enough reporting for today.

154
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,380
I'm not reporting!

155
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,420
As a third party, you have no business complaining about her future plans.

156
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,680
You're a third party too!

157
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,110
Only she can decide which path will lead her to happiness.

158
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,910
Come, Yawara-san. Let's go.

159
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,040
Inokuma Yawara's coming to Oshiuri Travel Agency! You can tell from her response!

160
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,690
Mini House has a one-step lead.

161
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,210
Nobody can compete with our judo team and equipment.

162
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,390
Leave everything to me!

163
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,090
Inokuma Yawara will definitely work for the Ginza Can-Can Store!

164
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,440
Sir, what should we do?

165
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,060
There's nothing we can do! We're the only ones without a judo team!


166
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,680
Do something! Create a judo team, and do it now!

167
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,200
Y-Yeah, but...






168
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,040
We can make one if you like, but...

169
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,070
We need to show Inokuma Yawara we have the best equipment and coaches.

170
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,030
Isn't there anything we can do?

171
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:30,080
We are now starting the second round of the 61kg-and-under class.

172
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,000
And here's the attention grabber, Ito Fujiko, entering her second round!

173
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,140
Bow!

174
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,970
Hajime!

175
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,650
Fujiko-san! Un, deux, trois!




176
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,760
Keep your eyes peeled!

177
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,600
Un... deux... trois!

178
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,480
Ippon! Done!

179
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,980
All right!

180
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,640
This time it's her Ouchi Gari!

181
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,740
Ito Fujiko seems to become more dominating with every match she plays!

182
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,810
Fujiko-san! You're in the clear!

183
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,170
With this match, your transfer to Saikai U is all sown up!

184
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,970
You did it, Fujiko-san!

185
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,920
Congratulations!



186
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,380
All that's left is Yugoslavia, Inokuma-san!

187
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,470
Just two more wins, and it's the World Championships!

188
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,840
A graduation trip to Yugoslavia!

189
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm so jealous!

190
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,290
I know!
I'm so jealous!

191
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,910
This ain't right.

192
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,690
What do you mean?

193
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:46,200
I thought this match would take three minutes, so I poured in the hot water when it began...

194
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,050
Are you saying the match was too short?

195
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,660
Now I don't know how many minutes have passed!

196
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,660
But what bothers me more is the way Beanpole won.

197
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,030
Beanpole needs to work harder for her wins.

198
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,720
Look. She's practically walking on air now.

199
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,350
U-Um, are you really going to eat here?

200
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,250
Director, commercial! Cut to a commercial!

201
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,160
See? She did it too quick, so the noodles are still hard!</i></i>



202
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,100
I have a bad feeling about the semis.</i></i>

203
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:45,130
Yugoslavia. World Championships.</i></i>

204
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:52,140
That's where we'll take our graduation trip,</i></i>

205
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,790
Ah, how wonderful!</i></i>

206
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,800
That's Ito Fujiko doing her dance!</i></i>

207
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,690
This isn't unexpected, because she's a former ballerina!</i></i>

208
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:11,120
And this former ballerina won the first two rounds with Ippons, advancing to the semis!</i></i>


209
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,890
She better not get too pleased with herself.

210
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,240
Matches are like ramen cups:
 you can't tell unless you open the lid.

211
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,310
So the noodles were too hard?

212
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,050
Yes, the lid was opened a bit too soon.

213
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,550
I'm very displeased!

214
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,600
You can always close the lid again and wait longer.

215
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,130
You can't redo matches!

216
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,140
Weren't you talking about ramen cups?

217
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,150
Fujiko-san, keep this up,
 and the trophy is all yours!

218
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,640
Oh, you think so?

219
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,150
But still, Fujiko-san, when you do your Ouchi Gari, you need to be a bit more...

220
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,650
Fujiko!

221
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm so happy!

222
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,020
When you became depressed after your ballet dream ended,

223
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,700
I didn't know what would happen.

224
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,580
I'm so glad you cheered up!



225
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,620
Mom.. Dad...

226
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,440
Fujiko-san, the semi-final is not going to be as—

227
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,380
Thank you, Inokuma-san!

228
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,690
I owe everything to you, Inokuma-san!

229
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,270
Thank you!

230
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,800
Oh, please.

231
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,150
All right, Fujiko-san. Let's go to the waiting room for your massage.

232
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,810
Thanks, Hanazono-san!

233
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,500
Damn you! Are you using a "massage" as an excuse to touch my Fujiko?

234
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,590
Dad!

235
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,220
You're wrong! It's for her big match ahead.

236
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,780
My daughter's body is more precious!

237
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,690
Dad, stop talking nonsense!

238
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,360
I won't let you lay a finger on her!

239
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,450
Fujiko, you need to choose better men.
 I mean, look at him!

240
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,750
Let me go!

241
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,150
Will she be all right?

242
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,760
Well, it looks like Fujiko-san is going to Saikai U.

243
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,720
So what will you do, Yawara-san?

244
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,210
Are you going to let her go to the World Championships and Saikai U alone?

245
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,230
Do you really intend to start working?

246
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,730
I...

247
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,740
Ippon!

248
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,830
Yumioka advances to the semis with her Harai Goshi!

249
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,750
That's where she'll face Ito Fujiko!

250
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,830
What an incredible Harai Goshi!

251
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,980
Yeah.

252
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,170
I'm going after Fujiko-san!

253
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,380
Wait!

254
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,380
Yawara-san! It's good to worry about Fujiko-san, but what about yourself?

255
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,920
Your final match is coming up!

256
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,050
Sir, please calm down.

257
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,540
Our first priority is to make a good impression on Inokuma Yawara!


258
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,580
If Oshiuri has their judo team, then we hit her with our cordial sincerity.

259
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,190
Our motto is "Cordial Tsurukame Travel," after all.

260
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,470
Sir, let's keep pressing forward!

261
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,980
Shut up! Enough of your babbling!

262
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,490
She's here!



263
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,500
You could have relaxed more!

264
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,910
Fujiko, does it hurt anywhere?

265
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,700
What are you saying? She's in tip-top shape!

266
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,250
Fujiko-san!

267
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,600
Get ready, sir.

268
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,250
Remember, cordial sincerity! Cordial!

269
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,760
Fujiko-san, listen!

270
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,250
If there's any discomfort...

271
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:17,880
Um...

272
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,680
Fujiko-san, listen!

273
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,770
She completely ignored us!

274
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,080
She must hate us, right?

275
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,780
Sir, you must be cordial!
 We're "Cordial Tsurukame"!

276
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,990
Now listen, Fujiko-san. Your next opponent has an incredible Harai Goshi.

277
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,020
Stay low and be careful not to give her any openings. And also—

278
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,750
There's no need to worry, Inokuma!

279
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,670
Fujiko-san can take on any opponent who comes along!

280
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,800
That's right, I can handle it, Inokuma-san!

281
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,670
I just have to watch out for her Harai Goshi!

282
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,220
Yes, but it's not just that.




283
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,720
We are now starting the semifinal round of the 61kg-and-under class!

284
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,150
Well, I'm off!

285
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,640
Good luck out there! 

286
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,710
You can do it! 

287
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,980
Kick her butt!
Fujiko-san...

288
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,540
You're doing great, Beanpole!

289
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,950
Wow, she looks like she owns the place!

290
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,580
Here comes Ito Fujiko!

291
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,820
She literally becomes more imposing with each match!

292
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,460
Her opponent is Yumioka Mayumi!

293
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,460
Will she be able to stop Ito's momentum?

294
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,810
Take her out, Fujiko-san!

295
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,670
Go after her with confidence!

296
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,470
You can do it!



297
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,180
Fujiko-san's all fired up!

298
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,240
That advice you gave her must have struck a nerve!

299
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,790
But it's not just the Harai Goshi.

300
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,690
What do you mean?

301
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,440
Beanpole isn't up against just the Harai Goshi, she's also up against herself!

302
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,120
Grandpa!

303
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,140
Wasn't that what you were about to say, Yawara?

304
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,030
Y-Yeah.

305
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,200
Fujiko-san's up against herself?

306
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,960
You got it!

307
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,710
Beanpole has certainly gotten better, thanks to me.

308
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,210
But winning in judo isn't just about taking the initiative and going on the offensive.

309
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,530
You saw that her second match boosted her confidence a lot.

310
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,220
But if she's overconfident and rushes in like a fool, she's in for a world of hurt.

311
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,640
A world of hurt?

312
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,290
What can you do?

313
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:35,040
Even if she loses here, I'll beat her back into shape at Saikai University, along with Yawara!

314
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,730
Grandpa!

315
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,230
Hajime!

316
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,790
Good luck, Fujiko-san!</i></i>

317
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,250
Her moves have gotten even cooler!

318
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,780
Keep it up! Keep it up!

319
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,800
Fujiko, looking good!

320
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,180
There's her "Nutcracker"!

321
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,190
Don't!

322
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,690
Waza Ari!

323
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,060
Jougai! Mate!

324
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,770
You're kidding!






325
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,740
She completely countered the "Nutcracker"!

326
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,250
Fujiko-san.

327
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh, no. Was I...</i></i>

328
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,490
Was I...</i></i>

329
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,890
full of myself, even though I'm weak?</i></i>

330
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,980
Inokuma-san, I'm so ashamed!</i></i>

331
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,950
I was beside myself with ecstasy over winning a few lousy matches.</i></i>

332
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,950
But I want to go to Yugoslavia, even if I'm weak!</i></i>

333
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,520
I want to go with Inokuma-san!</i></i>

334
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,470
Hajime!


335
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,000
That's right! Now wait for her next move!

336
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,930
Her clock has already run out.

337
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,520
No, it hasn't!

338
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,140
Take a gander.

339
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,930
Yuko!

340
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,680
Get away, she's trying to pin you!

341
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,000
If she gets pinned, it's all over.

342
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,200
I haven't taught Beanpole a single thing about pins.

343
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,220
Don't! Going that way will have the opposite effect!

344
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,660
Wrap your legs around her!

345
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,790
It's pointless!

346
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,580
She may be superior at the Ouchi Gari and the Uchi Mata,

347
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:56,590
but she's less than an amateur about pins.
She may be superior at the Ouchi Gari and the Uchi Mata,

but she's less than an amateur about pins.

349
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,800
