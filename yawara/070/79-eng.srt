1
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,240
Left!

2
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,160
Fujiko-san has never played a left-handed opponent before!

3
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,220
Look, she's mirroring her opponent and grappling from her left!

4
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,130
That's why she's completely lost!

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Fujiko-san, grapple like you usually do!

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,090
Grab her collar with your right hand!

7
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,070
This is bad!

8
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,650
She's never faced a southpaw before.

9
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,390
It won't be easy to grab her with the usual techniques!

10
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,090
Oh, no, look out!

11
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,650
Oh, no, look out!

12
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,310
Oh, no, look out!

13
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,770
Oh, no, look out!

14
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,820
You Can Do It, Fujiko!






 First Place Is Right in Front of You!!

15
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,370
Yuko!

16
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,300
Yuko! Obayashi gets a Yuko with her Hane Goshi! 

17
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,240
Mate!


18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,890
Whoa, Ito Fujiko just narrowly escaped an Ippon!

19
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,060
But that Yuko is big.

20
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,190
In any case, Ito has never faced an opponent who grapples from the left!

21
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,460
Isn't that right, Master?

22
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,910
Well, she'll pull through.



23
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,410
No, she can't! Not in this case!

24
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,410
If she wants to win, she'll find a way.

25
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,970
Fujiko-san, don't worry about her being left-handed!

26
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,710
Just grab her first using your own style!

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,120
E-Easier said than done!</i>

28
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,870
What should I do?</i>

29
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,130
I want to win!</i>

30
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,300
I want to win and go to Yugoslavia with Inokuma-san!</i>

31
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,520
Do something, Kazamatsuri!

32
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,330
Make the impossible happen, like when you hit on chicks!

33
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,990
Stop talking nonsense!

34
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,440
Just grapple with your right, Fujiko-san! Get into a Kenka Yotsu stance! 

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,950
A fight?
Note: "kenka" means fight.#

36
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,140
Are you telling Fujiko to get into a fight with her?

37
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,360
Don't do that!




38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,750
No, I'm not.

39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,100
Mate! Jougai!

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,310
What's the matter with you, Beanpole?

41
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,700
Keep that up, and it'll be over before you know it!

42
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,150
Where's your "Un, deux, trois"?

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,480
Yawara-chan, do something!

44
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,130
I've already reserved a place for the victory party!

45
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,580
Yeah, but for now...

46
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,330
Fujiko-san! Grab her back collar!

47
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,690
Her back collar? I can't!</i>

48
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,960
She won't let me grab her even with my right hand!</i>

49
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,970
Hajime!

50
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,220
Back collar...</i>

51
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,890
Let me grab your back collar!</i>

52
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,940
Obayashi with a Sasae Tsurikomi Goshi! 

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,940
Don't!





54
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,400
Mate!

55
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,900
It's a Jougai! Ito nimbly fends off her move!

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,210
Less than two minutes left now!

57
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,460
This is the All-Japan Selected 61kg-and-under championship match!

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,400
It's Obayashi on the attack, going after that trophy!

59
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,380
And here is Ito Fujiko, who's at the end of her rope!

60
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,930
Even though she's just down a Yuko,
 she's facing a barrier even taller than she is!

61
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,460
Hajime!



62
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,650
I knew it would never work out.

63
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,120
Hey, now wait! There's still time!

64
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,580
No, Fujiko is that type of girl.

65
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,080
She never wins first place.

66
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,170
Wh-What are you saying, Mother?

67
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:12,290
Back in kindergarten, she was absolutely the best at ballet!

68
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,220
Right, dear?

69
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,640
Yeah, she was.

70
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,600
We thought she would play Snow White in her school play,

71
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,000
but the part went to the cutest girl in the Peach Class,

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,960
while Fujiko played the old witch.

73
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,620
An old witch who danced really well.

74
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,840
It was like that in grade school too.

75
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,540
When she was finally picked for a starring role, she caught the mumps.

76
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,340
She wanted to go on stage no matter what...

77
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,390
but her doctor forbade it.

78
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,720
Right.

79
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,770
When she anchored a relay race, she tripped right before the finish line and came in last.

80
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,400
We're talking about ballet!

81
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,450
Fujiko-san.

82
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,680
You poor thing!







83
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, and once she fell off the stage while starring in "The Nutcracker."

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,910
There's more?

85
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,120
How tragic!


86
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,310
And all along, she grew taller and taller,

87
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,770
but she still practiced her heart out.

88
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,770
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>
but she still practiced her heart out.

89
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:33,760
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.</i>

90
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,470
However, it was all in vain.

91
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,950
She grew so tall that she had to give up ballet.

92
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,140
The spotlight never shone on her once.

93
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,290
It'll never happen. She won't win first place.

94
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,210
Not even in judo!

95
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,970
Honey.

96
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,120
Of course she will!

97
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,900
Of course she will.

98
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,120
That's because Fujiko-san...

99
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,720
keeps standing up and fighting.

100
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,840
She never backs down!

101
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,470
I-Inokuma...

102
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,540
So I know she'll win!

103
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,850
I <i>know</i> !

104
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,190
Let me go with her, please!</i>

105
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,230
Let me go with Inokuma-san to the World Championships!</i>

106
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,070
Let me grab your back collar!</i>

107
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,860
Your back collar!</i>

108
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,890
Let me take your back collar!</i>

109
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,920
Please!</i>

110
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,930
I've got it!</i>

111
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,890
I've got it! I've got her back collar!

112
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,850
Hurry, or else she'll break out of it!

113
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,600
R-Right!

114
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,110
Un. Deux. Trois...

115
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,360
Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois. Un, deux, trois.

116
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,900
Un, deux, trois!

117
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,950
Un, deux, trois!

118
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,450
Un, deux, trois!

119
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,450
There it is!

120
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,950
All right!

121
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,410
Ippoâ€”

122
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,130
Jougai! Mate!

123
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,630
No way!

124
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,190
At least give her a Waza Ari or a Yuko for that!

125
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,390
Damn! It was perfect too!

126
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,030
Fujiko-san?

127
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,550
I will follow you.</i>

128
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,660
I will follow you, Inokuma-san, no matter what!</i>

129
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,260
Less than thirty seconds on the clock!

130
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,710
Hajime!

131
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,620
Go!

132
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,880
Fujiko!

133
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
That's the way! Do it!

134
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,630
Time's running out!

135
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,150
Do something!

136
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,570
Grab her!

137
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,650
Don't let her go!

138
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,200
Fujiko-san, get her! Get her!

139
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,960
Fujiko-san!

140
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,910
Fujiko!

141
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,920
I knew she wouldn't get first place!

142
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,520
Obayashi takes down a desperate Ito Fujiko with a Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi!

143
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,730
Fujiko-san, fend it off!

144
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,360
Ito fends it off!

145
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,860
Even though she held it off,
 she'll lose once time runs out!

146
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,330
I'm coming with you, Inokuma-san!</i>

147
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,910
I'm coming with you, no matter what the cost!</i>

148
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,810
A... Morote Gari?

149
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,670
What's the referee's call?

150
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,270
Yuko!

151
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,640
You...

152
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,870
You did it!

153
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,490
It's a Yuko! Ito's last desperate Motote Gari got her a Yuko!

154
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,810
Oh, and now...

155
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,070
Done!

156
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,610
All right!

157
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,000
Huh? What happened?

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,070
Did she win?



159
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,120
A decision! The match comes down to a decision!

160
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,460
There's truly no telling when it comes to judo!

161
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,320
Obayashi took the first Yuko and dominated the match!

162
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,090
But with Ito taking back that Yuko at the last minute...

163
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,220
Yeah, but strictly speaking, I'm not so sure Obayashi dominated the match.

164
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,060
Huh?

165
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,730
Although it was ruled out of bounds, Ito unleashed that Uchi Mata in the second half.

166
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,910
Th-That must have left a big impression.

167
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,840
So our Fujiko might actually win first place?

168
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,280
It's not that she might.

169
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,290
She will.

170
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,530
Fujiko-san will be the national champion!



171
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,160
Let's hope the victory party won't become a pity party.

172
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,460
Fujiko-san...

173
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,870
Your call!

174
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,030
It's a split decision from the sub-refs!

175
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,580
So how will the head referee call it?!

176
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,670
All right! Yay!

177
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,820
Obayashi's the champion!


178
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,300
She won her long-sought All-Japan Championship!

179
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,660
Even though she lost, Ito really did well against Obayashi!

180
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,190
She was definitely tenacious!

181
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,750
I can't believe it came down to a referee's decision!

182
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,940
You're a magnificent coach, Master.

183
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,130
She still lost.

184
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,910
But she narrowly lost to <i>the</i> Obayashi!

185
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,980
"Narrowly," my eye. "Decision," my foot.

186
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,970
Beanpole failed miserably by not getting an Ippon.

187
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,600
Way to go, Beanpole!



188
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,470
I can't believe a white belt came this far!

189
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,160
Do your best next time!

193

Cheers!

194
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,720
The galbi's nicely cooked!

195
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,390
Oh! Hot, hot!

196
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,720
Th-There's nothing like yakiniku!

197
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,100
It's yakiniku or nothing!

198
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,520
Hey, if you don't eat up, they'll burn!

199
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,540
Okay!

200
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,050
Now let's party like there's no tomorrow!

201
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,510
What's the matter with you, Hanazono? Dig in!

202
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,290
Yakiniku tastes better when you fight for 'em!

203
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,970
Y-Yeah, you're right.

204
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,590
All right, I'll eatâ€”

205
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,810
Huh?

206
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,620
Isn't this good?

207
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,110
The food would be even more delicious if this wasn't a pity party!

208
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,490
Ow!

209
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,950
B-But...

210
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,340
Aren't you glad you've been accepted to Saikai University?

211
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,240
Y-Yeah, congrats!

212
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,460
I'm incredibly lucky! Just kidding.

213
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,170
That's certainly a silver lining!

214
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,310
Ow!

215
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,170
However, Fujiko-san definitely won that match.

216
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,120
Oh, what's wrong with you guys?

217
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,770
I'll just work harder playing judo at Saikai University.

218
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,370
And besides, Inokuma-san won the championship!

219
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,940
Fujiko...

220
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,610
It's too bad I won't be going to the World Championship in Yugoslavia,

221
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,630
but I'll make up for it by being your biggest fan!

222
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,390
Fujiko-san.



223
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,130
I was wrong to think of it as just some graduation trip!

224
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,960
You'll get your vacation. Don't you worry.

225
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,100
Once you improve, you'll be going to overseas tournaments, like it or not.

226
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,030
He's right. You'll get even better, Fujiko-san!

227
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,650
Really? I'll be able to go?

228
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,080
Yup!



229
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,400
Just go to Saikai U and work your tail off, along with Yawara.

230
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,410
Huh? Grandpa, I...

231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,960
Inokuma-san, please continue to look after Fujiko.

232
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,890
With Inokuma-san around,
 you'll become much stronger!

233
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,050
Even I got stronger thanks to Yawara-chan!

234
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:07,520
Yeah! I'm no Inokuma, but I'll also be there to lend you strength!

235
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
You don't need to follow her!

236
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,620
That's right! Who cares about a refereed loss!

237
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,570
Next time I'll win with an Ippon!

238
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,200
Got that right!

239
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,160
That's so cool, Fujiko-san!

240
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,740
Ito Fujiko's about to chug!

241
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,190
Fujiko-san! Let me do that with you!

242
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,580
You're not doing a damn thing with her!

243
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,800
Drink! Drink! Drink!
You're not doing a damn thing with her!

244

Fujiko-san...</i>

246
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,890
Fujiko-san definitely won that match!

247
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,970
Yeah!

248
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,770
Oh, why did you have to get so drunk?

249
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,770
Oh well, I'll take him home.

250
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,780
Fujiko-san!

251
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,250
Sorry about this, Kazamatsuri-san.

252
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,820
It's okay.

253
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,120
All right, Yawara-san. I'll be seeing you.

254
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,250
Okay.

255
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,460
You stupid...

256
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,510
Fujiko... swan!

257
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,930
H-Hanazono-san!

258
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,530
Hey, can I stay over at your apartment?

259
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,430
Aw, you're worried about me, aren't you?

260
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,950
Don't worry, I'm not feeling down!
 I'm perfectly fine!

261
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,960
See you!

262
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,520

Fujiko-san worked so hard! I feel bad for her!

269
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,960
Why feel bad? It's all on Beanpole's head for not getting an Ippon!

270
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,560
