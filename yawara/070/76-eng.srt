There it is! Her deadly "Nutcracker"!

00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,830
Yay!

3
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,250
Wow, that was awesome! 

4
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,160
Fools!

5
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,440
That was just dumb luck!

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,790
Now get back to practicing!

7
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,740
Still, Beanpole's improved quite a lot thanks to my superior instruction.</i>

8
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,560
I can't wait to see her in action.</i>

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,720
In tomorrow's All-Japan tournament.</i>

10
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,730
I'm So Mad!!

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,220
This is the qualifying tournament

13
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,820
for the World Championships to be held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia this October,

14
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,700
the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships.



15
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,450
It's about to start with headline-grabber Inokuma Yawara for the 48kg-and-under class.

16
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,210
Sparks will fly for the chance to represent Japan on the world stage!

18
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,830
What should I do?

19
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,690
Fujiko-san, write "person" on your palm.

20
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,730
But I've already done that a hundred times!



21
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,650
Say, "I'm the strongest one here," okay?

22
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,690
But I've already done that <i>two</i> hundred times!

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,660
What should I do, Inokuma-san?

24
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,860
Cheer up, Yawara-san.

25
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,650
You'll get an offer, maybe even tomorrow.

26
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,460
Things will turn out fine.

27
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm going to loosen up a bit.

28
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,460
O-Of course.

29
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,470
Inokuma-san?

30
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,850
My classmates are getting all kinds of offers, yet I...</i>

31
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,230
I guess it's because I don't have any real talent.</i>

32
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,870
Master, this is it!

33
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,930
Oh, Yutenji! The plan went without a hitch!

34
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,620
How about Yawara-san's job search? Did you convince her otherwise?

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,480
Who needs convincing?


36
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,540
I've shut off the flood of letters and phone calls that were coming her way.

37
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,220
A-Are you sure it's wise to go that far?

38
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,480
Something-Or-Other Travel was prattling on about an interview with their president today, but...

39
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,680
An interview with the president?

40
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
What was that you said, Grandpa?

41
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,650
Who cares what it is? I refused because of the tournament today.

42
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,100
You refused?!

43
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,480
So it <i>was</i> you, Grandpa!

44
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,110
I thought it was strange that nobody was calling me back!



45
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,120
You who ruined everything for me!

46
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,260
"Ruined"? Whaddaya mean, "ruined"?

47
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,080
I did that for you!

48
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,630
Grandpa, you idiot!

49
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,220
Yawara-san!

50
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,600
Sir, if you don't hurry,
 Inokuma Yawara's match will begin!

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,220
R-Right!

52
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,740
This is the best place for an interview, right, sir?

53
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,380
Still, are we doing the right thing?

54
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,170
If we intrude on her here, won't she despise us?

55
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,740
Was she just pulling our leg when she interviewed with us?

56
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,760
This is no time to be timid, sir. Come on!

57
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,740
Oh, right.


58
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,040
We will now begin the first round for the 48kg-and-under class.

59
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,470
I'm so mad! God!</i>

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,930
An interview with the president?</i>

61
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,930
I refused because of the tournament today. I did that for you.</i>

62
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,940
He didn't do that for me!</i>

63
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,900
All he did was ruin my chances for employment so I'd play judo at Saikai University!</i>

64
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,910
God, I'm so mad!</i>



65
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,950
I'm really, really mad!</i>

66
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,480
All right, let's put this away, Yawara-san!

67
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,720
It might be the National Judo Championships, but it's divided by weight class.

68
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,220
That's nothing to a free-weight champ like you.

69
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,920
This will make for a great story! Tomorrow you'll be on the front...

70
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,420
Huh?

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,180
Let me be clear. I'm not in judo for your articles.

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,470
Th-That scared me.

73
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,200
Kazamatsuri, what did you do to Yawara-san?





74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,440
I didn't do anything yet.

75
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,640
You must've done something! She's mad as hell!

76
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,400
Only because you were being rude to her again.

77
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,160
It's finally starting, sir.

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
Yes. Does she have a tough opponent?

79
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,290
Well, she's facing Fujimura Kumi, a 3-dan.

80
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,030
What rank is Inokuma Yawara?

81
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,140
Inokuma's a 1-dan.

82
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,610
W-Wait, can a 1-dan defeat a 3-dan? Are there handicaps?

83
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,800
I-I don't know. It's not the same as golf.

84
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,100
"I don't know" won't cut it! She needs to win!

85
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,770
She needs to win so we can employ her!

86
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,510
The red-hot battle that will determine the national champion,

87
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,580
and also determine who will go on to the World Championships, is about to begin!

88
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,590
This is the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships.

89
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,820
And here is our trusted color commentator...

90
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,780
This is Saito. I'm glad to be here.

91
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,750
Saito-san, Honami Sayaka isn't competing in this tournament,

92
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,830
leaving Inokuma Yawara alone in the spotlight.

93
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,830
That's true.




94
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,840
And Yawara is in top form after taking out five successive opponents at the Ajisai Cup.

95
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,070
And also, there's one more.

96
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,510
One more?

97
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,760
The girl entered in the 61kg-and-under class...

98
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,260
Ito Fujiko!


99
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,270
She's likely to become a real juggernaut in this tournament.

100
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,520
Inokuma-san, hang in there! Good luc—

101
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,750
Fujiko!
Inokuma-san, hang in there! Good luc—

102
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,280
It's all right to cheer for others, but what about yourself?

103
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,950
Mom, Dad, you two came again?

104
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,460
Of course we did! Your future is riding on this tournament!

105
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,780
Right, Master Yutenji?

106
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,020
That's right! Fujiko-san will be the dominating talent of women's judo.

107
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,260
I want you to do your very best in today's tournament!

108
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,260
Please don't put pressure on me!

109
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,310
Also remember, Beanpole, that Yawara's future depends on your performance.

110
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,270
My performance will determine her future?

111
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,490
Anyway, just do the judo that I taught you.

112
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,720
Everything will go according to my expectations.

113
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
S-Still, Master Jigoro, Yawara-san is really furious!

114
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,200
That's just the way she is. 
Where does she get it from anyway?

115
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,530
Such a selfish brat.</i>

116
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,040
It's now the first match. And here's the star, Inokuma Yawara!

117
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,190
Bow to each other!





118
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,300
Grandpa always does things his way. I swear to God...</i>

119
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,310
Inokuma looks unusually fired up for this match!

120
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,000
It's starting! Shouldn't we be cheering for her?

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,650
R-Right.

122
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,920
Why didn't we bring a banner saying,

123
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,070
"Good Luck, Inokuma Yawara, from Tsurukame Travel"?

124
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh, right.

125
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,280
Uh, sir!

126
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,330
Ippon! Done!

127
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,170
There it is! An instantaneous Ippon Zeoi!

128
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,050
Sh-She won, sir!

129
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,290
That's our Yawara-chan!

130
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,330
You're kicking butt!


131
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,730
You're truly amazing!

132
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,480
Just seeing your Ippon Zeoi calms my nerves a little!

133
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,750
Please be there for me during my match!

134
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,710
I will!

135
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,740
Yawara!

136
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,790
What were you pulling in that match?

137
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,700
You looked like some cat in heat doing that Ippon Zeoi!

138
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,450
She really is mad.

139
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,470
Stupid featherbrained dingbat.

140
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,820
Inokuma-san is fighting hard.

141
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,560
I must win so I can continue to play judo with her!

142
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,160
That's the spirit, Fujiko-san!

143
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,440
But aren't your knees shaking?

144
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,940
They are!

145
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,950

You think I'm going to miss this?

I'm going to make sure I witness our company's bright future...

S-Sir, what's going on?

152

I-Isn't he the president of Oshiuri Travel Agency, Usami Toshio?

153
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,550
They're the #2 travel agency,

154
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,670
because their cheap tours are really popular with young people.

155
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,710
Wh-Why is he...

156
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,670
Don't tell me he's...</i>

157
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,240
I-Is he also going after Inokuma Yawara?

Oh, the apparel maker?

161
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,230
Yeah, Inokuma Yawara interviewed with our company.

162
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,740
Since she is <i>the</i> Inokuma Yawara, we want to hire her immediately.

163
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,000
However, we were unable to get in touch with her,








164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,200
so we decided to come here today.

165
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,700
By the way, the president of Mini House is also right over there.

166

He's here for the same reason.
 I swear, everyone wants a piece of her.

Oh, sir!

Too strong!

169
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,760
She wins again with her overwhelming strength!

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,490
If that's the case, I'll have to begin from square one,</i>

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,910
Really? All right!

175
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,820
Are we clear, Fujiko-san?

176
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,920
It's almost your turn, so don't lose to Inokuma!

177
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,680
R-Right!

178
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,920
If you win this tournament,
 then you'll transfer to Saikai U!

179
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,920
If you go to Saikai U, then Inokuma will definitely follow you!

180
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,630
Yes!

181
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,760
She's won! Her third Ippon in a row!

182
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,400
She's completely peerless as she goes into the final round!

183
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,730
Yes, all according to plan!

184
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,410
That's the way, Yawara-san!

185
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,220
Nice, Yawara-chan!

186
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,890
Whaddaya mean, "nice"?

187
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,790
Whoever loses to that lazy Ippon Zeoi is nothing but a dummy.

Sign: Players' Waiting Room#

189
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,880
Yes, I should just start over,</i>

190
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,760
though I might have to wait a little.</i>


191
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,760
Attention! All players in the 61kg-and-under class, please assemble in the arena.

192
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,760
I almost forgot!

193
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,430
I have to go cheer for Fujiko-san!

194
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,220
Inokuma-san!

195
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,740
Inokuma Yawara-san.

196
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,980
My name is Usami of Oshiuri Travel Agency.

197
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,580
I'm Ozaki of the children's apparel company Mini House.

198
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,940
I'm Kodama of the Ginza Can-Can Store.

199
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,750
I-I...

200
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,900
Pleased to meet.

201
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,870
We will now begin the first round for the 61kg-and-under class.



202
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,720
We have Mochida Noriko in red and Ito Fujiko in white.

203
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,560
You can do it, Fujiko-san!

204
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,220
Fight for it, Fujiko!

205
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,690
Inokuma-san, hurry!</i>

206
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,070
Now it's the first round for the 61kg-and-under in the All-Japan Selected.

207
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:53,660
And here's the one Saito-san predicted might be today's juggernaut, Ito Fujiko!

208
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,700
Inokuma-san, where are you?!</i>

209
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,780
Um, how may I help you?




210
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:06,830
You see, we at Oshiuri Travel Agency are giving you a provisional— I mean, a permanent offer.

211
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:13,350
Wait. We at Mini House have formed our own judo team this fiscal year.

212
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,200
So we really need your talents at our company.




213
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,680
Well, we at Ginza Can-Can have brought the contract here with us!


214
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,680
We came here with the intention of treating you as a V.I.P.

215
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,110
We at Tsurukame...

216
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,650
Inokuma-san!
We at Tsurukame...

217
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,120
Please...

218
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,280
...sign our contract!

219
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,140
Excuse me...

220
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,370
Yawara-san!

221
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,620
Um, you're all speaking at once,
 so I'm not sure what you're saying.

222
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,170
That's right. You applied to four companies, Inokuma Yawara-san.

223
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,600
But you need to choose one right here and now.

224
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,170
So I implore you to come to Oshiuri Travel Agency!

225
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,920
No, Mini House!

226
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,490
No, Ginza Can-Can!

227
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,140
Um, uh...

228
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,930
Wait a minute! Right now I...

229
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,880
have to go and cheer for Fujiko-san.</i>

230
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,830
Please be there for me during my match!

231
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,870
Yes, there's no use standing here talking. Why don't we do this over some tea?

232
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,510
Don't just jump ahead of us, Oshiuri-san!

233
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,970
He's right! We have to be fair about this!

234
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,910
Excuse me...

235
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,910
Inokuma-san, hurry!</i>

236
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,790
Fujiko, be strong!

237
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,830
Your mother is here for you!


238
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,870
Fujiko-san, throw her to the ground!

239
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,670
You can do it!

240
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,150
If everyone gets to fight in such a huge arena,
 I should have entered myself!

241
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,800
There's no chance they'd even accept you!

242
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,940
Forward!

243
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,890
Y-Yes!

244
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,850
Hanazono-san!

245
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,900
Get in there, Fujiko-san! You can win!

246
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,650
What are you doing, Yawara-san?
 Fujiko-san's match is about to start!</i>

247
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,070
Master Inokuma, is she all right? She's stiff as a board!


248
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,630
She looks just like a wind-up toy.
 We shoulda made her drink some vinegar.

249
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,550
The first round for the 61kg-and-under in the All-Japan Selected has begun!

250
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,140
Bow to each other!

251
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,730
Look at that! She's a white belt!

252
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,140
Did she put on the wrong belt?

253
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,150
A white belt in the All-Japan Selected. Are you kidding me?

254
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,900
There is no mistake about it. 
Ito Fujiko is indeed a white belt.

255
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,910
Will she be all right? What do you think, Saito-san?



256
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,520
The color of their belts won't matter this time.

257
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,890
Inokuma-san!</i>

258
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,220
The opponent, Mochida Noriko, is a favorite to win this tournament and looks ready to fight!

259
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,840
What will I do? She looks so tough! I'm scared!</i>

260
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,140
Please hurry, Inokuma-san!</i>

261
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Hajime!

262
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,150
Incredible!</i>

263
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,200
What should I do, Inokuma-san?</i>

264
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,300
If you work for us, you'll be free to play judo whenever you want!

265
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,190
We have it all set up so that...

266
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,520
Well, our company's judo team has the perfect equipment and coaching!

267
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,750
Um, sirs, now's not really the...

268
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,250
You're right.




269
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,770
This decision is way too important for you to decide now!

270
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,460
No, my friend is about to...

271
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,590
Just think about it and come work for us!

272
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,140
Our firm will increase the judo team budget

273
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,150
in order to get you to the Barcelona Olympics, Yawara-san!

274
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,670
So relax and go get that gold medal!

275
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,420
U-Um...
So relax and go get that gold medal!

276
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,320
So relax and go get that gold medal!

277
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,500
A judo team?

278
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,950
This judo team... Usami-san, does Oshiuri Travel Agency actually have one?

279
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,370
Of course we do!

280
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,660
How could we even solicit <i>the</i> Inokuma
 Yawara-san without having a judo team?

281
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,740
Wait, are you saying <i>your</i> company doesn't have a judo team, Otaguro-san?

282
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,710
W-We do!



283
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,930
We have only the finest dojo and coaches.

284
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,630
Oh, that's the first I've heard of it!

285
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,670
Excuse me, I...

286
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,970
Mate!

287
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,600
Shido!


288
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,180
Oh my, Ito Fujiko gets a Shido!

289
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,190
Mochida won't get her match if her opponent keeps running away like that.

290
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,190
What's wrong, Fujiko-san? Go for it!

291
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,190
Show 'em how cool you are!

292
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,960
Go on the attack, Fujiko-san!

293
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
Just do what I taught you, and you'll be fine!

294
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,540
Fujiko-san is so nervous she can't get a handle on her judo style.</i>

295
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,620
So where's Yawara-san when Fujiko-san needs her the most?</i>

296
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,760
Fujiko-san, fight her!

297
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,030
Take her on!
Fujiko-san, fight her!

298
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,170
Get her!
Take her on!

299
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,630
I-I hear what you're saying, but...

300
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,170
Hajime!

301
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,180
Inokuma-san, what should I do?</i>

302
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,270
I'm at a complete loss here!</i>

303
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,780
Watch out, Fujiko-san!

304
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,740
Get around it!

305
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,540
Yuko!

306
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,880
Fujiko!

307
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,380
That's a Yuko! Mochida gets a Yuko with her Osoto Gari!

308
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,600
There may be two minutes left,

309
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,260
but Ito Fujiko's already behind, so that Yuko is huge!

310
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,930
Will that point decide the game?

311
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,070
Oh no, she's going to lose!

312
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,150
Get away!

313
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,390
What are you doing, Fujiko-san!

314
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,150
This is bad.

315
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,320
We should be asking what Yawara-san is doing!</i>

316
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,910
Where did she go anyway?</i>

317
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,890
Please come to our firm.

318
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,390
No, our company.

Geez...

323
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,630

324
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,180
Where's Yawara-san?!

325
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,730
Jougai! Mate!

this is what Beanpole has been going through!

There's no time left. You can do it!

335
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,080
From what I see, she's finished.

336
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,570
But she practiced so hard!




337
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,990
I know Fujiko-san can do it! And right now!
