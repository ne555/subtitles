1
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,970
They've really done it.

2
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,370
The MWJC team has really fought for it.

3
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,000
They are now giving the shiny, golden Ajisai Cup

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,890
to Inokuma Yawara, who led her MWJC team to victory!




5
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,620
Oh wait, to Minamida Yoko...

6
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,470
No wait, to Oda Mari!

7
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,510
Hey, I said I'd take it!

8
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,430
No way! I'd look better holding it!

9
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,640
It's now been awarded!

10
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,430
Their first championship on their first outing!

11
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,610
MWJC performed magnificently,
 despite being a team of white belts!

12
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:26,370
Inokuma Kojiro on the Move<i>!</i>

13
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,940
Now we turn to our commentator, Saito-san.

14
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,130
Let's replay their championship match with Tsukushi U,

15
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,420
particularly the final bout between Inokuma and Yamada.



16
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,410
In the beginning, they were just eying each other.

17
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,150
Here, Inokuma went for Yamada's right sleeve...

18
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,940
but Yamada fended her off!

19
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,900
Was Yamada planning something at that moment, Saito-san?

20
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,200
Yes, an Ude Garami.

21
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,000
An Ude Garami?

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
You got it!

23
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,900
An Ude Garami.

24
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,910
It's a frightening move, whether it's a standing throw or a pin.

25
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,740
Yamada was going to grab Yawara's elbow joint, risking everything.

26
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,000
But right at that moment...




27
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,970
Yawara quickly switched from a right-handed Ippon Zeoi to a left!

28
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,260
So from the outset, Yawara-san guessed that Yamada would come with an Ude Garami?

29
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,770
Guessed? Not a chance!

30
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,430
She was just using her reflexes!



31
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,430
Just her...

32
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,970
...reflexes?

33
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,370
That's right!

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,370
So, will you be able to keep up with my training?

35
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,040
That means you're willing to be my coach, doesn't it?

36
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,550
Just to warn you, my training will be beyond rigorous.

37
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,260
Rigorous training? Just the way I want it.

38
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,720
As long as I can beat that Inokuma Yawara.

39
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,460
Ever since I was young,

40
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,250
whether it was in horseback riding, swimming, skiing, tennis,

41
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,730
or even intelligence and beauty,

42
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,730
nobody ever surpassed me.



43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,740
Only that Inokuma Yawara obstructs me and refuses to yield.


44
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,740
What can you do? She's a prodigy.

45
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,770
She's a prodigy?

46
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm the one who's been blessed with those qualities!

47
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,960
All you are is ordinary. Just like me.

48
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,960
Attention all TV stations!

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,190
We're just about to have a few words
 with the ecstatic victors from MWJC!

50
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,940
The championship match was truly intense.

51
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,550
What are your thoughts on defeating five opponents in a row, Inokuma-san?

52
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,340
Yay!

53
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,690
Hi!


54
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:14,120
I knew we'd win from the start. 
That's because <i>I</i> drew up the strategy!

55
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,960
Say, which way is the camera?

56
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,320
Oh, there it is!

57
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,090
I was a little nervous, but I pulled my weight for everyone!

58
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,170
What? Since when?

59
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,400
Now look—

60
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,610
Everyone calls me "Marilyn"!

61
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,200
Also, my measurements are—

62
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,380
Nobody asked you!

63
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,240
Now see here!

64
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,190
Some people might want to know!

65
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,440
Inokuma-san.

66
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,450
Yamada Kaori-san.

67
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,110
That was an incredible match.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,860
Thank you.

69
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,110
No, I want to thank you.

70
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,610
We were thoroughly defeated.


71
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,870
I've played judo for many years, but I've never lost like that.

72
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,660
That's right.

73
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,910
Coach!

74
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,100
But it won't be the same next year.

75
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,400
We'll definitely beat you guys and get back our crown!

76
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,490
I'm sorry.



77
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,840
We're in our second year of junior college, so there is no next year.

78
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,400
Oh God... We'll remain losers?

79
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,060
Coach!

80
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,110
Now then, Yutenji,

81
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,960
time to put our plan in action.

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,860
We'll transfer both Yawara-san and Ito Fujiko-san to Saikai University!

83
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,990
Barcelona's definitely in our grasp!

84
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,870
That's right!

85
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,900
Milady!

86
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,360
Tokunaga, go home!

87
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,620
But, Milady!


88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,620
Our opponents are two prodigies named Inokuma Jigoro and Inokuma Yawara.

89
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,280
For ordinary players to catch up to prodigies, they need to do a million times,

90
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,080
no, five million times more training.



91
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,090
Let's put aside whether or not they're prodigies.

92
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,640
I've already told you that I'm ready for your rigorous training!

93
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,290
However...

94
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,640
even if ordinary players train five million times as much, they still can't defeat prodigies.

95
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,210
For mediocre players to win against prodigies, they need one more thing!

96
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,650
A-And that is?

97
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,110
Luck.

98
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,460
Luck?

99
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,120
Milady...

100
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,590
Milady!

101
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,850
A melody for your lips...

102
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,540
Honey, you've had too much!

103
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,390
Oh my God, I'm famous!



104
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,550
I bet those guys regret rejecting me now!


105
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,350
Oh, sounds like a party!

106
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,800
Congratulations on winning!

107
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,830
Matsuda-san!

108
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,980
Can I interview everyone?

109
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,990
Please, we're already sick of interviews!

110
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,940
Come on, party with us!

111
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,480
All right, count me in.

112
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,440
Drink up! Drink up!

113
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,760
Hey, Matsuda-san, still on the beat?

114
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,200
We're really enjoying our get-together!

115
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,920
Quit laughing!

116
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,800
Kazamatsuri, what are you, the Seishin Women's coach, doing here?

117
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,170
Are you sure you don't want to be with Honami Sayaka?


118
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,730
Come now.

119
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,940
We're no longer opponents when the matches are over. Right, Yawara-san?

120
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,230
Yeah.

121
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,770
Also, I don't need to go back to her anymore.

122
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,780
Wh-What did you say?


123
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,700
Come with me!

124
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,910
What's with you?

125
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,670
Matsuda-san?

126
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,280
C'mere!

127
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,830
Honami Sayaka's gone missing?

128
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,880
That's right. And thank God for that.

129
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,840
She made me hole up at her place for the longest time.

130
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,880
Now I'm finally free to do what I want.

131
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,560
So she's missing.


132
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,890
Is she perhaps undergoing special training?

133
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,050
I'd say so.

134
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,890
She left with Kojiro-san.

135
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,400
What? Kojiro-san?!

136
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,860
Shush. Yawara-san will hear you.

137
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,450
So Kojiro-san has finally become Honami Sayaka's coach?


138
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,490
Drink! Drink! Drink!

139
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,030
Drink! Drink! Drink!

140
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,600
Hey, Matsuda-san!

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,460
Be sure to show my exploits in a color spread!

142
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,960
Yeah, we'll think about it.


143
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,710
You should ask him to put your photo in a sex column!

144
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,930
I can't do that. This is an important step for my future acting career!

145
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,430
Speaking of the future...



146
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,980
We need to start looking for jobs soon.

147
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,440
Yeah.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,940
Y-You're right.

149
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,010
What should I do?

150
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,440
I'll be an actress. An actress!

151
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,400
Th-That's right. There is that problem.

152
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,450
Yawara-san and Fujiko-san will be heading for Saikai University.

153
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Yes, I'll track down Honami Sayaka's whereabouts.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,430
Relax, Chief! I'll get you a huge scoop!

155
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,660
Scoop, huh?

156
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,860
But I can't possibly write an article on Kojiro-san.

157
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,900
Congratulations.

158
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,870
Thank you very much. It was fun.

159
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,780
It was fun?


160
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,370
I can't believe I'm hearing you say judo was fun!


161
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,920
That's because I have great friends.

162
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,800
But I can't continue enjoying myself.

163
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,550
I need to start looking for work.

164
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,810
W-Work? Where?

165
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,700
S-So what will happen with the transfer to Saikai University?

166
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,320
Will Jigoro-san once again force you into that?

167
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,280
Not only that, Kojiro-san has finally become Honami Sayaka's coach.

168
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,950
Wh-What are we doing in this hovel?


169
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,350
Any electricity?

170
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,620
No.

171
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,660
Plumbing?

172
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,290
No.

173
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,780
What about a bath?

174
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,250
Is there a sink I can use for my morning shampoo?

175
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,250
There's a river nearby.

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,460
This is where you plan to train?

177
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,580
Milady...

Look at this! A front-page color spread!

193
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,020
Yes, you can see my picture!

194
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,960
No way! Why are all of you in the sports papers?

195
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,200
Haven't you been watching TV?

196
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,070
We won the championship!


197
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,330
The TV cameras caught me so well.

198
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,490
I swear, I was totally born to be an actress!

199
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,910
That's awesome, Marilyn!
 Did you put on a good show?

200
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,080
It wasn't just "good"!

201
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,320
The entire audience was fixated on my beauty!

202
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,960
Stop your absurd lying!

203
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,010
Oh God, do I really look this chubby?

204
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,070
I knew Inokuma-san would appear in a feature article,

205
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,180
because she's a world-class competitor,

206
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,020
but I can't believe that you're in this huge feature, Fujiko-san!

207
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,230
She was totally awesome!

208
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,100
Fujiko-san defeated all sorts of formidable opponents!

209
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,910
Oh my gosh, Inokuma-san, you're embarrassing me!

210
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,570
But it's still all thanks to you, Inokuma-san.

211
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,990
Come on!



212
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,850
We won because all of you did your best.

213
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,050
Even Kyonkyon did very...

214
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,910
Huh?

215
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,540
Speaking of her...

216
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,000
These are heavy.

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,930
What are those?

218
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,970
I picked up some company brochures at the Employment Office.

219
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,460
That's right!

220
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,060
We can't stay here celebrating all day! We need to find jobs!

221
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,940
If we don't get started soon,
 all the good places will be taken! 

222
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,990
I feel for you guys.

223
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,490
Do you have an inside track somewhere, Marilyn?

224
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,760
I said I'm going to be an actress.

225
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,270
I'll take my brilliant achievement as the national champ in one hand,

226
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,900
and my beauty in the other, and make a smashing debut!

227
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,210
There are so many!

228
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,960
I think I'll take some too.

229
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,460
I get a lot of these in the mail!

230
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,470
I wonder how they get our addresses.

231
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,970
Mailed? To your home?

232
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,400
Yeah. Every day I get literally stacks of them.

233
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,480
What? You don't get any at home?

234
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,880
No, not one.


235
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,740
My word, these dang things arrive every day!


236

"Employment," my left ear.

237
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,720
Yawara ain't getting a job any time soon.

238
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,670
She's transferring to Saikai U and joining their judo team.

239
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,670
Is my sweet potato roasted yet?


240
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,720
Boy, does it look good!

241
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,220
She'll train like crazy so she'll get that gold medal in Barcelona!

242
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,060
Not to mention the National Achievement Award!

243
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,100
So good!


244
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,820
Yeah, this is Inokuma.

245
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,370
Is this Inokuma-san's residence?

246
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,430
I'm Omura, Human Resources for Miki Corp.

247
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,790
Yeah? You ain't hiring Yawara.

248
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,640
Actually, our company has formed a judo team this year.

249
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,720
So please, please, let Yawara-san join our company!

250
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,590
A judo team? Very good, very good!



251
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,760
You can make your players read my book "The 'Gentle Way' is not Built in a Day"!

252
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,560
It seems like everyone wants to get their hands on her.

253
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,900
The Saikai U transfer plan comes first!

254
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,440

...j-judo team?



258
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,920
Yes. I greatly admire the qualities that your daughter possesses.

259
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,350
So, I humbly ask that you leave Fujiko-san in my care.

260
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,570
Oh, hold on a moment, Master.



261
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,900
It's just, this is so sudden, right, honey?

262
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,480
Having her on a judo team, right, dear?

263
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,480
Her stature, her flexibility, her rhythm...


264
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,450
She possesses incredible qualities in each category.

265
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,990
If I take her under my wing,

266
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,910
it's quite possible she'll win the gold medal in Barcelona!

Tokunaga-san, please take this to our young lady.

273
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,560
Yes, I will do that.

00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,010
All right!

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,820

I want to do more judo with her, just for a little while.

Saikai University?

294
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,040
I know who they are, so just calm down and talk.

295
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,010
Inokuma-san and I are transferring to Saikai University?

296
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,970
S-So that means I can still do judo with Inokuma-san?
