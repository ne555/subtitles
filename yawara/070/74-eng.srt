Wow!

7
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,290
Congratulations!

8
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:47,870
So what will you be selling?

9
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,870
I don't know yet, but I get the feeling they'll put me in the food department.

10
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,630
If that's the case, I don't see you slimming down any time soon.

11
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,890
Where do you want to work, Kyonkyon?

12
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,180
You mean... me?



13
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,140
I'm thinking about working at a pre-school.

14
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,930
A pre-school?

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,000
You'd be perfect for that!

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,580
Some pre-schoolers might be bigger than you!

17
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,190
Hey, listen up!
Some pre-schoolers might be bigger than you!

18
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,690
You'll never guess what I want to be!

19
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,690
A policewoman! Police!

20
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,970
A female cop?

21
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,160
That's cool!

22
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,660
You'll probably be one of those cranky cops.

23
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,200
What do you mean by that?

24
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,960
I feel sorry for anyone who gets a parking ticket from Officer Paddyfield!

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,890
Say that again?

26
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,460
That's enough. So what about you, Marilyn?

27
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,170
Me? I've already said I'm going to be an actress!

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,670
Oh?

29
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,720
So Paddyfield is going to be a policewoman?

30
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,010
That's right.

31
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,730
And she got mad when Marilyn told her she was going to become a scary cop.

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,050
So what are your plans, Yawara?

Really? I wasn't the least bit confused at your age.

38
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,170
Your father proposed to me, permanently employing me as a wife and mother.

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,630
Yeah, yeah, nice story, Mom.

40
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,670
Speaking of Dad...

41
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,900
where is he right now?

42
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,080
I wonder?

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,900
Your father is a man who always took year-long trips.

44
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,400
Year-long trips?

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,380
So what do you think? Will you accept?

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,920
Your parents have also consented to it.

49
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,380
O-Oh.

50
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,890
Won't you try improving your skills at Saikai University, Fujiko-san?

51
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,280
Will you trust me, Yutenji, to hone those skills?

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,090
Yeah, but me? It's just not possible.

53
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,850
Oh, please!

54
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,290
Still, it's certainly a wonderful thought!

55
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,820
I'll get to do judo with Inokuma-san again!

56
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,280
Isn't it?

57
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,680
You must be very happy to have the chance to play judo with her again!

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,580
Y-Yes!

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,870
By the way, Ito Fujiko-san...

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,470
Yes?




61
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,560
What's your weight in kilograms?

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,290
From what I can see...

63
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,320
How could he ask that of a lady?

64
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,480
Probably 65 kilograms!

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,800
Well, you're wrong! I'm only 64 kilos!

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,810
Good! Just lose three kilos for the 61 kg weight class!

67
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,980
I want you to enter

68
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,060
the 61-and-under class for the upcoming All-Japan Selected Judo Championships!

69
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,070
A-All-Japan?!


70
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,590
Your victory in the Ajisai Cup was indeed splendid.

71
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,530
But that was a team competition.

72
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,500
I want you to have an individual record in order to be recommended for transfer to our school.

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,830
But the All-Japan? I can't do that!

74
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,250
Huh?

75
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,040
Your diet starts now!

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,510
If you win the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships,

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,050
then you'll be qualified to go to the World Championships!

78
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,760
W-World Championships?!

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,130
This October, the World Championships will be held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. 

80
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,270
Yugoslavia?

81
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,020
So is Inokuma-san going there too?

82
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,560
Of course!



83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,200
She's the hope of Japan!

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,920
She'll win the All-Japan Selected

85
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,030
and get the gold medal in the 48-and-under class at the World Championships!

86
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,500
Yugoslavia?

87
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,270
It'd be a great place for my post-graduation trip!

88
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,050
Ow! That hurts! Be more gentle!

89
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,510
Huh? This ain't an injury to fuss about, you nitwit!

90
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,230
B-But my bones might've been fractured!


91
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,730
You asked for this with your stupid behavior.

92
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,760
I wasn't being stupid!

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,490
I wanted to save a precious life!

94
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,320
A frog suddenly appeared on the road, and I crashed my bike avoiding it.

95
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,360
This boiled-toad ointment will stop that pain for you.

96
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,380
So you're literally rubbing it in, aren't you?


97
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,890
You were probably sneaking around after something, like the media jackal you are.

98
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,180
I won't put up with slander! I was only after Sayaka'sâ€”

99
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,350
What's Sayaka doing?

100
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,540
Well, it seems that Sayaka's secretly training somewhere.

101
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,110
I wanted to know the location, so I followed her butler, Tokunaga-san.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,940
So she's secretly training? She's wasting her time!





103
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,720
No matter how much blood that heiress sheds in training,

104
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,540
she can't compete with Yawara.

105
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,080
No, you can't afford to be that optimistic.

106
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,590
What? She's got herself some super coach?

107
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,630
He's super, all right, enough to even knock <i>your</i> socks off, Jigoro-san!

108
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,510
Oh?

109
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,450
There aren't any other coaches as good as me.

110
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,130
There is one I can think of...

111
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,060
He's nowhere near my level, but there's my son, Kojiro.

112
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,860
So who is it? Tell me.



113
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,140
I-I can't reveal my scoop!

114
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,240
Fine, let's treat your injury again.

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,660
W-Wait!

116
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,480
So you gonna tell?

117
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,710
I won't tell you!

118
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,660
How about now?

119
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,510
I'm sure this is part of my training.

120
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,970
You need good timing in order to chop wood.

121
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,520
So, are you done?

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,130
So what do you think of my timing and attack interval?

123
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,440
They're fabulous, aren't they?

124
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,540
What the hell does timing or attack intervals have to do with chopping wood?

125
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,530
You can't eat or take baths without chopping wood.

126
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,910
S-So this isn't training?

127
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,960
You know damn well it's not training!

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,210
That was Inokuma Yawara!

178
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,300
Inokuma Yawara, the gold medalist at the Judo World Cup!

179
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,270
Does our company have a judo team, by any chance?

180
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,940
Of course we don't!

181
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,120
Then why did she interview with us?

182
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,970
Forget about that!

183
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,130
Think about what she would mean to this company!

184
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,590
The ad campaigns would practically write themselves!

185
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,160
We need to call the company president!

186
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,000
Set up an emergency staff meeting!

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,670
What should we do with the other interviewees?!


188
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,430
Just breeze through them and call it a day!

I was going to tell her what the interviews are like and how to prepare for them.

198
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,280
They look just like Fujiko-san and Hanazono-kun,

199
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,950
but it can't be them.

200
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,320
You need to go to Saikai U.

201
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,840
If you go, then Inokuma will gladly follow you.

202
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,340
Yes, I agree!

203
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,020
Fujiko-san, are you willing to wait for a bum like me?

204
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,970
Even when you reach the World Championships, I...

205
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,400
I still won't be able to join you on that stage.

206
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,980
Hanazono-san...

207
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,440
But next year, I'm sure...

208
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,470
Hanazono-san!

209
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
Fujiko-san.

210
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,450
It had to be them!

211
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,450
Huh? It couldn't be!

212
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,930
Honestly, you're still in the dark about it.

213
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,710
We've known for a while that those two are a couple!

214
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,810
Hanazono-kun and Fujiko-san?

215
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,220
Oh, here we go!

216
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,070
Why not ask the girl herself?

217
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,310
Good morning!

218
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,760
Hey, Fujiko-san?

219
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,230
Hey, Inokuma-san?

220
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,270
Are you and Hanazono-kun really...

221
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,070
Yugoslavia! For my graduation trip!

222
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,570
Do you want to come with me?

223
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,530
Sir! It was her! It was Inokuma Yawara in the flesh!

I should've got her autograph!

231
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,430
You can get millions off her once we hire her!

232
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,420
Hell, she's the one who wants a job with us anyway!

233
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,420
We're putting her in every one of our commercials!

234
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,430
The rules governing amateurs can be a little tricky, though.

235
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,020
Anyway, sir, if we hire her, it will really boost our company image!

236
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,680
Finally, finally, our time has come.





237
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,600
Honami Travel has always owned the top spot in our industry,

238
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,280
while we at Tsurukame Travel... have always lagged behind.

239
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,390
However, this is our chance to strike back with an Ippon of our own!

240
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,290
Very good, sir, very good!




241
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,300
What's the deal, Fujiko-san?

242
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,300
I mean, a graduation trip to Yugoslavia?

243
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,860
You don't even have time to go on a graduation trip.

244
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,310
She's right. We're supposed to be fighting for jobs.

245
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,450
Hiya!

246
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,320
And what are you doing here?

247
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,760
I'm already on my way to becoming an actress!

248
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,240
I've just been scouted.

249
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,200
I was walking through Harajuku when someone approached me.

250
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,910
I'm playing the starring role!

251
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,540
You won't believe what I'm getting: 500,000 yen!

252
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,960
People must recognize talent when they see it.

253
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,640
Wow, a star actress!

254
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,800
What the hell kind of studio would be so irresponsible?

255
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,110
He gave me his card: Asaka Productions.

257
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,330
Wait, don't they make adult videos?

258
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,220
Are those movies for grown-ups?

259
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,750
Adult? Do you mean...

260
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,770
It might just be!

261
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,230
D-Don't do it, Marilyn! It's too risky!

262
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,780
Don't worry. I'll use a stuntwoman for risky scenes!

263
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,360
I don't think she meant that kind of "risky."

264
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,370
I'd say a rude awakening would be good for her.

265
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,790
Anyway, how's your job search going, Yawara-chan?

266
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,540
Uh, me?

267
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,120
I interviewed with two travel agencies,

268
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,710
and there are two more I'm thinking of trying.

269
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,500
Travel agencies?

That's great!

271
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,800
You'll be able to travel cheaply.

272
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,510
Right?

273
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,010
Travel agencies?

274
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
Y-You can't!

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,020
You can go anywhere in the world without working for those companies!

276
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,200
Oh yeah, what were you saying about Yugoslavia?

277
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,440
The World Championships!

278
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,860
They'll be holding them in Yugoslavia this October!

279
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,740
The World Championships? In what?

280
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,490
Judo, of course!

281
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,950
But we'll be competing in the All-Japan Selected before that!

282
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,760
W-We?

283
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,800
That's right!

284
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,920
That way we will both transfer to Saikai U!

285
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,960

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,180
Why are you transferring me to Saikai U?

291
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,400
I am <i>not</i> going to Saikai U!

292
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,940
And why must I enter the All-Japan Selected Championships?

293
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,870
I already have my hands full with job interviews!

294
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,690
There's no time for judo! And also...

295
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,760
What are you trying to pull by making Fujiko-san buy into that plan?

296
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,700
Fujiko-san is also busy trying to find a job, you know!



297
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,910
It's one thing if it's just me,
 but dragging Fujiko-san into it...

298
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,160
Grandpa, are you listening?

299
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,210
Oh, Yawara, I hear you loud and clear.

300
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,920
And what did you hear?

301
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh. I got too far ahead of myself.

302
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,190
I had no idea you'd be so repulsed by the idea of going to Saikai University.

303
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,430
Here I thought you'd be jumping for joy at that prospect. I'm really sorry.

304
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,440
Grandpa...

305
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,170
I...

306
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,800
No!
I...

307
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,410
Don't say a word, Yawara!

308
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,910
You're an adult now.

309
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,950
You need to choose your own path.

310
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,460
I've caused you years of hardships over judo.

311
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,460
Grandpa.

312
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,870
But you're mistaken about one thing.



313
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,650
Beanpole made up her own mind about going to Saikai University.

314
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,890
She chose to continue playing judo.

315
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,310
She's truly seen the magnificence of judo.

316
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,480
Fujiko-san?

317
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:02,790
But her victory at the Ajisai Cup is only one part of guaranteeing her acceptance to Saikai U.

318
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,480
She also needs to enter the All-Japan Selected Championships

319
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,500
and rack up a bunch of victories there.

320
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,460
If Beanpole enters that huge tournament all by herself, she's sure to lose heart.



321
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,480
I'll give up on your transfer to Saikai University.

322
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,470
But, but at least...

323
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,070
This isn't about me.

324
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:38,570
But can you at least enter the All-Japan Selected for Beanpole's sake?

325
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,380
Grandpa...

326
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,330
It healed!

327
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,120
You're incredible, Master Jigoro!

328
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,910
All the other hospitals said a complete recovery would take two months!

329
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,660
Also, let me straighten out that backbone for you!

330
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,360
Thanks, but no thanks!

331
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,790
Did that just come from the dojo?

332
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,810
Maybe.



333
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,310
Hold on!

334
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,090
I'm checking it out!

335
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,770
I just had to put that media jackal back on his feet.

336
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,280
W-Well, I'll be...

337
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,810
Fujiko-san...

338
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,280
Hang in there!

339
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,290
Un, deux, trois...

340
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,660
Th-They're doing magnificently once again.

341
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,710
As they should.

342
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,880
The All-Japan Selected Championships <i>are</i> imminent, you know.

343
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,090
Kazamatsuri!

344
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,560
Why in God's name are you even here?

345
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,270
You can say a superior coach with his eyes on the All-Japan Selected has arrived on the scene.

346
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,720
Th-The All-Japan... What?

347
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,940
The All-Japan Selected Judo Championships.

348
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,790
For Yawara-san and Fujiko-san.

349
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,070
All right! I have another scoop!

350
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,900
By the way...

351
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,560
have you located Sayaka-san and Kojiro-san yet?

352
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,080
Yawara-san will hear you!

353
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,040
And you'd better not make make that into a newspaper exclusive.

354
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,100
I'd never make an exclusive out of that!

355
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,090
If you ever tell Yawara-san, you'll be sorry!

356
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,300
Unlike you, I am the very essence of delicacy.

357
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,270
Again!

358
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,160
Yeah, this is Inokuma.




359
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,340
We're sorry to keep disturbing you. This is Tsurukame Travel!

360
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,360
Don't you people ever give up?

361
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,320
I already told you that Yawara ain't gonna be working!

362
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,830
But Yawara has already interviewed with our company.


363
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,580
She was just window shopping.

364
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,540
But, can't we meet with her at least once?

365
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,540
Gads! Give it up!

366
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,340
Next Sunday, the company president himself will come and visitâ€”

367
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,180
Next Sunday she has a match.

368
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,020
Yawara ain't going nowhere 'cept Saikai U!

369
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,280
Un... deux... trois!

370
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,200
This is weird.

371
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,870
None of the companies are calling me back.

372
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,300
I guess I did mess up my initial interviews.

373
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,920
She'll win the national title, then move on to the World Championships!

374
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,880
After that, she'll transfer straight to Saikai University!

375
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,220
Headline: Going to the World Championships!!
After that, she'll transfer straight to Saikai University!

376
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,880
Headline: Going to the World Championships!!

377
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,890
Sign: The Barcelona Olympics in 390 Days

378
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,970
Grandpa, did the phone ring just now?

379
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,770
Oh, I dunno about that.

380
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,900
That's just horsebeansâ€” I mean horsefeathers. You're just hearing things.

381
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,080
Grandpa...

382
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,920
Still, why isn't anyone calling me back?

383
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,260
Yawara, what are you bellyaching about? You need to start practicing!

384
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,990
Beanpole ain't gonna sit around waiting, you know!

385
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,770
Yawara!

386
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,830

387
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,120
