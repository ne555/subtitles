1
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,030
Let us handle it, Fujiko-san!

2
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,530
You busted your hump out there!

3
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,700
It's time for us to step up!

4
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,250
Sh-She's right! It's time for us to carry our weight!

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,920
Guys...

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,590
All right, let's get out there and fight!

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,780
Yeah!

8
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,640
The Lightning-Fast Ippon Zeoi

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,030
Ogaki Noriko, 2-dan.


10
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,790
Won the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships. 

11
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,950
Was a national high school champ.

12
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,050
Kurokawa Tomoko, 3-dan.

13
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,450
Second in the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships.

14
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,570
Third in the Fukuoka Kokusai International Championships.

15
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,510
Uzaki Megumi, 2-dan.

16
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,390
Won the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships.

17
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,450
Third in the Fukuoka Kokusai Internationals.

18
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,700
Katori Shinobu, 2-dan.

19
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,760
Won the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships!

20
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,500
Third in the Fukuoka Kokusai Internationals!

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,560
Yamada Kaori, 3-dan.

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,850
Won the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships?!

23
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,050
Won the Fukuoka Kokusai Internationals?!

24
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,560
Book title: Ajisai Cup Women's Judo Tournament

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,670
The Tsukushi team is almost too good!

26
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,460
Right, Fujiko-san?

27
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,450
Fujiko-san!

28
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,140
Y-Yes?


29
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,450
God, weren't you listening?

30
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,320
You were able to beat everybody with just that Ouchi Gari!

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,490
But that's the only move I know!

32
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,860
That's what I'm saying!

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,160
Which means we all can do it if we try!

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,120
She's right! You don't need to be afraid of Tsukushi U!

35
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,440
Don't get nervous just because Fujiko-san won't appear in the finals!

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,170
Run in there screaming!


37
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,880
We're in the middle of a planning session. Will you please keep it down?

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,920
Right.

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,950
I managed to take one of them down the last time we fought.

40
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,510
I've become way better since then.

41
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,350
Three! I'll beat three of them this time!

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,700
Thr...

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,610
Three?


44
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,620
A-Aren't you being a little too confident?

45
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,400
Why not just make it two?

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,800
Shut up, you two!

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,360
Sayuri!

48
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,860
You need to use that body of yours and crush one of them whatever it takes!

49
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,410
I've slimmed down a bit. I wonder if I can actually crush anyone?

50
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,510
That way, we'll get four of them!

51
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,960
All that's left is the captain, whom we'll leave to Yawara-chan.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,630
So you say...




53
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,900
What kind of screwy plan is that?

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,130
Nowhere near normal, that's for sure.

55
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,880
That's right. What about me? It's like I'm not even playing!

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,140
That's not all there is to the plan, Marilyn.

57
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,640
You'll go first, because you have a special assignment.

58
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,640
What is it? Tell me!



59
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,650
You and your usual screwing up will sap their motivation!

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,950
That makes sense!

61
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,860
What do you mean, "That makes sense"?

62
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,780
I'll be able to win against one or two of them!

63
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,430
This will be broadcast live on TV!

64
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,620
U-Um, can I speak?


65
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,200
U-Um, I made some notes on our practice match with Tsukushi University...

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,670
and on their matches today.

67
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,630
Wh-What the...

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,590
Such detailed notes!

69
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,570
So this won't help?

70
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,600
Of course it will!

71
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,810
You've recorded every single one of their signature moves!

72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,810
Do you mean it?

73
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,000
This is amazing, Kyonkyon. We can really use this!

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,990
That's great. It's the only way I can contribute.

75
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,030
What are you saying? You can win too, Kyonkyon!

76
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,540
Inokuma-san.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,030
Let's do our best!

78
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,080
If we each win one, we'll win it all!

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,960
We've come this far. We can do it!

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,470
All right, let's go!

81
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,520
Yeah!

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,180
Yeah.


83
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,180
You've been defeated.

84
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,880
I did <i>not</i> lose. It was a tie.

85
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,660
No, I actually did win that match.

86
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,480
No, that beanpole clearly beat you.

87
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,990
Tokunaga! This car smells like raw fish!

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,000
It's because he's been eating sushi all this time.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,660
Where should we go?

90
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,260
Go where I tell you.

91
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,770
Tokunaga, take me home.
 I'm going to take a shower.

92
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,210
You are <i>not</i> going home!

93
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,400
Keep your eyes on the road, Tokunaga!

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,180
Yes, ma'am!

95
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,720
Please forgive me! Are you hurt?

96
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Oh, I'm fine. I'm sorry for jumping out in front of you.

97
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,690
Has Yawara started her match?

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,660
We've reached the finals at last!

99
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,160
Will Tsukushi U win their sixth consecutive championship?

100
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,940
Or will MWJC, a freshman team of white belts lead by Inokuma Yawara,

101
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,640
All right, let's roll!
Or will MWJC, a freshman team of white belts lead by Inokuma Yawara,

102
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,670
that has fought its way to the finals, win today?
All right, let's roll!

103
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,750
However, Mitsuba's astounding vice captain, Ito Fujiko, is out with an injury, Saito-san.

104
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
Yes, but they still have Inokuma.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,680
As long as Inokuma's in the game, Tsukushi U can't rest easy.

106
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,690
So you <i>do</i> blush whenever we talk about Inokuma, Saito-san.

107
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,300
Don't say that!

108
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,560
The finals have now begun!

109
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,530
Bow to each other!

110
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,530
Don't be cowed. Stare 'em down.

111
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,370
They're all glaring at Yawara-chan!

112
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,670
All right, listen up! Our only opponent is Inokuma Yawara!

113
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,710
Don't waste time clearing out the other runts! Got it?

114
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,170
Yeah!

115
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,400
What did they just say?

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,420
Paddyfield, listen.

117
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,870
According to Kyonkyon's notes,

118
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,150
their first player is Ogaki-san.

119
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,070
Her signature move is the Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi.

120
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,470
Marilyn, let's spar for a bit.





121
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,980
Okay!

122
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,140
This is what the Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi will look like.

123
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,420
When that happens, pull your right foot away,

124
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,530
and when she's whiffing with her foot, do an Ashi Barai!

125
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,310
Yawara! Quit messing around and start your stretching exercises!

126
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,410
Master Inokuma.

127
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,510
So it finally begins.

128
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,860
Yutenji, your school lost to Tsukushi U rather pathetically.

129
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,700
Did you cry?

130
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,960
Yes. But next year will be different, because...

131
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Because?

132
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,320
...because Yawara-san and Ito Fujiko-san will be coming to Saikai University!

133
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,600
So the weeping crow will soon laugh.

134
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,720
Good luck!

135
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,740
Hang in there, guys!
Good luck!

136
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,350
Hang in there, guys!

137
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,350
I know you can do it!

138
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,970
Fujiko-san and Yawara-san will be going to Saikai University?

139
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,400
No way.

140
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,440
And we now begin the match!

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,370
Tsukushi U's first player is Ogaki!

142
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,060
She's on a roll, having defeated four competitors in the first round,

143
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,690
two in the quarters, and three in the semis!

144
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,700
Facing her will be Mitsuba's first player... Whoa! It's Oda Mari!

145
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,510
Bow!



146
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,330
Will this match end before it begins?

147
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,090
Marilyn, don't let her grab you too quickly!

148
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,300
Remember, you're supposed to sap their motivation!

149
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,620
Ogaki, finish her in five seconds!

150
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,300
No, three!

151
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,250
Hajime!

152
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,850
Um, a Sasae Tsuri... What again?

153
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,860
Ippon! Done!

154
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,630
The all-powerful Ogaki!

155
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,280
A two-second win by Ippon. Very strong indeed!

156
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,320
Inokuma-san.

157
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,580
Can we rehearse once more?

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,290
Okay, pull your right foot away. No, faster!

159
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,900
We won't lose. We will not lose!

160
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,540
We worked too hard!

161
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,580
That's it!

162
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,300
Okay, show 'em what you got!

163
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,650
Mm-hmm!

164
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,320
Here's MWJC's second player, the heavyweight Yoshinaga Sayuri!

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,220
Wait, I mean Yoshinagawa Sayuri!

166
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,790
Inokuma-san.

167
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,940
I'm next.

168
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,940
Please help me too.

169
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,980
Kyonkyon.

170
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,990
I want to win!


171
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,600
You took too long in the bathroom. The match has already started!

172
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,780
Oh, right.

173
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,960
Excuse me, how is the match going?

174
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,660
Oh, the championship match between Tsukushi U and MWJC is just starting!

175
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,180
And it's all thanks to our daughter's fine performance!

176
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,970
Honey, your flag's at half-mast.

177
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,890
My, how amazing!

178
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,430
I beg your pardon, but would you tell me your daughter's name?

179
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,350
That would be Ito Fujiko!

180
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,940
Ah, Fujiko-san!

181
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,560
She's always looking out for my Yawara.

182
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,810
Huh? You're Yawara-san's mother?

183
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,690
Actually, it's your daughter who looks out for Fujiko.

184
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,280
We have to hurry! The match will be over!

185
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,120
No, you need to fend her off more quickly! Then do an Ashi Barai!

186
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,420
Okay!

187
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,970
Now, again!

188
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,340
Yes, that's the timing, Kyonkyon!

189
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,340
Okay!

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Ippon!

191
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
The mighty Ogaki of Tsukushi U! Two wins in an instant!

192
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,640
You're up, Kyonkyon!

193
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,310
Okay.




194
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,320
Don't fret. Just take 'em down, Kyonkyon!

195
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,820
Get them back for us!

196
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,280
Okay!

197
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,620
Inokuma-san, I...

198
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,420
I've never felt this thrilled before.

199
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,130
I've never felt this excited.

200
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,090
I'm really glad I started judo.

201
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,080
Kyonkyon...

202
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,230
And here's MWJC's third player, Hikage Kyoko.

203
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,100
Weighing in at just 36 kg, she has no hope of winning.



204
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,060
What a truly unfavorable development for MWJC!

205
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,820
Ogaki, get rid of her in a second!

206
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,520
All you need to do is yell at her!

207
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,190
Kyonkyon, relax!

208
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,030
Bite her if you have to!

209
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,030
Yawara-chan, can you spar with me?

210
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,420
Yes, pull harder!

211
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,180
Kyonkyon will win, right?

212
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,560
Don't worry. She will!

213
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,500
Yes, faster!

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,600
Hajime!

218
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,340
She staggers as she's grabbed!

219
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,610
Will Hikage be all right?

220
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,110
Don't waste time with her! Beat her already!

221
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,030
Here comes Ogaki's Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi!

222
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,500
Just like Inokuma-san showed me...

223
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,290
Koka!

224
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,910
All right!

225
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,170
It's a Koka! A Koka!

226
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,800
Hikage, of all people, scored a Koka off Ogaki!

227
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,810
Oh! But no sooner did she fall than Ogaki went for an Osaekomi!

228
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,310
Get away, Kyonkyon!

229
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,770
She almost gave me a heart attack!

230
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,810
That's good! Keep it up!

231
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,320
Kyonkyon, get her leg!

232
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,820
Hikage holds on for dear life!



233
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,740
Gotta love her progress!

234
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,780
That isn't just progress.

235
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,340
That's actual judo!

236
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,040
Kyonkyon is actually playing judo!

237
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,540
You dumb cluck! What are you dawdling for?!

238
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,590
There it is. She's finally got her!

239
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,510
There's Ogaki's Tate Shihoh Gatame!

240
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,250
She's done for!

241
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,010
Don't give up, Kyonkyon! Put up a fight!

242
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,990
Please, get away!

243
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,520
Ippon! Done!


244
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,000
And Ogaki beats her third opponent in thirty seconds!

245
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,100
Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong with Mitsuba?

246
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,690
D-Don't worry. Inokuma-san's daughter will pull through!

247
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,460
Right, Madam?

248
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,000
Uh, yes.

249
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,390
Stay strong, Yawara.

250
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,050
I'm sure your father is watching nearby.


251
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,610
It's like that show-off Inokuma Yawara planned this all out.

252
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,350
Don't be like that.


253
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,020
You can eat this while watching.

254
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,480
I'm sure you can't wait to see how your daughter performs.

255
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,780
You did great, Kyonkyon!

256
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,990
A Koka is nothing to sneeze at!

257
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,660
I'm...


258
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,640
so mad!

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Huh?

260
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,010
I never thought I'd be so angry about losing.

261
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,010
You're darn right.

262
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,290
I get pissed when a guy rejects me.

263
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,510
I get pissed when I lose at judo.

264
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,430
I hate being pissed, so I'll do my utmost!

265
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,610
That's the way, Paddyfield!

266
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,470
Please beat them!

267
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,940
Yeah!

268
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,210
Guys...

269
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,360
Mitsuba is now down to their vice captain, Minamida Yoko!

270
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,490
They're down to their last hope!

271
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,450
Hajime!

272
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,470
Minamida madly rushes in!

273
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,330
She clearly doesn't want to give Ogaki her fourth win!

274
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,920
I'll get you! I'll definitely beat you!

275
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Ogaki calmly handles Minamida's forceful charge!

276
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,470
Get out of my sight!


277
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,470
Here it is!

278
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,270
Shinji, you jerkwad!

279
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,730
Yuko!

280
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,510
Jougai! Mate!

281
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,590
You did it, Paddyfield!

282
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,240
Get her again!

283
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,150
You can do it, Paddyfield!

284
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,740
Keep at it!

285
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,740
Damn, I almost had you.

286
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,750
Hey, stupid! Why is she giving you trouble?!

287
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,710
She's not supposed to be capable of that!

288
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,250
Yes, sir!

289
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:26,710
Hajime!

290
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,760
Note: Sazae Tsuboyaki are shellfish cooked in their shells.
Give me your Sasae Tsurikomi, Sazae Tsuboyaki, or whatever!

291
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Don't let her grab your back collar!

292
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,020
Ippon!

293
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,640
Done!

294
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,780
She won! An Uchi Mata Ippon!


295
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,690
Ogaki gets her fourth victory!

296
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,290
Yes! That's the way!

297
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:52,560
Good going, Ogaki!

298
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,650
Finally, it's time!
Good going, Ogaki!

299
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,870
Now that Ogaki has beaten four players, it means...

300
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,660
Yes...

301
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,830
The time has finally come.

302
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,660
Th-That's right. She finally gets to play!

303
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,080
This is an incredible development!

304
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,940
The champion, Tsukushi U, still retains all five players!

305
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,630
All according to plan!

306
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,720
All right, people, things have changed!

307
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,640
You're the top team in the nation, so crush her any way you can!

308
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,140
Yeah!

309
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,970
Paddyfield.

310
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,150
I'm so pissed!

311
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,950
Inokuma-san?

312
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,860
Yawara-chan?

313
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,150
Inokuma-san?



314
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,430
Inokuma Yawara will have to face those five all by herself!

315
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,910
It's now literally a five to one match!

316
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,290
Inokuma-san is facing five by herself! What do we do?

317
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,380
This isn't the time for that! Inokuma will do it!

318
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,920
I'm so useless!

319
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,610
If only I hadn't been injured, I...




320
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,770
I can't help Inokuma-san at all!

321
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,410
Wait, you're the one who brought her back to judo.

322
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,100
That's the most you could've done for her!

323
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,180
Hanazono-san!

324
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,140
Fujiko-san!

325
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,400
Break it up! I swear, you two...

326
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,000
M-Mother...


327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,080
I don't want you calling me "Mother"!

328
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,360
Y-Yes, Mother!

329
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,410
But Hanazono-san is right.

330
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,370
It's thanks to Fujiko-san that Yawara is back playing judo!

331
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,330
Thank you, Fujiko-san.

332
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,720
Yawara has a wonderful friend.

333
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,380
Oh, please...

334
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,380
Mom, you came!

335
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,380
Do your best, Yawara. Do it for your wonderful friends.

336
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,080
I also have some good news.

337
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,390
Your father is close by.

338
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,000
White sign: Kandacho Shopping District
Red sign: Oden

339
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,490
There's an oden shop under Kanda Bridge that he used to frequent.
White sign: Kandacho Shopping District
Red sign: Oden

340
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,400
The owner told me this:
White sign: Kandacho Shopping District
Red sign: Oden

341
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,860
Your father showed up unexpectedly about a week ago!

342
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,320
This should settle it.

343
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,330
Your judo didn't keep him from coming back.

344
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,450
In fact, it's the opposite!

345
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,890
Your father's nearby whenever you play judo, whether it's here or in Seoul.

346
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,040
He's right.

347
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,460
I'm sure your father is nearby, watching over you.

348
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,590
Kazamatsuri!

349
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,970
I guarantee it.

350
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,950
You didn't leave with Honami Sayaka?


351
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,940
And I'm also watching over you.

352
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,020
Now, relax and play your match.

353
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,220
Mr. High'n Mighty!

354
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,810
Hey, what are you gabbing about?
 The referee's calling you, lunkhead!

355
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,320
Now, get going. Get out there and beat those five!

356
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,220
Right! I'm going!

357
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,910
Um, Inokuma-san!

358
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,290
Write the word "person" on your palm and eat it.

359
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,290
Kyonkyon.

360
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,300
Good luck.

361
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,130
Here comes Inokuma Yawara!

362
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,100
What do you think, Saito-san? Can Inokuma beat five?

363
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,820
Well, I really can't say anything yet.

364
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,450
Winning against five is next to impossible.

365
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,670
Plus Tsukushi has had a near-perfect year,

366
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,110
thanks to their huge, physically imposing players.

367
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,480
Even Inokuma booster Saito-san looks unsure.



368
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,960
But Tsukushi U does have its share of heavyweight players.

369
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,430
And Yawara, weighing in at 48 kg, is a lightweight!

370
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,860
Bow!

371
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,330
Hajime!

372
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,130
Ogaki!

373
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,600
Don't sweat it. We've got five on our side!

374
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,420
Fight her knowing it's five to one!

375
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,090
You five will bring the undefeated Inokuma to her knees!

376
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,640
Yes, she grabbed a sweet spot!

377
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,600
Don't let her grab your arm!
 She's coming with an Ippon Zeoi!

378
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,060
Inokuma-san...

379
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,940
Inokuma-san, hang in there!

380
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,190
Ippon!

381
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,110
Done!

382
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,080
There it is! Inokuma's lightning-fast Ippon Zeoi!

383
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,580
Oh... Oh my gosh!

384
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,500
All right!



385
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,630
You two, break it up, then celebrate!

386
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,130
I-I'm sorry.

387
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,590
It's fine, it's fine. All according to plan!

388
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,090
You did great, Ogaki. You fulfilled your duty wonderfully!

389
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,290
The fight's not over yet.
 Now get out there, Kurokawa!

390
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,100
Right!

391
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,800
Holy cow! That's our Yawara-chan!

392
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,600
That was so cool!

393
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,530
Um, Kurokawa-san, let's see... won three times with a Harai Goshi.

394
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,620
Thank you, Kyonkyon.

395
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,610
Good luck out there, Inokuma-san!



396
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,040
Here's the second player, runner-up in the All-Japan Selected Judo Championships,

397
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,580
third-place finisher in the Fukuoka Kokusai Internationals, Kurokawa Tomoko!

398
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,730
Bow!

399
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,580
Hajime!


400
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,890
Kurokawa, run the clock!
 You need to wear her out!

401
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,340
We still have the advantage. Don't plunge in needlessly!

402
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,900
Yes, lower your stance!

403
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,640
Now she won't get an arm or a leg in!

404
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,060
Ouchi Gari!

405
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,100
Kurokawa fends it off- No, wait!

406
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,600
Don't let her!

407
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,060
Kurokawa's resisting her! She's not giving up an Ippon Zeoi!

408
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Ippon!

409
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
Yay, Yawara-chan!

410
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,650
Osoto Otoshi! 

411
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,200
Yawara is lightning quick! Two moves in the blink of an eye!

412
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,380
A-All according to plan!

413
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,880
It's not over! Not by a long shot!

415
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,470
Yawara! You're facing a bunch of worthless bums,

416
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,400
so don't waste more than a second on any of 'em!

417
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,860
Dad's watching me, isn't he?

418
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,330
Dang it! Are you listening?

419
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,110
Everybody did their best today, so I'm not going to lose!



420
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,190
Looks like you finally have some fire in your belly.

421
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,960
Yawara!

422
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,410
