1
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,680
You freakin' bitchass!

2
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,100
What the hell!

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,370
We're ready for the getaway.

4
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,280
Where's the shit?

5
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,610
It's right here.

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,540
I'm your new recipient.

7
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,630
The other guy is fish
food in Tokyo harbor.

8
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,700
Like... oh my gosh!

9
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,600
Is this a traffic jam or what?

10
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,970
Totally uncool, dude!

11
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,270
Quit talking like a fag!

12
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,250
But...

13
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,360
Ryo-chan's been hanging around
babelicious high school girls lately.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,850
Ryo!

15
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,500
You damn paedophilic pervert!
You've gone too far this time!

16
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,650
I'm just kidding, woman!

17
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,310
Stop PMS-ing already!
You're screwing with my mokkori power.

18
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,650
I'm surprised you were able to
swing that thing inside this small car.

19
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,550
I've got skillz.

20
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,320
It's hard to believe that you're
one of the best in the underworld.

21
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,070
Well, you don't look too tough serving
coffee at the Cat's Eye either, Falcon.

22
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,650
That's just my cover.

23
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,450
Don't compare me to this dorkass.

24
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,750
You guys are fighting again?

25
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,270
Miki-chan, why don't you dump
Mr. Clean here and be my partner instead?

26
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,930
Ryo!

27
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,560
You don't need another partner,
I treat you well, don't I?

28
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,860
Sure...

29
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,000
Train #197 on Rail 18 will be
departing for Okayama shortly.

30
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,900
All passengers for this
train should now board.

31
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,240
Please!

32
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,970
I'll give you as much money
as you want. Just let me go!

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,550
You can't bribe me.

34
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,510
You're useless to me
and the organization.

35
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,980
The boss says he is very
disappointed in you.

36
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,610
Jesus, we've been
stuck here forever.

37
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,810
Don't these people have anywhere
better to go for Golden Week?

38
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,670
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,890
With this depression and all,
Sea Firefly is the best vacation spot.

40
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,620
There's an
Umihotaru right here!

41
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,380
Look at it glow!

42
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,690
I'm called Umibozu.

43
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,880
Spare me...

44
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,120
It won't be long now.

45
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,710
We've already started
the television takeover.

46
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,460
Traitors like you...

47
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,190
...can watch us from hell!

48
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,730
Hey, honeymelons!

49
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,170
Can I get your number?

50
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll show you heaven at this hotel!

51
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,040
Hey, bring your DSL my way...

52
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,170
Wanna lick that
ice cream off me?

53
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,390
Sure.

54
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,000
Wear it!

55
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,170
The sea breeze sure feels good!

56
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,040
Yeah.

57
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,600
A helicopter from MegaCity TV.

58
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,210
Oh, that station with H Jungle?

59
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,580
No, you moron.

60
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,410
The new TV station that media
king, Jack Douglas, created.

61
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,080
Media King...

62
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,520
They say he's worth
a couple billion yen.

63
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,120
I want a couple billion yen.

64
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,640
Oh yeah!

65
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,560
Ryo, we can't just
hang out here.

66
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,260
It's been four months
since we've had a job.

67
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,050
We've broken our old record
of three months and a week.

68
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,280
It's a new unemployment streak!

69
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,610
We really need to find a client.

70
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,790
We need a client!

71
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,910
Good work.

72
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,320
Emergency Live Broadcast!?

73
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:31,350
The Death of Evil Ryo Saeba
Emergency Live Broadcast!?

74
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,830
Subtitles by Team ABCB

75
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes!

76
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,560
Finally, a client after four
months and three days!

77
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,130
Good evening.

78
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,800
MegaCity TV presents
Mega Pop News.

79
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,220
My name is Sayaka Asagiri.

80
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,890
All right! Saya-pii!

81
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,740
Go girl!

82
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,700
Hordes of vacation goers have
flocked to the Sea Firefly today...

83
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,040
...the first day of Golden Week.

84
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,240
Here is some footage of the busy
area from our satellite camera.

85
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,800
You can clearly see the traffic
congestion around the Sea Firefly area.

86
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,380
Oh shit.

87
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,450
They were taping me?

88
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,390
I had no idea.

89
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,650
Those satellites can zoom
in pretty damn close.

90
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,670
More news to come after a
word from our sponsors.

91
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,380
Ryo, it's me!

92
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,540
Open the door!

93
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,140
What the homie!

94
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,280
Sayaka's sexy announcements
just got ruined...

95
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,150
...by Kaori's nasty voice!

96
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,620
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,900
I'm coming!

98
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,560
Oh...

99
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,670
...my...

100
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,960
...freakin' God!

101
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,430
Ryo, we have a client.

102
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,140
My apologies for
keeping you waiting.

103
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
He's fast.

104
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,300
Come in!

105
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,910
Hey, wait!

106
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,650
Ryo, open the damn door!

107
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,870
Now, let's leave
that child alone...

108
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,260
...and enjoy this time we
have together as adults.

109
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,710
Such a...

110
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,080
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

111
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,550
...woman like yourself...

112
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,630
...will be treated tenderly by
a gentleman like myself.

113
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,010
I can't even let my guard
down for a second with you!

114
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,470
It so happens that this
lady needs our help.

115
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,630
I see.

116
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,200
Sorry.

117
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,760
But, I don't work for chicks
who hide their faces.

118
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,340
Wait, Ryo!

119
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,160
This is our first job
in four months.

120
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,350
Very well.

121
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,550
Sa...

122
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,120
Saya-pii!

123
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
NO WAY!

124
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,080
YES FREAKIN' WAY!

125
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,290
Saya-pii, in the flesh.

126
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,770
Sorry, but I don't think
he can handle this job.

127
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,110
He's a little distracted by you.

128
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,050
Heaven...

129
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,010
Heaven on legs!

130
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,590
Heaven...

131
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,120
Heaven on legs!

132
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,290
Kaori!

133
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,730
You just told me
to accept this job!

134
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,960
It's been four months. We can't
be picky with the requests we get!

135
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,650
You're right.

136
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,230
I guess it's okay.

137
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,380
Now, for tomorrow's weather.

138
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,600
But, wait...

139
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,240
Isn't this being filmed live?

140
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,350
No, what you're seeing now is
footage from previous newscasts.

141
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,140
They edit the clothing and mouth
movements with computers.

142
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,550
Their technology makes it easy.

143
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,500
Do you trust me now?

144
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,860
Oh hell yeah!

145
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,340
I mean, but of course.

146
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,890
So, what does the beloved
newscaster, Sayaka Asagiri...

147
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,440
...need help with from
a hot guy like me?

148
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,550
I want you to protect me.

149
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,820
Protect you?

150
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,100
Yes.

151
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,020
I want you to protect my life.

152
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,620
Hell yeah!

153
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,670
In the shower! In bed!
I'll protect you 24-7!

154
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,840
Asshole!

155
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,100
So, you want a bodyguard.

156
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,260
How much are you paying?

157
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,250
Oh, yeah.

158
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,630
I was thinking this
would be enough.

159
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,700
Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand...

160
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,980
A hundred thousand!

161
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,230
WOO HOO!

162
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,300
Five zeros!

163
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,100
All right, Kaori!

164
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,830
We're finally getting
paid after four months!

165
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,490
And another thing...

166
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,800
My body is all yours
for one night.

167
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,920
HOLY SHIT!

168
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,380
WHAT THE FUCK?

169
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,950
I hope you're UP for it.

170
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,320
Of course, this is
only if you succeed.

171
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,400
I'll be UP for it all night!

172
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,270
It's a deal then.

173
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,810
We start now!

174
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,100
Hey!

175
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,640
The Ryo Saeba Special,
Lovey-Dovey Handcuffs!

176
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,170
There's sponge on the
inside so it won't hurt you.

177
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,880
Now we can be
cuddly day and night!

178
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,470
So, that's what he was making
this whole time he stayed in.

179
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,260
You freak!
Take those off!

180
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,650
Can't do it.

181
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,070
We seem to be stuck now.

182
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,590
RYO!

183
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,800
Gimme those keys!

184
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,620
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

185
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,400
Gimme those damn keys!

186
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,460
Drink this laxative, damn it!

187
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,500
Oh god!

188
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Can you please
just shit it out?

189
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,660
Are you done yet?

190
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,230
Nope, not yet.

191
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,330
Can you please hurry?

192
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:29,980
Nope.

193
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,300
Not yet.

194
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,350
Are you done yet?

195
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,260
Who?

196
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,730
He's gone.

197
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,180
He disappeared as soon as
he knew he missed his target.

198
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,740
He's a pro.

199
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,780
It seems your life
really is in danger.

200
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,050
Why would I lie about it?

201
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
Please protect me.

202
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,170
Can you tell us everything?

203
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,520
I'd like to know everything about
someone I have to protect.

204
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,670
Your pants, Ryo.

205
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,630
Ryo Jr. is so cute!

206
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,650
You like?

207
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,330
I am Sayaka Asagiri
from MegaCity News...

208
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,570
...bringing you the evening report.

209
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,250
They...

210
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,940
They killed the company president.

211
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,550
The president of MegaCity TV?

212
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,440
The media king, Jack Douglas?

213
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,130
I stumbled upon the scene
and saw them kill him.

214
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,730
The murderer was the president's
right-hand man. They call him Mad Dog.

215
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,920
The name suits him well.

216
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,660
They're using the computer
editing program...

217
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,000
...to make it seem like the
president is still alive.

218
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,960
And they plan on keeping all of the
company profits to themselves.

219
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,810
So, they're abusing
the computer program.

220
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,880
This just in.

221
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,640
Today, at 8:14 AM on the 197
train leaving to Okayama...

222
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,590
...the body of Ichirou Kurokawa, the secretary of
MegaCity TV's president, was found onboard.

223
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,980
The autopsy is still underway...

224
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,050
...but initial reports indicate that a heart
attack may have been the cause of death.

225
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,070
The weather is next.

226
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,230
Please turn the TV off!

227
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,580
All the management staff of
MegaCity TV wear this ring.

228
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,490
This ring has a deadly secret.

229
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,940
It emits a radio wave...

230
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,060
...that the MegaCity TV
control room receives.

231
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,470
When the wearer travels outside
the range of the radio waves...

232
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,130
...it automatically releases
poison into their blood.

233
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,300
If I try to run from this city...

234
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,080
...the poison from the
ring will kill me.

235
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,400
The poison leaves
no trace behind.

236
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,800
The symptoms are identical
to a heart attack.

237
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,130
Mad Dog keeps us all
in line with this ring.

238
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,700
How horrible.

239
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,320
But effective.

240
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,600
So, how far do the
radio waves go?

241
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,270
About as far as the city limits.

242
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,030
That means...

243
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,470
I can't leave this city.

244
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,530
The police can't help me.

245
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,530
I can't hide anywhere.

246
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,090
Mad Dog's men will trace
the radio wave down.

247
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,080
Please.

248
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,440
You're my only hope, City Hunter.

249
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,720
Please...

250
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,640
Protect me.

251
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,830
I have a bad feeling about this.

252
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,550
Hey, Ryo, where do you
think you're taking us?

253
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,020
If you're being chased
the safest place to hide...

254
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,460
...is in a crowd.

255
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,740
I found Ryo-chan!

256
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,490
Ryo-chan come over.

257
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,810
No come over to my place.

258
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,520
We can have fun at our place.

259
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,320
RYO!

260
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,910
Are girls all you think about?

261
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,340
Boing!

262
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,450
Ryo-chan, long time no see.

263
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,540
Were you just gonna pass by
my place without saying hi?

264
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,930
I'll...

265
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,110
...throw in some extra service.

266
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,770
You're coming over, right?

267
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,240
Hey, wait up!

268
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,940
Ryo-chan!

269
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,830
Target sighted.

270
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,710
The target is moving
towards 2nd Avenue.

271
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,580
Switch to Camera B.

272
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,850
Zoom in on Ryo Saeba
and Sayaka Asagiri.

273
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:30,790
Yes, sir.

274
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,740
Delete the drag queen's hand.

275
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,630
Show his right hand.

276
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,460
Yes, sir.

277
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,880
Put a knife in it.

278
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,760
Yes, sir.

279
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,340
Now the face.

280
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,170
Make him look evil.

281
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,680
Ryo-chan!

282
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,960
Why don't you stay over
at my place tonight?

283
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,060
I'm so lonely.

284
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,810
Sorry.

285
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,000
I have to be somewhere tonight.

286
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,040
Bye.

287
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,020
Fine, be that way.

288
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,390
Falcon, come here quick!

289
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,610
Another cockroach?

290
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,570
Look.

291
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,730
Saeba-san's on TV.

292
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,700
Be on the watch for this man!!
Popular newscaster kidnapped

293
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,620
MegaCity News' Sayaka Asagiri has been
missing since the 20th of this month...
Be on the watch for this man!!
Popular newscaster kidnapped

294
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,640
MegaCity News' Sayaka Asagiri has been
missing since the 20th of this month...

295
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,730
...ever since she left the studio.

296
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,390
And on the 22nd, it has become clear
that she was a victim of kidnapping.

297
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,660
These images of Sayaka and her kidnapper
were unexpectedly caught on tape...

298
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,950
...by a news crew in Shinjuku.

299
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,510
Oh man, I slept well.

300
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,540
What the...

301
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,130
I saw them together wearing
Lovey-Dovey Handcuffs.

302
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,960
It makes me so jealous!

303
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,070
The kidnapper's name is Ryo Saeba.

304
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,710
Wait a sec, what's going on?

305
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,160
Damn, I'm all famous now?

306
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,370
You mean notorious, you fool!

307
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:47,210
MegaCity TV has increased its manpower
to find the kidnapper, Ryo Saeba.

308
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,870
What's going on?

309
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,050
I'm confused.

310
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,960
I'm going out for awhile.

311
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,810
Falcon!

312
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,580
You're still wearing your apron.

313
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,630
We finally got the
kidnapper's identity...

314
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,630
Ryo Saeba.

315
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,880
He has no record with the police and
nothing of his past could be found.

316
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,600
His past is shrouded in mystery.

317
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,770
But, Daddy...

318
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,600
Don't call me Daddy!

319
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,550
Family does not exist
in the workplace!

320
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,900
I understand, Commissioner.

321
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,920
It's just that...

322
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,340
It's hard to believe that a
man who looks this dumb...

323
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,960
...could successfully kidnap
a famous newscaster.

324
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,730
I think being a peeping tom or an
underwear thief is more in his league.

325
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,240
But, I have a feeling I've seen this
lecherous face somewhere before.

326
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,230
Yeah, you see lecherous people like
this all the time nowadays, huh?

327
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,740
Every news station is trying
to find out where this guy is.

328
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,680
It would be embarrassing
if we don't find him first.

329
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,670
Do whatever it takes
to catch this man!

330
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,270
That is a direct order
from the Commissioner.

331
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,780
Yes, sir.

332
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:16,980
Punkass Ryo.

333
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,090
What's he thinking?

334
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,070
Python .357.

335
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,750
Same as Ryo's.

336
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,530
I smell perfume.

337
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,600
This scent!

338
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,080
It can't be!

339
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,880
Yo, that looks like him!

340
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,050
Yeah, that's him!

341
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,950
Aren't you attracting
too much attention?

342
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,130
You were on TV
as a kidnapper.

343
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,730
It's all good.

344
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,250
I'm not all scary
looking like on TV.

345
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,530
Right, Saya-pii?

346
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:23,780
Sure.

347
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,770
Let's jet!

348
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,430
Ryo!

349
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,240
Don't let them get away!

350
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,690
Right!

351
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,690
Hey!

352
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,830
That's the kidnapper!

353
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,060
It's Saya-pii!

354
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,000
They're getting away!

355
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,370
MOKKORI LARIAT!

356
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,790
Are you all right?

357
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,420
Yeah.

358
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,390
Ryo, where are we headed?

359
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,090
Get down!

360
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,460
Dammit, they got away.

361
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,240
The ring's frequency is back.

362
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,890
They're exiting the subway.

363
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,510
Hi, it's me!

364
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,300
The famous Ryo Saeba!

365
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,730
Hi everyone!

366
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,610
We don't have time to
be greeting the public!

367
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,760
Hi hi, everyone, bye-bye!

368
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,830
We've filmed Ryo Saeba.

369
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,640
Put a gun in his hand.

370
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,590
Yes, sir.

371
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,440
It's finished.

372
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,180
Now switch over now to
the night-vision camera.

373
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,100
Yes, sir.

374
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,840
Boss...

375
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,510
So, you two are on
your honeymoon?

376
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,160
Yup.

377
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,350
We're still lovin' it up.

378
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,480
Oh this?

379
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,650
Instead of a ring, handcuffs
are in style nowadays.

380
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,140
Really?

381
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,430
You young kids are so strange.

382
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,960
And who's the other person?

383
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,500
My brother, my little brother.

384
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,200
Whoa!

385
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,630
Little bro, I'll meet you back here.

386
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,400
Let's get going!

387
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,590
Wait a sec! That's the women's bath!

388
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,070
But, I'm handcuffed
to her, remember?

389
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,280
Ryo!

390
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,300
Bite through it if you have to!

391
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,490
Okay already!

392
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,310
Here!

393
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,260
Dammit, you had
the key all along?

394
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,240
So lonely.

395
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,570
Here, two people.

396
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,850
Hey kid, men go
to the other side.

397
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,250
What was that? I'm a woman!

398
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,710
I'll show you proof!

399
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,800
Here! How's this?

400
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,480
What are you staring at?

401
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,840
Dammit!

402
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,470
Ryo's such a slacker.

403
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,680
This is a job. I wish he
would get serious.

404
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,280
Has he always been like this?

405
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,450
Ever since I can remember.

406
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,160
What about before
you were partners?

407
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,370
Huh? I don't know.

408
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,140
He doesn't like to talk about his past.

409
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,670
My brother never told me
much about him either.

410
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,130
Oh.

411
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,610
Mokkori Energy detected.

412
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,410
Take this!

413
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,920
Sheeyit!

414
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,210
I couldn't see through
all the freakin' steam.

415
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,990
I'm not one to give up so easily!

416
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,230
No peeking!

417
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,990
Nice try.

418
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,830
Sheeyit!

419
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,460
If you hang your underwear like this, it'll keep the perverts out.

420
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,500
Too bad there's already
a pervert in the room.

421
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,120
Huh?

422
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,260
What are you talking about?

423
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,100
Don't play dumb!

424
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,290
While you were doing that...

425
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,990
...you stole Sayaka-san's bra!

426
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,580
What the hell?

427
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,550
That's strange. How'd that
get into my pocket?

428
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,590
We've got Ryo Saeba on tape,
we're sending the image.

429
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,930
MegaCity News retrieved
footage of two men...

430
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,500
...whom Ryo Saeba mercilessly murdered
while eluding the police.

431
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,570
How frightening.

432
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,370
Seeing that the victims weren't robbed,
the guy must be some sort of psycho.

433
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,580
This footage just in.

434
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,500
MegaCity staff has just
located Ryo Saeba.

435
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,870
Wait!

436
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,440
That man...

437
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,170
He's in our house.

438
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,010
To Officer 109...

439
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,720
...we've located the apartment
that Ryo Saeba is in.

440
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,360
Hurry to Grand Chateau
Ayakouji immediately.

441
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,640
Repeat, hurry to Grand Chateau
Ayakouji immediately.

442
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,040
Roger!

443
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,480
Grand Chateau Ayakouji

444
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,850
What the hell is so
"Grand Chateau" about this place?

445
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,070
This footage is live.

446
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,710
Saeba-san?

447
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,780
The moon's full tonight!

448
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,930
That's him alright.

449
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,410
What the hell are you doing, Ryo?

450
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,260
I'm just greeting all the TV viewers.

451
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,260
No one wants to be greeted...

452
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,760
...by your ugly ass!

453
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,480
Jesus Christ Superstar!

454
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,020
Can't you be a little more serious?

455
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,930
This part of my body is VERY serious!

456
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,970
That's not funny!

457
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,870
Those footsteps...

458
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,050
This is the police.

459
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,750
We want to ask a few questions.

460
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,500
That voice...

461
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,540
The door's open, babe.

462
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,110
I thought it was her.

463
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,640
What is the relation
between you three?

464
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,000
Can't you tell?

465
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,230
Us two are honeymooners...

466
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,190
...and this is my brother.

467
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,620
Don't be stupid.

468
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,380
Ryo Saeba...

469
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,760
You're under arrest.

470
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,960
He's getting away!

471
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,220
Inspector Nogami!

472
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,770
He escaped through
that hole. Get him!

473
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,030
Yes, ma'am!

474
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,580
What a freak.

475
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,050
Nice ass!

476
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,840
Saeko!

477
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,300
You over there.

478
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,430
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,110
Take these two somewhere safe.

480
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:48,990
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,750
Please come with me.

482
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,000
They are in good hands.

483
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,440
Saeko-chan!

484
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,170
Please take the passenger seat.

485
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,580
Ryo!

486
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,980
Three's a crowd, little brother. Let us
have our time alone together.

487
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,700
What?

488
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,450
Later!

489
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,580
Wait!

490
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,980
RYO!

491
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,370
When I get my hands on you, I'll crush
Ryo Jr. with my hammer!

492
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,610
You remember that!

493
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,950
With that obstacle gone...

494
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,610
...let's enjoy this time
together, Saya-pii!

495
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,340
You're a terrible liar.

496
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,240
If she stayed with us...

497
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,740
...her life would be in
danger along with ours.

498
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,270
That's why you left her, right?

499
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,610
You care about her that much?

500
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,620
This job doesn't involve her.

501
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,560
The cop is Ryo Saeba!

502
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,340
An accident on the road is a
good way to cover up a murder.

503
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,700
Only I get to kill Ryo!

504
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,010
Damn nuisance!

505
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,370
What's Umihotaru doing over here?

506
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,800
Oh... well.

507
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,680
Bye-bye!

508
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,120
Cheer up.

509
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,950
Kidnapper, my ass.

510
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,620
He's just a pervert.

511
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,570
Falcon's not back yet either.

512
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:55,500
The suspect has murdered two innocent
people, and is currently on the loose.

513
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,030
Ryo Saeba should be considered
armed and dangerous.

514
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,620
Ryo Saeba's motives
are still unknown.

515
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,100
What the hell is this?

516
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,090
This is all fake!

517
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:16,090
Well the part with the bra
and his butt is true...

518
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,200
...but the rest is SO fake!

519
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,290
Old man...

520
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,620
Could I get some more sake,
beef, chikua, and atsuage?

521
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,550
Sure.

522
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,850
Your mustache is coming off.

523
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,450
Oh damn!

524
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,540
As long as I wear this ring...

525
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,350
...they'll easily track us down.

526
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,950
That's right!

527
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,980
Let go of the gun.

528
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:11,880
Get the hell out of here.

529
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,130
Lucky!

530
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,040
All this food and sake for free!

531
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,460
Lucky! Lucky!

532
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,400
Not a shred of seriousness.

533
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,000
And now let me steal a
kiss and I'll be happy.

534
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,140
How about a drink instead?

535
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,280
Drink! Drink!

536
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,820
No, we can't.

537
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,590
Good morning, honey.

538
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,640
How about a good morning kiss?

539
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,040
Good morning.

540
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,340
How was the kiss?

541
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,040
Cold as steel.

542
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,270
Last night was magnificent.

543
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,710
Don't you remember?

544
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:44,910
Nope.

545
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,310
You danced all the way back here...

546
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,910
...and passed out.

547
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,950
So I didn't get any?

548
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,620
I guess we were lucky.

549
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,580
They didn't attack us
while you were out.

550
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,050
No place in this city is safe...

551
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,230
...as long as I wear this ring.

552
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,070
You're right.

553
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,000
And I'm getting tired of running.

554
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,160
Do you trust me?

555
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,990
Show me your ring.

556
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,380
You're free now.

557
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,430
You should leave the country
and take some time off.

558
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,940
Come with me.

559
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,840
I don't want to leave you.

560
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,900
I don't want to be alone.

561
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:13,810
I can't keep this act up forever.

562
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,330
You're awake.

563
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,020
Man, we were just
about to get it on.

564
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,180
You're lucky I didn't
kill you while you slept.

565
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,220
Killing you while you were drunk-off your
ass wouldn't do much for my pride.

566
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,880
So, you still want
to settle our rivalry?

567
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,690
Your next opponent is
not like any other.

568
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,420
Get on.

569
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,540
Ryo!

570
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,870
Don't worry.

571
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,350
The outcome of the battle is always decided by skill, energy and luck.

572
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,420
The goddess of luck
always smiles upon me.

573
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:07,870
And also...

574
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,510
I have this lucky lingerie.

575
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,530
We're going.

576
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:20,190
My job as your bodyguard is over.

577
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,030
Ryo, what about
your mokkori payment?

578
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,560
Oh shit, I forgot!

579
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,190
I'll be right there!

580
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,190
I'll be waiting in your room!

581
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,920
This won't take long!

582
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:35,990
I'll crush Umihotaru real quick
and come back to you!

583
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,400
Early this morning, the body of
a street vendor was found.

584
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:44,360
Ballistic tests have shown that
the suspect is the same person...

585
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,610
...as the one who murdered
the two men in the subway.

586
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:54,970
Ryo Saeba, the kidnapper of
newscaster, Sayaka Asagiri...

587
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,980
...is now a serious threat to
the safety of society.

588
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:04,210
This is such bullshit!
I can't take this anymore!

589
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,410
So, what are you gonna do?

590
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,120
I'm going to file a
protest at MegaCity TV!

591
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,710
At least wait until
Falcon comes back!

592
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,200
How's that sea firefly gonna help?

593
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,160
God, everyone's calling
him a sea firefly.

594
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,890
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

595
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,210
I just want to speak with
whoever's in charge here!

596
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,000
Hey!

597
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:43,080
That's why we're saying you
need an appointment to see him.

598
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,880
Appointment?

599
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,340
Yeah, sure I have an appointment.

600
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,730
There's no record of
such an appointment.

601
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,400
Is that so.

602
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,080
Then I'll tell you the truth.

603
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,730
The president here is already...

604
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,640
What about me?

605
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,270
President!

606
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,070
Let go of her.

607
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,960
Yes, sir.

608
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,860
I'm the president here, Jack Douglas.

609
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,340
You have something you would
like to discuss with me?

610
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,830
Uh...

611
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,100
If you'd like, we can speak
privately in my office.

612
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,400
Sure.

613
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,850
We're settling this today
once and for all.

614
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,320
When this hits the
ground, we face off.

615
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,780
Damn... not again.

616
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,380
I guess our rivarly will have
to wait, Umihotaru-chan.

617
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,030
That's Umibozu!

618
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,210
Wow!

619
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,950
Look at all these new
friends that wanna play.

620
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,450
Cops?

621
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,770
They're not real cops!

622
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:28,530
Ryo!

623
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,400
You'd better not get
your ass killed by them.

624
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,550
You either, Umihotaru.

625
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,770
That's Umibozu!

626
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:40,970
Get going.

627
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,430
Yeah yeah.

628
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,110
Don't get all worked up.

629
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,940
Sayaka Asagiri's kidnapper
and his accomplice...

630
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,620
...are waging an intense battle here.

631
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,440
Falcon!
...are waging an intense battle here.

632
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,220
Where the hell did
those cops come from?

633
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,670
I don't know. But they're
not real cops.

634
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,810
Anyway, I'll be there soon.

635
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,940
Me? Assassinated?

636
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,770
Sayaka Asagiri told you that?

637
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,170
Yes.

638
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:52,250
She also told us that your ring
has a poison needle in it.

639
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,040
In this?

640
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,760
Here, you can have it as a souvenir.

641
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,540
What's going on here?

642
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,150
She said that you were
assassinated by Mad Dog.

643
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,550
Anyway, what the hell is this
bullshit news you're airing?

644
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,290
It's all made up except
for the bra part.

645
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,870
Is this Mad Dog...

646
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,550
...the man behind you?

647
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,420
Huh?

648
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:32,930
He's my right-hand man...

649
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,220
Kaori Makimura.

650
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,630
I know everything about
you and City Hunter.

651
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,830
What a catch you are.

652
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:52,240
You're perfect bait
for the big one.

653
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,020
Looks like all the
scrubs are gone.

654
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,520
Oh, hell no!
That's not even funny!

655
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,970
No way!

656
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:52,700
I wonder if that
thing has missles.

657
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,130
Holy shit! They're
shooting missiles at us?

658
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,660
All right then...

659
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,320
You moron! You can't shoot a
missile down with a hand gun!

660
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,860
Sweet!

661
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,940
Bullseye!

662
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,530
I'm reporting live from the scene.
Nothing can be seen through the explosion.

663
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,720
There is no sight of the two mad men.

664
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,640
The suspect and his accomplice
are presumed dead.

665
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,490
But Sayaka Asagiri is nowhere in sight.
Where could she have been taken?

666
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,220
Her whereabouts still remain unknown.

667
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,810
Hey, you're awake!

668
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,060
Where am I?

669
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,100
Sayaka-san, where's Ryo?

670
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:22,250
Ryo?

671
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,820
Ryo! Weren't you two together?

672
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,760
I don't know any Ryo.

673
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,440
What do you mean
you don't know Ryo?

674
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,770
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

675
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,710
It's me, Kaori Makimura.

676
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,870
Aren't you Sayaka Asagiri?

677
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:43,750
I am indeed Sayaka Asagiri...

678
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,850
...but this is the first time we've met.

679
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,060
I don't know this Ryo
whom you're talking about.

680
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,040
Huh?

681
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,460
Goddammit!

682
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,810
What the hell is going on?

683
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,740
It's like there are
two Sayaka Asagiris!

684
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,270
Huh?

685
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:02,700
Two?

686
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:11,320
You're perfect bait for the big one.

687
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,070
The other Sayaka Asagiri is a fake!

688
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,880
So the real target is...

689
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,870
Ryo!

690
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,310
Can't breathe in there.

691
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,550
This is...

692
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:44,270
The Lord of the Sea Fireflies!

693
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,310
Rest in peace, Oh Mighty Lord.

694
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,180
Saeba-san, where's Falcon?

695
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,530
Right here.

696
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,380
Falcon!

697
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,860
God, what happened to you?

698
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,580
Wake up, Falcon.

699
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,400
Falcon!

700
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,210
Mi...Miki.

701
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,010
I'm so glad.

702
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,010
Saeba-san, Kaori's at MegaCity TV.

703
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,500
I see.

704
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,590
What are you waiting for?

705
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,050
You've gotta end this
one, once and for all.

706
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,870
End what?

707
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,580
But...

708
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,020
Just be careful.

709
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,690
Whenever women are
involved, you slack off.

710
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,220
I'm not gonna slack
off on this bitchass.

711
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,380
Not like the last time.

712
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,420
What is this?

713
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:49,040
All these guys are elite snipers.

714
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,470
What's the meaning behind all this?

715
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:54,620
Ryo...

716
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,110
Ryo...

717
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,410
I'll send you into MegaCity's garbage
chute at a hundred miles an hour.

718
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,390
This scent.

719
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,150
It's Saya-pii's!

720
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,080
I'm happy.

721
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:44,890
Where do you want to go today?

722
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,450
I want some cake and tea.

723
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,450
I found this great cafe yesterday.

724
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,620
Hey, hot babes, wanna get
it on with me tonight?

725
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,150
Nope.

726
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,760
Excuse me, where's the studio
for the Playboy programs?

727
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,160
Studio G.

728
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,710
What are you slacking
off for? Get moving.

729
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,270
Okay, I'll get back to work.

730
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,620
Ryo Saeba is here...

731
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,720
The target is heading
towards Studio G.

732
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,150
Everyone take your places.

733
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,930
So, where's this room located?

734
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,000
I have no idea.

735
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,080
Well, let's at least get out of here.

736
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,350
Excuse me?

737
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,470
Don't misunderstand.

738
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,800
My bra is custom-made.

739
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,290
If you light it, it explodes like boom!

740
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,520
A door like this won't stand a chance.

741
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,430
Wow!

742
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,930
So, how are we gonna light it?

743
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,130
No matches.

744
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,540
Or lighters.

745
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,290
Or flintstones.

746
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,170
In that case...

747
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,870
A hammer, eh?

748
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,810
Brute force is still the best way, huh?

749
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,570
Hey! Stop!

750
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:12,400
Stop immediately!

751
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,400
Oh man, they found me already!

752
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,120
Halt!

753
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,320
Chase him into Studio Y!

754
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,520
We've been waiting for
you, Ryo Saeba.

755
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

756
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,020
How long did you wait? An hour?

757
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:00,370
Two?

758
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,680
About thirty minutes.

759
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:14,050
Get him!

760
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,910
He's in the gap!

761
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:37,740
Lucky!

762
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:02,610
Where are the lights?

763
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,150
I don't care if they're the
emergency lights, put them on!

764
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:13,500
2

765
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,240
4

766
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:14,690
6

767
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,240
8

768
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:15,870
10

769
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,790
Goddammit!

770
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,790
I keep shooting but there
are just so many of them.

771
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,340
Such a waste of bullets.

772
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,820
Marvelous.

773
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,740
It's been a while, Ryo Saeba.

774
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,460
You don't seem surprised to see me.

775
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,390
I've known you were still around.

776
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,840
Even Umibozu knows.

777
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,920
I see.

778
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:10,150
You'll have to excuse me
about the mess down there.

779
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:16,150
I was just testing to see if
you still have all your skills.

780
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:20,990
All those men down
there are elite assassins.

781
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,190
So, I passed your test?

782
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:31,200
You are indeed the underworld's
number one man, Ryo Saeba.

783
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,120
I'm very happy.

784
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:37,840
I was worried that you
wouldn't make it this far.

785
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,700
But, if you couldn't get this far...

786
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,130
...then I would have no
business with you anyway.

787
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,210
Why did you go through
all this trouble?

788
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:51,740
Jack Knife?

789
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:56,970
Or should I address you as
the president of MegaCity TV...

790
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,780
...the media king, Jack Douglas?

791
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,660
I am Jack Knife right now.

792
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,820
I'm using my old name...

793
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,880
...to settle the score with you.

794
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,040
Back then...

795
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:37,960
We were going to settle which one
of us was the underworld's best.

796
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:44,370
The winner would also have
won the love of Sayuri.

797
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,420
Stop!

798
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:11,270
Ryo!

799
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,590
Jack!

800
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,970
Both of you...

801
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,060
I love you!

802
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,730
Ryo!

803
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,050
Jack!

804
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,100
Stop!

805
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:37,290
Ryo!

806
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,970
Please stop! Ryo!

807
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,840
Sayuri!

808
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:46,350
Don't die...

809
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,710
Sayuri!

810
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,290
Sayuri!

811
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,600
Don't die, Sayuri!

812
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:11,450
She threw herself in front of the bullet.
Everytime I think of how she must have felt...

813
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,160
...I am reminded of how much
we need to settle this.

814
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:22,040
I left my gun and became the media king.

815
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:28,030
And you stayed with the gun and
became the best in the underworld.


816
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,450
We should have never met again.

817
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:33,900
But...

818
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,420
Yes.

819
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,630
And I acquired everything
anyone would want.

820
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:39,530
Money.

821
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,080
Fame.

822
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:46,480
But there was still one thing
that I could not acquire.

823
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,280
To be Number One
in the underworld?

824
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,460
That's right.

825
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,760
If I don't beat you...

826
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,860
I can't be the best.

827
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:00,700
In my life, that's the only thing...

828
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,960
...I haven't accomplished.

829
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,000
Your voice is hoarse...

830
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,680
...and you're short of breath.

831
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:12,480
Heart disease?

832
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,950
Correct.

833
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,930
If I'm lucky, I have six months.

834
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,760
...and become the best.

835
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,790
For this...

836
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,330
You used Sayuri?

837
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,680
Ryo...

838
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,480
You knew all along?

839
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,100
You had cosmetic surgery
just to change your face?

840
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,630
So you could give Jack Knife
the only dream he had left?

841
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:10,270
When...

842
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,130
Did you know

843
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,740
When we first met.

844
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,290
And..

845
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,740
And?

846
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,810
...by the scent of your perfume.

847
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:25,020
It's just like Jack Knife's gun.
The Python, black to the grip...

848
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,240
...and covered with dark intentions.

849
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:30,960
You knew from the beginning?

850
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,910
Why'd you play along?

851
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,470
Even though you look different...

852
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,870
...I just wanted to be
with the woman I loved.

853
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:41,620
I'm pretty lame, huh?

854
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,840
Ryo.

855
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,560
Ryo Saeba...

856
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,440
Unfortunately, the one
Sayuri loves is me.

857
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,530
Like I said...

858
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,180
I acquired everything
anyone could dream of.

859
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,660
And she knew I would
face death for her.

860
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,160
She changed her appearance...

861
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,640
...and accepted the role of being
a lure to bring you to me.

862
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,530
Where's Kaori?

863
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,020
Don't worry.

864
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:21,100
She's with the real Sayaka Asagiri.

865
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:24,340
Even though you
knew my whole plot...

866
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:28,210
...you still face extreme
danger and came.

867
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:34,950
I guess that woman was a
better lure than I thought.

868
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:40,390
Kaori... is my partner

869
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,730
Take that you stupid door!

870
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,140
Wow!

871
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,790
Watch this.

872
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:59,090
I made this perfect drama.

873
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,260
And the final scene is...

874
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:05,310
...where you die...

875
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,460
...and I become the best.

876
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:13,700
The title is...

877
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,460
Ryo Saeba's Death.

878
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:19,360
The End of Ryo Saeba.

879
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:22,850
It's showtime.

880
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,380
A true death match.

881
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,380
Oh, man.

882
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,000
So, he can see me wherever I go?

883
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:52,550
This way!

884
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:54,040
Wait!

885
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,890
Nobody's here.

886
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:04,120
Good evening.

887
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,660
I'm Sayaka Asagiri from
MegaCity TV News.

888
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,100
This is?

889
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,370
MegaCity News' Studio Z.

890
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,140
I'm Sayaka Asagiri from
MegaCity TV News...

891
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,750
...bringing you today's news.

892
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,570
Ryo!

893
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,640
What's wrong, Ryo Saeba?

894
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,240
Are you going to
keep running forever?

895
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:42,800
Where you hide, I can see you
like you were out in the open.

896
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:52,300
Shinjuku?

897
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,550
It's a set.

898
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:55,320
Huh?

899
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:59,440
They made a set of
Shinjuku inside Studio Z.

900
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,570
Look, you can see behind the set.

901
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:03,800
This is a hunt.

902
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,800
Let's see who is the better
hunter between us.

903
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,250
So, they're inside Studio Z.

904
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,050
What's up, Jack?

905
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,200
I hope my hair looks good.

906
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,340
You look fine.

907
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,310
This is getting interesting.

908
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,680
It's been awhile...

909
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,980
...since I've felt such exhilaration.

910
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,850
You're such a cheater, Jack.

911
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:07,800
Shut up!

912
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:18,170
Go to the next studio, will you?

913
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,350
Holy shit! Plastic explosives?

914
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:30,560
Ryo!

915
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,140
Oh shit!

916
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,180
What the hell is this place?

917
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,190
I'm the real one ...the real one
...the real one ... the real one...

918
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:14,940
Damn, the explosions are drowning
out all the sounds he makes.

919
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,160
This place is...

920
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:16,990
Ryo!

921
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,750
It's just like ten years ago.

922
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,350
Your time is up.

923
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,760
Ryo Saeba.

924
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:24,280
Die, Ryo!

925
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,210
You are...

926
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,310
I'm not letting anyone
interfere with them.

927
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,290
Move out of the way.

928
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,230
No!

929
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,650
Ryo...

930
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,370
Ryo...

931
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:57,230
...fired...

932
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,340
...his gun at me!

933
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,560
What?

934
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,230
Damn, that lingerie WAS lucky.

935
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,660
My heart...

936
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,790
Not yet. Give me more time!

937
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,750
I can't keep this up
much longer either.

938
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,700
One shot left.

939
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:02,750
Ryo Saeba!

940
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,290
Let's finish this!

941
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:13,370
It's not another trap, is it?

942
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:17,610
It'll be a showdown...

943
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,530
...to see who's faster.

944
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,850
Just like back then.

945
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:26,410
Let's go!

946
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:54,900
No.

947
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:57,830
Ryo would never try to kill you.

948
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:02,300
I know that.

949
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,820
How would you know?

950
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,400
Because I'm his partner.

951
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:14,790
He may steal your bra, but he
would never shoot a woman.

952
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:16,120
Ryo...

953
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:18,120
Then...

954
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:19,400
...back then...

955
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:24,630
Wait!

956
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:29,640
Stop it!

957
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,260
Jack!

958
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,740
Ryo!

959
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,220
Jack!

960
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,940
Jack!

961
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,400
Why?

962
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,970
Ryo...

963
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,530
Back then...

964
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,540
You really...

965
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,270
...aimed for...

966
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:46,320
Thank you.

967
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:50,050
This is how it should have been.

968
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:51,960
I will...

969
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,570
...never...

970
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,820
for...get...

971
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:09,820
Ryo...

972
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:14,400
When she jumped in front of Jack,
you aimed for her pendant.

973
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,000
She wanted...

974
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:20,150
...to be certain of that.

975
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,470
What?

976
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,290
What's going on, Ryo?

977
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:39,350
My heart has probably
stopped by now.

978
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,170
Ryo Saeba.

979
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:44,790
The final scene is still to come.

980
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:46,950
Have fun.

981
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,830
Kaori! Run!

982
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:23,410
Hello, I am free announcer,
Sayaka Asagiri.

983
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:29,490
MegaCity TV, the station that broadcasted
fraudulent news, has disappeared.

984
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:31,220
I will repeat once more.

985
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:35,000
Hell, I am free announcer,
Sayaka Asagiri.

986
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,010
Wait, sexy nurses!

987
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,030
Let me give you my
eggroll injection!

988
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:44,940
Wait! Come back here, Ryo!

989
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:47,550
What's the matter with you?

990
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:51,010
You had a complete
transfusion of normal blood...

991
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:54,010
...but there's still perveted
blood in your system!

992
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,240
I think my blood got
worse than before!

993
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:59,610
I'm feeling all this
extra mokkori energy!
