2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,346
Thank you.

3
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,301
Hello? The Professor has just passed
through customs. Got it?

4
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,768
Roger.

5
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:26,486
Damn!

6
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,854
Damn, how did he do that?!
Damn!

7
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,946
Damn, how did he do that?!

8
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,425
Where did he go?

9
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:32,992
That way!
Where did he go?

10
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:33,927
That way!
Don't let him get away!

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,360
Don't let him get away!

12
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,132
Such persistent people!

13
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,344
I guess I need to finish them off.

14
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,312
That's my line!

15
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,158
You can't escape me any longer.

16
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,363
Ryo, darling!

17
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:10,630
Erica, dear...
Ryo, darling!

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,495
Erica, dear...

19
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,532
Somebody, help me!

20
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:26,006
We won't let you go any more. See?

21
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,681
Until you pay the bill, you can't
come to Kabuki-Cho at all.

22
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,557
I'll pay! I said I'll pay!

23
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:41,618
Don't even try to play dumb.
You can't trick us anymore.

24
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,193
You haven't paid in a long time.

25
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,367
You'll pay all the bills...

26
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,858
OR, you'll be ours!

27
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,209
I'm a man after all.

28
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,609
I'm gonna pay all of you with my body!

29
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,780
Wow, we did it!

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,247
Idiot.

31
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,207
If that's what you intend to do,

32
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,549
then I'm going to be the first one!

33
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,564

00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,406
I'm exhausted!

43
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:32,271
My legs are swollen.

44
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:39,304
Oh, a present for you? Black roses?
That's unusual.

45
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,413
Brother...

46
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:56,824
Now Appearing at
Shinjuki Kageki Dan Theater:
Emi Makaze

47
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:12,811
Ah, there it is! I found one!

48
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,321
Finally, I'll be able to pay the bills!

49
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,016
Kaori! Hey, Kao...

50
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:28,660
Miss Emi...

51
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:31,734
Your tastes run to that sort of thing?

52
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:37,040
Why didn't you say so? I can introduce
you to someone like that anytime!

53
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,044
You jerk! If you talk about Ms. Emi
like that ever again,

54
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:45,114
I'm gonna rip your mouth off then
sew it back on with string!

55
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,582
I'm just kidding.

56
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:46,749
Excuse me...
I'm just kidding.

57
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:48,046
Excuse me...

58
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,521
Are you City Hunter?

59
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:03,533
Ryo! Hey, Ryo!

60
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:10,039
Hurry up and go away. I don't take
requests from men or transvestites.

61
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,031
You jerk!

62
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,318
Please, let us help you.

63
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:26,448
Even if we have to cancel other clients,
we'll take care of you.

64
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,959
Thank you.

65
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,056
You're looking for your older brother
who has been missing?

66
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:44,502
Yes, he disappeared thirteen
years ago when I was nine.

67
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:49,445
But I received a bunch of
flowers this morning.

68
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:52,849
Are you sure they are really
from your older brother?

69
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:58,788
Yes, I have been chosen for the
lead in the next performance,

70
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:03,092
and I really want him to
see me in the play.

71
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:05,695
What a beautiful story about an older
brother and a younger sister.

72
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:08,464
However, it's the police's job to
look for missing people.

73
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:09,232
Ryo!

74
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:09,966
What should I do to be
accepted by you?
Ryo!

75
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,024
What should I do to be
accepted by you?

76
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:17,807
It's easy. I want you to prove that
you are a normal female.

77
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,798
What do you mean by that?

78
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,944
Well, it means...

79
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:24,614
THIS!

80
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:27,383
What incredible boobs, so contrary
to my expectations!

81
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:32,184
You! What are you doing to Ms. Emi?!

82
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:43,766
You see, she has another crazy fan.

83
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,368
Umibouzu too?

84
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:47,165
Oh?

85
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:55,178
Listen! Don't you dare refuse
Ms. Emi's request!

86
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:58,014
Or I'm going to make sure you can
never have an erection again!

87
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:00,209
What? You're kidding!

88
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,111
Well, you are always welcome
to be my client.

89
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,493
Thank you.

90
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,796
City Hunter and Falcon...

91
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:31,506
Do you have any information
about your older brother?

92
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,888
He got rid of everything when
he left the house.

93
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,355
How about some pictures?

94
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,319
Only one. I have a family picture.
It's in my room at the dormitory.

95
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:52,926
Dormitory? A women's dormitory?
A flower bed of women...

96
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:55,295
Mr. Saeba...

97
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:59,200
That means... That means...

98
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,378
Lots of girls, and I'm gonna do
some serious SCORING!

99
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,886
My sexual energy is already
starting to build!

100
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:15,515
Your pure affection for your lost brother
has started a fire in my heart.

101
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,859
You'll say anything in order to get in a
women's dormitory, Won't you?

102
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,562
You already know what the price will be
if you do something wrong, don't you?

103
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:25,767
C'mon, just this once, let me get some...

104
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:35,002
I understand. I promise I'll really
help you, cross my heart.

105
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,550
Shinjuku Kageki Dan Dormitory

106
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:57,364
Wow, the scent of the flower bed,
tempting the woody...

107
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,207
What did you do to me?

108
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,642
You're staying here.

109
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:06,809
What? How come?
You're staying here.

110
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,210
What? How come?

111
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,973
Men aren't allowed in this place.

112
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,581
Be good and stay here.

113
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:13,349
Yes...

114
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:14,083
Let's go, Ms. Emi.
Yes...

115
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:14,811
Let's go, Ms. Emi.

116
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:17,286
But isn't that a little much
to do to Mr. Saeba?

117
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:22,280
Don't feel sorry for him. Even
that might not be enough.

118
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,293
So cruel!

119
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:38,007
Hey, look. What's that?

120
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,508
Shall we feed him or something?

121
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,499
Hi!

122
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:44,502
Oh no, he's waving at us.

123
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:16,507
This is the only picture
of my whole family.

124
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:19,011
This one's my older brother.

125
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:23,318
Ryo!

126
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,395
Are you all right?

127
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:32,561
Mr. Saeba?
Are you all right?

128
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,028
Mr. Saeba?

129
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,334
You jerk! You wanna fight?

130
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:41,092
Wait!

131
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,238
Look...

132
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,041
My picture!

133
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,044
My brother's face!

134
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:08,097
It's a Black Talon, isn't it?

135
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:09,564
What's that?

136
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:12,768
The bullet with a past, taken
out of production

137
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:16,272
because it had too much
destructive power.

138
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,107
This was in Ms. Emi's room?

139
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,268
Yes, I dug it out of the wall.

140
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:24,270
Does she have any idea why?

141
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:28,850
Where is Kaori now?

142
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,182
She said she was going to guard Emi
just in case of an emergency.

143
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:35,791
She stole my job!

144
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,661
It's better than you guarding her.

145
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:39,662
What did you say?!

146
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:40,162
What's wrong?!
What did you say?!

147
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:41,129
What's wrong?!

148
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,237
A Black Talon, isn't it?

149
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:48,637
Saeko!
A Black Talon, isn't it?

150
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:49,872
Saeko!

151
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:53,273
I guess we're going to be a team.

152
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:56,004
Who would want to be on
a team with you?!

153
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,445
Codename: Professor. You've
heard of him, haven't you?

154
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,320
People say that he's Japanese
or related to a Japanese.

155
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,155
The only thing I know about him is that
he was once in the Foreign Legion.

156
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,328
The Foreign Legion?

157
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,830
It's unconfirmed, but probably.

158
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,201
If he used to be Foreign Legion, his
past was erased when he joined.

159
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:22,972
More than ten assassinations are
thought to have been his work.

160
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:26,842
Also, the kidnapping of an executive
of the European economic world,

161
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:30,446
and robbery of a Swiss International
Bank transport truck are near certain.

162
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:35,042
And innumerable other crimes which
were probably committed by him.

163
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:40,289
None of these have been
solved, have they?

164
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,092
That's right. He's not in it for money.

165
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:46,195
He only commits crimes that please
his sense of aesthetics.

166
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:48,493
That's why he is called the Professor.

167
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:50,533
What a snob!

168
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:55,163
The Professor usually uses this
bullet, the Black Talon.

169
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,973
Is he in Japan?

170
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:04,037
Yes, we got a tip from Interpol and
were watching Narita Airport, but...

171
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:09,182
After these stories, it's hard to imagine
how he and Ms. Emi could be related.

172
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,914
Kouichi Tatsuoka and Satoru Yamauchi
are to be transferred under your
control.

173
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,354
Yes, Sir.

174
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,726
Are you all right?

175
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:55,695
It's nothing, I've had an upset
stomach since this morning.

176
00:15:56,265 --> 00:16:00,224
Take care. Well, I leave these
two suspects to you.

177
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:02,070
Yes, Sir.

178
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,912
We're going the wrong way, aren't we?

179
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,678
Is it time to take a leak?

180
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:45,647
I don't like people using
vulgar language.

181
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,150
What the hell?

182
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,152
Please, please help me!

183
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:50,819
I'm going to be incinerated!

184
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:51,654
Please hurry up and take this off of me!
I'm going to be incinerated!

185
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:54,623
Please hurry up and take this off of me!

186
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,694
C4? Plastic explosive, isn't it?

187
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:00,389
As I might expect from you,
Mr. Yamauchi.

188
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,927
Who the hell are you?!

189
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,902
I have to tell you this much.

190
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:13,799
That is the last time you'll be able to talk
to me that way, Mr. Tatsuoka.

191
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:18,540
Interesting. Prove it!

192
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:28,582
I've heard that you killed five people
without any weapons.

193
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,628
But you waste a lot of movement.

194
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,095
You...

195
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:51,340
Over the edge!

196
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:07,262
Will you explain why you
did this for us?

197
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:11,926
The two of you work for me now.

198
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,306
The Professor hijacked the transfer van?

199
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,371
We don't know why.

200
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:31,787
Satoru Yamauchi: A mad bomber, who
turned his hobby into actual profit.

201
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:38,460
One of the best in the world at
contriving bombs. The other one...

202
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,962
Tatsuoka, isn't it?

203
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:42,431
Yes, he killed four people
during a bank robbery

204
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:45,491
and a policeman who tried
to capture him.

205
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:50,498
Don't you think it's strange? The
shooting incident and now this?

206
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,041
I can't read the Professor's actions.

207
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,211
A man like him doesn't waste movement.

208
00:18:56,211 --> 00:19:02,384
There's got to be a reason for all of
this, including returning to Japan.

209
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:08,323
If he really intended to shoot her,
she and I wouldn't be here.

210
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:09,915
You mean he missed on purpose?

211
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,368
This man.

212
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,675
Have you seen him before?

213
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:27,176
No...

214
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:28,177
Of course not.
No...

215
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:28,477
Of course not.

216
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:33,039
There's no way that Ms. Emi has any
connection with a jerk like that.

217
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:36,552
Ryo doesn't seem to agree with you.

218
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:41,319
Whatever he says, he just wants to
be close to Ms. Emi, that's all.

219
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:45,093
By the way, where is he?

220
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:48,430
He's waiting outside, because this
place is for women only.

221
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,897
There's no way!

222
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,934
You're right! It can't be happening,
because it's Ryo!

223
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:58,128
He's such a jerk!

224
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:29,493
An earthquake?

225
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:35,506
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Please continue your lesson.

226
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:44,953
Stay here and watch!

227
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,056
What am I supposed to do if the
Professor shows up?!

228
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:50,286
You can bark or bite him.

229
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,407
Your parents have already passed away?

230
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:10,310
They were looking forward to seeing me
on stage, but five years ago...

231
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:18,209
That's why I really want my brother
to see me on stage, but...

232
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,454
But?

233
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,757
No, it's nothing.

234
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:27,255
I understand how you feel.

235
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:31,198
I lost my parents too.

236
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,033
Kaori...

237
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:38,231
I understand your wanting to perform
on stage for your brother.

238
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,667
We can be friends, can't we?

239
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:55,416
We're safe while we can hear
the dogs howling like that.

240
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:01,129
Kaori?

241
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,565
Yes, how can I help you?

242
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,590
This bath is not very big, but do
you want to join me?

243
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,196
No, thank you very much!

244
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:35,457
I can't believe I didn't realize what
a glamorous cutie she is.

245
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,873
Brother...

246
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:53,004
There's a long story behind you
and your brother, isn't there?

247
00:22:54,783 --> 00:23:02,524
I'm a honeybee with a feeble mind
drawn here by your sweet scent.

248
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,584
I came to deliver your pollen of love!

249
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:12,091
Kaori!

250
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:17,239
What the hell? Who the
hell is a honeybee?!

251
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,542
You jerk, idiot, trash!

252
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:24,034
You're just a vulgar bumblebee!

253
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,699
I guess Kaori can take
good care of her.

254
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:54,802
Did you come all the way here just to
make sarcastic remarks like that?

255
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:01,173
I have an old friend in
the Foreign Legion.

256
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:05,383
This is some information he sent me.

257
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:10,292
The Professor used to belong to the
2nd Parachute Regiment.

258
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:13,161
He was an elite soldier then.

259
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,722
However, what he saw there was hell.

260
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:19,099
What do you mean?

261
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:24,398
His regiment was sent to the front
line during the Gulf War.

262
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:32,714
His platoon went to reconnoiter the
enemy, and became isolated.

263
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:42,624
The multinational force which was
supposed to be on his side

264
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:46,082
sent shells instead of a rescue team.


265
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:52,431
Of course, everyone thought
he was dead.

266
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,836
But...

267
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:01,272
He was alive.

268
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:20,784
He crept into the multinational force
HQ and killed the commander.

269
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,425
No one has seen him since.

270
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,649
One more thing. He was very
eager to erase his past.

271
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:43,049
His past...

272
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:48,146
What the hell was he thinking,
calling himself a honeybee?

273
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,863
No! No, no, cut!

274
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:09,839
What are you doing, Makaze?

275
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,179
I'm sorry.

276
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:11,780
What's happened to you? You aren't
concentrating at all! Not at all!
I'm sorry.

277
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,951
What's happened to you? You aren't
concentrating at all! Not at all!

278
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:16,985
Yes, Sir!

279
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:17,452
I've had enough!
Yes, Sir!

280
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,441
I've had enough!

281
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:23,558
In this condition, you will only
bring the others down.

282
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:25,458
Go somewhere and start over
again by yourself.

283
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:28,821
Yes, Sir. I'm sorry.

284
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,200
Ms. Emi!

285
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:48,016
Don't!

286
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:48,550
But...
Don't!

287
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,482
But...

288
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:53,876
She's a pro. She'll have to solve
the problem by herself.

289
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:34,394
Mr. Saeba...

290
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:35,401
Morning!

291
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:35,934
Good morning.
Morning!

292
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:36,235
Good morning.

293
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:36,902
Good morning.
Where did you go after that?

294
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:39,666
Where did you go after that?

295
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,105
Is this for me?

296
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:47,711
Yes, a delivery man brought this for you
a little while ago, Ms. Makaze.

297
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,513
10:00 PM
Yomeriri Land

298
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:59,380
Good morning, everybody.
It's me, Oogami!

299
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:02,758
No, no! No way!

300
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:06,758
But black roses have a special meaning
for me and my brother!

301
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:08,934
I'm positive they are from him.

302
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:13,735
You may think so, but it might be a trap
set by the Professor. Right, Ryo?

303
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:19,410
Hey, Ryo!

304
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,210
Oh, I don't really care.

305
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:27,748
You're such a...

306
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:32,448
Even if you hate me, I don't care.
There's absolutely no way!

307
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:47,897
Here's your bathrobe.

308
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:11,862
Mr. Saeba!

309
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,768
Do you want to see your brother?

310
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,679
The last time I saw my brother
was thirteen years ago.

311
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,943
Well, what kind of person
was your brother?

312
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,046
Well, he was a good brother to me.

313
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,891
Recollections are like mirages.

314
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:41,189
So even though you see them, you're
never really able to grab them.

315
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:43,896
I shouldn't see him, should I?

316
00:29:43,896 --> 00:29:45,454
It's all up to you.

317
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,004
This doesn't feel like a good place to
meet your brother after a long time.

318
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:21,667
I knew you would come with her,
City Hunter.

319
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:25,170
It's been thirteen years since
I've seen you, Emi.

320
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,637
Brother?!

321
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:33,569
The man who was your older brother
died on a battlefield in the desert.

322
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:41,011
He was reborn to take revenge on the
God who sent him into the world,

323
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:47,092
and to take revenge on that world.

324
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:50,425
Do you believe even your sister is an
obstacle to erasing your past?

325
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:55,801
Fortunately, I don't have
any blood relatives.

326
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:58,167
I have no biological relation to her.

327
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,608
There's one more thing.

328
00:31:02,608 --> 00:31:05,805
Ryo Saeba, you are the reason
for my return to Japan.

329
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:10,749
I heard your name in the Foreign Legion
and European underground.

330
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:18,087
A legendary hero, and the number one
man in the underground: City Hunter.

331
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:22,260
I have been looking forward
to seeing you fight.

332
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,762
I see.

333
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:27,027
Stop! Please stop!

334
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:32,767
Today, I just came to say hello.

335
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,238
Look at that.

336
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,088
What the hell did you do?

337
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,558
It's almost time for a fast train
that runs through there.

338
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:56,118
I guess I'll wait and see what
you're going to do about it.

339
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,729
Mr. Saeba!

340
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,093
He's wasting time.

341
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:10,729
Good job, City Hunter.
You're so exciting!

342
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,843
Mr. Saeba!

343
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:41,231
City Hunter, this is my message for you
and for the Japanese government!

344
00:33:56,615 --> 00:33:59,914
Oh, it was so close.

345
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,921
If it had stopped a second later, there
would have been hundreds dead.

346
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:10,918
As my brother said, I don't have any
biological relationship to him.

347
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,531
Or my parents either.

348
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:20,267
My real parents died when
I was five years old.

349
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:25,644
The couple who took me out of the
orphanage and raised me were...

350
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:29,603
The Professor's, well, Muto's
parents, right?

351
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:37,619
They treated me as if I were their
real daughter, better, really.

352
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:04,515
Yes?

353
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:16,857
That's the first time I saw my brother.

354
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:23,995
He received a distinguished degree from
Harvard when he was sixteen.

355
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:26,728
But...

356
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:31,605
He never opened his heart to
either me or his parents.

357
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:35,873
Then on that night...

358
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:39,081
The night he turned eighteen...

359
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,902
Right, this is good. Emi, tell your
brother everything's ready.

360
00:35:56,902 --> 00:35:58,369
Sure!

361
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:15,911
Brother, it's ready!

362
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,289
Brother?

363
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:28,028
My brother suddenly disappeared.

364
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:38,944
Born to a rich family, an advanced
degree even though he was young...

365
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:43,745
Even if you have everything, it doesn't
guarantee happiness.

366
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:48,919
The Professor?!

367
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:54,459
You jerk! You exposed
Ms. Emi to danger!

368
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,926
Stop, Kaori!

369
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,228
It's all my fault.

370
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,792
It's all my fault for causing
a problem like this.

371
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:04,501
Then...

372
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:07,504
Kaori...

373
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:19,317
As you can see,

374
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:24,155
the railroad bridge was ravaged and
twisted into this cruel shape.

375
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:26,024
A statement issued by the Tokyo Metro
Police names the suspect

376
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:31,062
as the same one who kidnapped two
inmates during a prison transfer.

377
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:33,665
The suspect goes by the code
name of "Professor."

378
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:38,728
The Police are engaged in a special
search and ask that people be aware.

379
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:58,584
Is this Tokyo?

380
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:07,824
Here is Shinjuku, City Hunter's garden,
the most vulgar of places.

381
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,828
However, three days from
now it will disappear.

382
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:22,475
It's done. My masterpiece is complete.

383
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:33,992
The Chief of the Metropolitan
Police, please.

384
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:35,459
Professor?!

385
00:38:37,429 --> 00:38:39,364
Here is my request.

386
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:43,061
Request? Stop fooling around,
you bastard!

387
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:47,605
Chief, you talk too much and waste my
time. It proves you're brainless.

388
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,072
Let me talk to somebody else.

389
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:54,210
Damn you! Saeko?

390
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:57,476
What are your demands?

391
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,419
I met you at the airport.

392
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:03,888
Nogami, Police Inspector Saeko Nogami.

393
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:07,792
Nogami? Are you related to the Chief?

394
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:11,193
You talk too much too.

395
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:16,296
I would like you to be the contact
person for my negotiations.

396
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:21,606
Well, this is what I would like:
Gather ten billion yen.

397
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:22,941
Ten billion?

398
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:23,108
What?
Ten billion?

399
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:24,542
What?

400
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:27,011
I will let you know how you can
deliver it to me later.

401
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:28,513
If my request is denied,

402
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:33,974
a devastating accident will happen
somewhere in Tokyo.

403
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,850
Ten billion? He doesn't think small.

404
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:41,918
As you can guess, the government
doesn't intend to pay him at all.

405
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,084
So I need a favor from you.

406
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,235
I don't want to hear it.
I'm too busy guarding Emi.

407
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:52,203
I can't change the order
of my priorities.

408
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:55,206
In short, you want sex, don't you?

409
00:39:55,206 --> 00:40:01,546
Exactly! You don't pay me back, so
getting it on with Emi is first priority!

410
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:03,013
Oh, Ryo!

411
00:40:12,991 --> 00:40:18,691
The Professor? You're dealing with
an incredible man, Ryo.

412
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:29,474
That's one way to stay calm
and composed.

413
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:32,739
Kaori won't let me watch tapes
like this at home.

414
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:36,548
Then what do you want me to do?

415
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:41,085
I want you to use your network to
find out where he is, Gen.

416
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:46,124
Well, I will do my best, but it
won't be easy at all.

417
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:50,185
If it were easy to find out, I wouldn't
ask you to help, Gen.

418
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:54,199
I understand.

419
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:57,293
One thing, Ryo. I've been meaning
to tell you for a long time.

420
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:00,663
What is it, Gen? Don't
hesitate to tell me.

421
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:04,808
Stop taking the X-rated videos
out of my shop.

422
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:11,049
Shinjuku Kageki Dan Theater

423
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:13,313
Shinjuku Kageki Dan Theater
What? No, you can't do that.

424
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:24,095
In this situation, I think you don't need
to worry about the event.

425
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:25,597
I don't agree.

426
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:27,966
Ryo, please say something to stop her.

427
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:29,433
The one on the poster?

428
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:35,701
Given the circumstances, I think she
ought to cancel the event.

429
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:40,945
I'm scheduled to ride a new
train with my fans,

430
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,947
so don't even think about stopping me.

431
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:45,016
Wait a second!

432
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:47,185
If you are so worried about
letting her go,

433
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:49,687
Why don't you go and guard her?

434
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:52,121
You're the only person
who can protect her!

435
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:54,926
I guess so.

436
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:57,451
Right! Then take care of the bill.

437
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,777
Do you intend to be a decoy?

438
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:16,907
It's the only thing I can do.

439
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:21,547
I don't know whether I will be able
to stop my brother or not.

440
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:24,448
Stopping him means...

441
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:26,621
I know.

442
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:34,864
I've always deceived the
people around me.

443
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:43,938
In the orphanage, I was good at reading
what adults were thinking.

444
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:49,811
I knew that they liked me more when
I pretended to be cheerful.

445
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:54,049
When I was adopted, I did my best
to be liked by them.

446
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:02,057
Honestly, the more tenderly they treated
me, the more depressed I became.

447
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,124
During that time...

448
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,407
Surprise!

449
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:04,354
What are you thinking about?

450
00:44:09,193 --> 00:44:13,789
But just thinking about something
brings no power.

451
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,101
Right?

452
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:27,303
Don't you sometimes think that the
person here is not really you?

453
00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:32,282
Brother?

454
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,751
Ah, well...

455
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:52,937
At that very second, I realized it!

456
00:44:52,937 --> 00:44:55,565
I discovered that my brother's character
is very similar to mine.

457
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:00,778
We seem extremely different,

458
00:45:00,778 --> 00:45:03,906
but I knew he couldn't believe in anyone
but himself, just like me!

459
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:09,342
I'm sorry. What I'm telling you must
be very depressing, Mr. Saeba.

460
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:20,530
If you need to kill my brother...

461
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:27,100
It's time...

462
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:34,210
I don't want to hate him any more.

463
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:43,271
New Train!
Special Presentation with Emi Makaze
of Shinjuku Kageki Dan at 3:00

464
00:45:44,178 --> 00:45:45,479
There, that's her!

465
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:45,679
It is! She's really coming!
There, that's her!

466
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,204
It is! She's really coming!

467
00:45:51,419 --> 00:45:52,886
Hello.

468
00:45:54,388 --> 00:45:56,190
It's the Professor, isn't it?

469
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,992
Are you going to pay me now?

470
00:45:57,992 --> 00:45:59,927
I'm sorry, but...

471
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:03,264
The result is exactly what I expected.

472
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:04,832
You know when to give up.

473
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:09,565
No, your side is the one
that will give up.

474
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:14,037
If you refuse, Shinjuku will
disappear from the map.

475
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:17,535
Wait! What do you mean?

476
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,551
Hey, Baby!

477
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:23,951
What a cute babe! You are lucky, Man!
Hey, Baby!

478
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,442
What a cute babe! You are lucky, man!

479
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,322
What? What's going on?

480
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:28,489
I've heard that We're going to help Ryo.
What? What's going on?

481
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:31,358
I've heard that we're going to help Ryo.

482
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,953
Hey, hey, be quiet.

483
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:38,894
I understand. You can
leave things to us.

484
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:45,406
We know more about the Shinjuku
underground than the Police do.

485
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:46,873
Everything!

486
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:52,476
Thanks, but if you find something
suspicious, don't touch it.

487
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:55,441
I understand.

488
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:05,558
Okay, let's go.

489
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:20,274
We are too busy and don't have time
to deal with things like this.

490
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:22,071
Hurry up and clean it up!

491
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:37,525
What happened?

492
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:37,858
A terrorist bomb, I heard.
What happened?

493
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:38,984
A terrorist bomb, I heard.

494
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,861
Oh, I saw something on TV.

495
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,988
Yeah, the Professor? That was his name!

496
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:52,138
Hello, this is Nogami.

497
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:55,001
Professor?

498
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:58,241
Did you receive my message?

499
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,805
Loud and clear.

500
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:06,554
Similar devices are set in about a
hundred places in Shinjuku,

501
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:09,785
but you'd better not even think
about disarming them.

502
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:14,562
As security for us, if someone
tampers with them,

503
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:17,531
the triggering device will go
off automatically.

504
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:21,197
You have three hours left.

505
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:25,306
Then, an explosion will happen which
will trigger the other devices.

506
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:27,035
All of the remaining devices will
explode at the same time.

507
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:33,514
So, I'm going to give you one hour
to think about what to do.

508
00:48:33,514 --> 00:48:35,482
Hurry up and make up your mind.

509
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,887
Ryo!

510
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:50,097
Everything is normal.

511
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:51,564
Thank you.

512
00:48:54,602 --> 00:48:56,170
Wow, Ms. Emi, please look at me!

513
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,605
STATIONMASTER FOR A DAY
Wow, Ms. Emi, please look at me!

514
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:59,038
STATIONMASTER FOR A DAY

515
00:49:17,758 --> 00:49:22,129
As of this moment, we've found
fifty-seven devices.

516
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:24,097
If all of those explode...

517
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:28,761
Shinjuku will be completely ruined.

518
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:32,965
Next to the Batting Center? Thanks.

519
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:37,603
Now we've found ninety-seven.

520
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:39,412
Ryo!

521
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:45,084
I found one. There's a van parked in
front of the Hotel Nekomanma.

522
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:47,253
Ninety-eight...

523
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:49,222
Hey, hey, Ryo.

524
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,118
Give me a reward!

525
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:00,266
You bastard!

526
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:06,630
Oh, Umi honey, it was
just a tiny mistake.

527
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:08,975
Don't be ridiculous!

528
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:13,079
Violence is not a good thing.

529
00:50:16,817 --> 00:50:21,151
It's not a good thing.

530
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:37,404
The most outstanding feature of this
new vehicle is its safety system.

531
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:42,142
The computer manages everything
including maintenance,

532
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:44,110
sudden stops and the like.

533
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:47,281
Are you really sure that this
vehicle is safe? Really?

534
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:48,976
I guarantee you.

535
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:54,886
This vehicle will perform absolutely
safely, with or without Ms. Makaze.

536
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:03,189
I see, that's it.

537
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,066
The locations of the bombs!

538
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:10,137
The bombs are placed in a circular path
leading from Shinjuku Station.

539
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:11,839
That means...

540
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,967
Yes, he said the explosion's
trigger device was...

541
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:23,278
What the hell?! The new
Yamate Line train?

542
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,018
It's the only answer we've been
able to come up with.

543
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:31,589
Current
Speed

544
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:38,197
Wow, Ms. Emi!

545
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:42,228
Please don't push!

546
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:53,110
Chief, the bomb squad was dispatched
a little while ago.

547
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,088
The Professor, isn't it?

548
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:05,793
You've guessed it.

549
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:09,786
Let me warn you, don't even think
about stopping the train.

550
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:14,234
If the speed of the train goes
under 60 kilometers,

551
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,202
the trigger device will
automatically detonate.

552
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,472
One more thing.

553
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:22,670
If the weight in the engineer's seat
changes, it will have the same result.

554
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,078
She's your sister!

555
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:26,545
You're wasting time.

556
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,951
You linked all the bombs set in
Shinjuku with it, didn't you?

557
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:32,976
City Hunter! You're right.

558
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,090
Yes, the bombs are connected to the
triggering device by remote control.

559
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,494
You have about two hours left.

560
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:46,399
The amount of time it takes the Yamate
Line to complete its route twice.

561
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:54,908
When the train arrives at Shinjuku
Station for the second time,

562
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:57,077
the triggering device will detonate.

563
00:52:57,077 --> 00:53:02,709
What? You mean the bomb
is set in this seat?!

564
00:53:14,161 --> 00:53:17,331
Pull yourself together! You can't panic!

565
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:19,600
Didn't you say you would protect her?

566
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,000
You said you would die if need be
to protect her, didn't you?

567
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:26,967
Yes, sure. We'll be fine.

568
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:29,241
I should say, I will save you.

569
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:41,343
Don't! If the train stops, it will
explode! Didn't you hear?!

570
00:53:42,022 --> 00:53:43,457
No!

571
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:43,624
No! I don't want to die!
No!

572
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:46,092
No! I don't want to die!

573
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:54,263
I'm getting on the train now!

574
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:02,475
Gotcha!

575
00:54:20,193 --> 00:54:22,093
I picked off a fly.

576
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,055
Shot down?

577
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:31,033
There are more than three hundred
people on that train!

578
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:35,742
I'm going to talk to the Prime Minister.

579
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:45,315
I'm going to tell you again.
Don't waste time.

580
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:48,578
The only thing that does is increase
the number of victims.

581
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:49,856
The Diet Building

582
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:52,916
I request of the Japanese government:

583
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:53,794
The Bank of Japan

584
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:57,093
The Bank of Japan
Ten billion in used 10,000 yen bills.

585
00:54:58,098 --> 00:55:02,057
Put each ten million yen in
a sealed plastic bag.

586
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,266
And wait for my next instructions.

587
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:13,205
I request this of the Japanese
government again.

588
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,059
Police are being sent to each
major train station

589
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:28,027
with the cooperation of the
Self Defense Force.

590
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:31,999
Chief, even in the worst case, stop
the destruction of Shinjuku.

591
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:35,127
I know! I know that!

592
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:37,437
I have an idea.

593
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:42,132
The train is inside the loop near
Akihabara Station.

594
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:45,712
As it travels between Oosaki
and Shinagawa,

595
00:55:45,712 --> 00:55:50,450
We can switch the track, sending
it into the Shinagawa Depot.

596
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:53,385
But if we do so, the passengers
on the train would be...

597
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,621
It prevents the Shinjuku area
from being ruined.

598
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:00,761
It's ridiculous! Why don't
we just pay him?

599
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:02,763
He's a cold-hearted terrorist.

600
00:56:02,763 --> 00:56:06,494
Even if we pay him, I don't think he'll
stop the bombs from exploding.

601
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,047
What's your idea?

602
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:20,547
I don't have time to explain to you.
What's your idea?

603
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:22,208
I don't have time to explain to you.

604
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:24,707
Hey, stop! I said STOP!

605
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:59,583
Kaori, I can't take this any longer!

606
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:03,523
Be patient, please.

607
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:03,990
I can't be patient any longer!
Be patient, please.

608
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,015
I can't be patient any longer!

609
00:57:07,394 --> 00:57:12,263
Just a little longer. Ryo will come
and rescue us. I know it!

610
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:21,365
Ryo! Umibouzu too!

611
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:24,811
Don't make any mistakes! If we hit it,
we're going to die!

612
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:27,371
I know that! Shut up and get ready!

613
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,777
A little slower!

614
00:57:35,322 --> 00:57:36,823
You idiot!

615
00:57:36,823 --> 00:57:38,984
Damn, too slow!

616
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:42,729
You bastard!

617
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:42,896
Hurry up and jump!
You bastard!

618
00:57:42,896 --> 00:57:44,955
Hurry up and jump!

619
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,336
Ryo...

620
00:57:54,574 --> 00:57:56,474
Ms. Emi, get down!

621
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:05,418
Umibouzu!

622
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:06,885
Right!

623
00:58:16,863 --> 00:58:18,330
Ryo!

624
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,807
Kaori?

625
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,975
That idiot.

626
00:58:51,064 --> 00:58:52,098
What?

627
00:58:52,098 --> 00:58:52,566
Hey, Kaori!
What?

628
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:53,897
Hey, Kaori!

629
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:03,510
You jerk! I thought you had died!

630
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,671
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! The BOMB!

631
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:31,504
What shall we do?

632
00:59:31,504 --> 00:59:31,671
Let's wait and see what
he's going to do.
What shall we do?

633
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:33,935
Let's wait and see what
he's going to do.

634
00:59:37,978 --> 00:59:39,980
Can't you disarm it somehow?

635
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,847
I don't think it can be disarmed, except
by the person who made it.

636
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:47,854
But there's no way to bring him here!

637
00:59:47,854 --> 00:59:50,924
Please go. Kaori, please save yourself.

638
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,426
I can't do that!

639
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:54,893
I'm fine.

640
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:03,136
Just by looking at your sexy body, I'd
guess you weigh about 44 kg, right?

641
01:00:03,136 --> 01:00:04,237
Yes...

642
01:00:04,237 --> 01:00:04,638
Bingo!
Yes...

643
01:00:04,638 --> 01:00:05,972
Bingo!

644
01:00:05,972 --> 01:00:07,974
What the hell are you thinking
in a situation like this?!

645
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,566
What about yours, Kaori?

646
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:12,006
Weight! Your weight!

647
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:14,347
45kg...

648
01:00:14,347 --> 01:00:16,650
Don't be vain in a situation like this.

649
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,208
47kg...

650
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,083
A 3kg difference.

651
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:26,452
I say we take a chance on how
sensitive the bomb is.

652
01:00:26,893 --> 01:00:28,929
No! No way!

653
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:32,057
You can't survive any longer, either
physically or mentally.

654
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:36,792
I can't! I can't save myself by
using Kaori as my substitute.

655
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,940
Don't worry.

656
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:43,208
I trust him.

657
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:51,316
Kaori...

658
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:57,512
You are hiding something
important, aren't you?

659
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:04,186
If you're carrying things like this, I'm
sure the bomb will explode!

660
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:10,870
And this one, this, this, there,
and this one, your favorite!

661
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,839
Any more?

662
01:01:14,374 --> 01:01:16,501
You carry this many?

663
01:01:20,714 --> 01:01:22,341
Make sure the timing is right!

664
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:25,785
Good, let's start!

665
01:01:25,785 --> 01:01:26,753
One...

666
01:01:26,753 --> 01:01:27,754
Two...

667
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:29,221
Three!

668
01:01:38,098 --> 01:01:41,192
I guess the difference in weight was
within the permissible limit.

669
01:01:41,768 --> 01:01:43,531
What?

670
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:48,808
Now, it's my turn! I can do
whatever I want to!

671
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:53,273
You jerk!

672
01:01:55,415 --> 01:02:00,284
Without these things, you're nothing
for me to be afraid of!

673
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:05,285
Nice touch, Emi.

674
01:02:17,303 --> 01:02:19,703
I guess it's time to get rid of
some excess baggage.

675
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,069
Gotcha!

676
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:51,128
Mr. Saeba!

677
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:04,481
You'll be okay in this car.
You don't need to stay here.

678
01:03:29,442 --> 01:03:30,743
Made it.

679
01:03:30,743 --> 01:03:30,944
Why did you come back?
Made it.

680
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:32,434
Why did you come back?

681
01:03:33,346 --> 01:03:39,185
I can't leave Kaori here alone,
and I have a duty!

682
01:03:39,185 --> 01:03:40,812
I have to see the end of the story!

683
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:50,997
Are you all right? No injuries?

684
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:56,196
All passengers remaining in the car are
safe. Repeating: All passengers...

685
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,972
It's me, Chief.

686
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:13,720
There is a manhole near each place I
gave you in the instructions before.

687
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,589
Start dropping the cash into them now.

688
01:04:16,589 --> 01:04:19,025
Into the sewer system?

689
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:20,593
Yes.


690
01:04:20,593 --> 01:04:22,857
Finish within fifteen minutes.

691
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:31,303
Bank of Japan

692
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:37,835
Some of the packages we are throwing
into the sewers contain transmitters.

693
01:04:38,244 --> 01:04:40,246
According to the data from
the transmitters

694
01:04:40,246 --> 01:04:42,373
this is the predicted direction
and the final destination.

695
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,952
The West Ochiai Water Filtration Plant.

696
01:04:45,952 --> 01:04:51,515
I think the Professor and his group
intend to pick up the packages there.

697
01:04:51,858 --> 01:04:56,763
Deploy the police troops immediately,
without being recognized!

698
01:04:56,763 --> 01:04:58,492
Yes, Sir!

699
01:05:09,943 --> 01:05:11,911
Thank you for calling Yomiuri TV.

700
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:21,820
West Ochiai Water Filtration Plant

701
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:31,366
We're running out of time!
Take positions immediately!

702
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:04,234
Repeating!

703
01:06:04,234 --> 01:06:06,737
This is a message from the
Yamate bomb suspect

704
01:06:06,737 --> 01:06:09,807
who requested the government
give him ten billion yen:

705
01:06:09,807 --> 01:06:12,810
The ten billion yen will be a
small present from him

706
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:16,113
to the Japanese citizens who
have been exploited.

707
01:06:16,113 --> 01:06:19,116
You can pick up your present at the
West Ochiai Water Filtration Plant!

708
01:06:19,116 --> 01:06:20,583
I don't have time to read the news!

709
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,458
It's no good! We can't control them!
It's impossible to control them!

710
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,327
The number of the people gathering
here is increasing.

711
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:32,921
It could be several thousand,
or more than ten thousand!

712
01:06:36,133 --> 01:06:37,600
Damn!

713
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,144
Ryo, talk to me! Ryo!

714
01:07:06,964 --> 01:07:09,558
I've picked up about a billion.

715
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,967
Withdraw from there now.

716
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:17,033
Not so fast. Why don't
we get all of them?

717
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:20,543
Do you think it will be possible to carry
ten billion in cash out of there?

718
01:07:22,012 --> 01:07:23,479
But...

719
01:07:23,847 --> 01:07:27,977
It's enough to get a billion yen.
The purpose is not the money.

720
01:07:31,855 --> 01:07:33,652
How stubborn he is. Really!

721
01:07:39,596 --> 01:07:42,656
Nothing good happens to you
if you're too greedy.

722
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:02,920
Where did you get this helicopter?

723
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,121
I picked it up.

724
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:04,421
Picked it up?
I picked it up.

725
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:05,589
Picked it up?

726
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,756
Picked it up?
It was just sitting there.

727
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:07,724
It was just sitting there.

728
01:08:07,724 --> 01:08:09,191
Where?

729
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:14,327
Hey, what's going on there?

730
01:08:20,904 --> 01:08:22,806
Right, Falcon?

731
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:24,933
It's their fault for leaving this there.

732
01:08:32,482 --> 01:08:35,042
The train has just passed
the Omori Station.

733
01:08:35,752 --> 01:08:37,454
Chief, make up your mind please.

734
01:08:37,454 --> 01:08:41,049
According to the report, there are
only two people on the train.

735
01:08:42,059 --> 01:08:43,660
Chief!

736
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,890
Contact the Prime Minister.

737
01:08:54,104 --> 01:08:56,004
It changed its route.

738
01:08:56,673 --> 01:08:58,608
They are giving them up.

739
01:08:58,608 --> 01:09:02,738
They weighed them in the balance.
TWO lives or Shinjuku.

740
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,880
I won't forgive them!

741
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:14,713
Chief, your daughter... Sorry, Inspector
Nogami is on the phone for you.

742
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:20,864
The chief does not have to take phone
calls from an inspector!

743
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:22,331
Yes, Sir!

744
01:09:28,805 --> 01:09:31,141
If the train continues as it is, it will
reach a dead-end at the train depot.

745
01:09:31,141 --> 01:09:33,109
Are you listening to me, Ryo?

746
01:09:34,478 --> 01:09:36,446
The government is cruel, isn't it?

747
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:39,716
Umibouzu, what do you have?

748
01:09:39,716 --> 01:09:44,054
A rocket launcher, an M-60
and an anti-tank rifle.

749
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:47,557
Use the rifle on the rails.

750
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:50,660
No way! If you make a tiny mistake, the
train will be derailed and will overturn!

751
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,629
It won't be any different
if it continues as it is!

752
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:56,433
Miki, go lower!

753
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:57,401
Umibouzu!

754
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:57,934
Don't worry. Trust his skill.
Umibouzu!

755
01:09:57,934 --> 01:10:00,027
Don't worry. Trust his skill.

756
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:09,879
Miki!

757
01:10:19,723 --> 01:10:21,190
It's ready, Falcon!

758
01:10:24,961 --> 01:10:26,428
Not yet. Once more!

759
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,440
Damn...

760
01:11:05,335 --> 01:11:06,802
Thank God!

761
01:11:15,812 --> 01:11:18,645
Well, what shall we do now?

762
01:11:40,971 --> 01:11:43,098
Oh, no! That line is...

763
01:11:43,607 --> 01:11:46,309
What? The Central Line?!

764
01:11:46,309 --> 01:11:49,579
Idiot! What were you trying to do,
make it take a short cut?

765
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:53,913
Shut up! It's your fault you came up
with such a stupid, brainless idea!

766
01:11:57,921 --> 01:12:01,224
Currently, the train is moving toward
Ochanomizu on the Central Line.


767
01:12:01,224 --> 01:12:06,821
Comparing the two routes, the Yamate
and Central Lines as they are now,

768
01:12:07,063 --> 01:12:10,055
the time on the Central Line will be ten
minutes shorter than on the Yamate.

769
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:16,473
Order the police and Self Defense
forces guarding Shinjuku to evacuate!

770
01:12:16,473 --> 01:12:17,940
Yes, Sir!

771
01:12:57,781 --> 01:13:03,276
One, and-a-two, three...

772
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:18,368
Aren't you going to evacuate?

773
01:13:18,368 --> 01:13:20,136
Same question to you too.

774
01:13:20,136 --> 01:13:24,630
This is my town. I don't have
anywhere to go.

775
01:13:29,879 --> 01:13:34,748
Me too. Also, I trust Ryo.

776
01:13:36,786 --> 01:13:39,346
If I have to die, I would
rather die with him.

777
01:13:47,397 --> 01:13:50,900
You thought it would work. Sorry, I'm
gonna tell you one good thing.

778
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,902
No matter what time it is,

779
01:13:52,902 --> 01:13:59,307
the bomb will explode when the train
arrives in Shinjuku for the second time.

780
01:14:00,377 --> 01:14:06,077
It's impossible to disarm the bomb.
It's the best work I've ever done.

781
01:14:06,416 --> 01:14:08,618
Do you want to try?

782
01:14:08,618 --> 01:14:11,052
Umibouzu, you have that
launcher, don't you?

783
01:14:26,002 --> 01:14:28,004
Are you gonna leave them alone?

784
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:32,304
This is a game. It's fun when the
enemy struggles against us.

785
01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:35,907
Understand? We have only one chance.

786
01:14:56,966 --> 01:14:58,433
Mr. Saeba?!

787
01:15:01,037 --> 01:15:03,028
Hi, Emi!

788
01:15:11,314 --> 01:15:15,182
How do you feel now that you're
on your masterpiece?

789
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:19,079
If you want to live, you
know what to do!

790
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:31,427
The only thing I have to do now is to
disarm the board in this control.

791
01:15:31,801 --> 01:15:33,136
Hurry up!

792
01:15:33,136 --> 01:15:33,303
Don't push me around.
Hurry up!

793
01:15:33,303 --> 01:15:34,770
Don't push me around.

794
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,779
Now to cut the insulated cord...

795
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:46,583
Why don't you hurry up
and cut the cord?

796
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:48,952
NO! If I cut the wrong one,
we are dead!

797
01:15:48,952 --> 01:15:50,977
Don't do anything stupid!

798
01:15:53,523 --> 01:15:56,583
Well, that's just great.

799
01:16:14,177 --> 01:16:15,940
The Professor...

800
01:16:16,513 --> 01:16:18,003
Miki!

801
01:16:38,968 --> 01:16:41,438
Get close to the train.
I'm going to finish him.

802
01:16:41,438 --> 01:16:45,340
Are you out of your mind? We're
too close to Shinjuku Station.

803
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:47,310
Go closer.

804
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:47,544
Damn! You're insane! You're
playing with danger!
Go closer.

805
01:16:47,544 --> 01:16:51,207
Damn! You're insane! You're
playing with danger!

806
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:56,707
There's a man down there who
has been waiting for me.

807
01:17:13,369 --> 01:17:15,860
I'm happy, City Hunter.

808
01:17:17,273 --> 01:17:22,006
I need to thank God for giving me a
chance to meet a man like you.

809
01:17:23,313 --> 01:17:25,941
Do you believe in the existence of God?

810
01:17:26,749 --> 01:17:30,446
I've met him before, on the
battlefield in the desert.

811
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:38,461
Enemies approaching me. Bombs
being poured over my head.

812
01:17:38,461 --> 01:17:43,900
Then, for the first time in my life, I felt
like I was alive, and I thanked God.

813
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,903
I'm sure you understand how I felt.

814
01:17:46,903 --> 01:17:50,139
Even if you deny it, you and I are
the same kind of human.

815
01:17:50,139 --> 01:17:55,600
In other words, we are humans who
only feel alive in situations like this.

816
01:17:56,279 --> 01:17:59,578
You're wrong. You're limited
to that kind of thinking.

817
01:18:00,316 --> 01:18:01,584
Is that so?

818
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:01,818
I have more important things than that.
Is that so?

819
01:18:01,818 --> 01:18:03,786
I have more important things than that.

820
01:18:04,654 --> 01:18:07,020
That's going to be your limit then.

821
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:19,501
Kaori...

822
01:18:21,604 --> 01:18:23,629
Ryo!

823
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:39,522
The Python is a good gun,

824
01:18:39,522 --> 01:18:41,990
but it can only hold six bullets.

825
01:18:42,992 --> 01:18:45,995
It's good to love something like that,

826
01:18:45,995 --> 01:18:49,658
but it's stupid to lose your life for it.

827
01:19:55,164 --> 01:19:58,190
Why don't we resolve this issue?

828
01:19:58,768 --> 01:20:01,904
What are you going to do if you win?

829
01:20:01,904 --> 01:20:07,274
All of Shinjuku will disappear.
Along with this train.

830
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:14,116
Stop!

831
01:20:52,955 --> 01:20:54,445
Brother!

832
01:20:55,425 --> 01:20:57,689
Damn it!

833
01:21:16,412 --> 01:21:18,812
I can't hold this any longer! Hang on!

834
01:21:34,363 --> 01:21:38,561
Chief, only one minute, thirty seconds
before the train reaches Shinjuku.

835
01:21:44,874 --> 01:21:46,341
Ryo...

836
01:21:51,681 --> 01:21:58,688
City Hunter, I lost the fight,
but the victory is mine.

837
01:21:58,688 --> 01:22:02,249
You can't disarm the bomb.

838
01:22:04,393 --> 01:22:06,759
Kaori, what color are the wires?

839
01:22:09,532 --> 01:22:16,700
Red, white, blue, yellow,
black and green.

840
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:27,216
The probability is one in six. Do you
pray to God for protection?

841
01:22:27,216 --> 01:22:30,879
I don't have enough confidence
to trust my luck to God.

842
01:22:37,059 --> 01:22:38,526
This is my way.

843
01:22:58,948 --> 01:23:01,284
Kaori, it's the sexy blue one!

844
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:04,954
Idiot! Idiot! Are you seriously going to
decide based on something like that?

845
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:07,013
I have confidence in my hard-on!

846
01:23:07,356 --> 01:23:08,983
What an idiot!

847
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:11,259
I wonder if it will be okay?

848
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:13,688
We can't do anything except watch.

849
01:23:18,734 --> 01:23:20,395
Trust me!

850
01:23:55,671 --> 01:23:59,742
You decided the most important thing
based on your sex drive?!

851
01:23:59,742 --> 01:24:02,011
It's good because we are all safe!

852
01:24:02,011 --> 01:24:04,980
It's not good!

853
01:24:12,321 --> 01:24:19,921
I didn't know a man like him existed.
I guess this world might be okay.

854
01:24:26,369 --> 01:24:28,803
I don't need it any more.

855
01:24:31,874 --> 01:24:38,746
The treasure for me has been
your smiling face.

856
01:24:39,382 --> 01:24:43,318
Let me see your smile again.

857
01:24:44,654 --> 01:24:47,384
Brother...

858
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:55,792
Good. That's good.

859
01:26:04,264 --> 01:26:10,669
Asphalt tire o kiritsukenagara

861
01:26:18,879 --> 01:26:22,582
It's your pain or my pain or
somebody's pain

01:26:22,582 --> 01:26:26,219
Dareka no tame ni ikirareru nara

863
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:29,656
It's your dream or my dream or
somebody's dream

The best in Japan!

874
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,358
Ryo! Wonderful!

875
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:29,170
I'm so embarrassed!

876
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,439
Well, enjoy!

877
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,304
Oh, thanks.

878
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,779
Hey, Emi, what are you
doing over there?

879
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:40,213
Come here and see to your fans.

880
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,553
Are you sure that's good for you, Miki?

881
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:48,089
I'm so damn sorry.

882
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,717
Hey, Miki, it's spilling over.

883
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:53,687
Now hold hands with each other!

884
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:04,195
No, you're not a little kid.
Hold closer! There!

885
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:12,444
Holy cow! Now he's useless.

886
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,950
Here, I know you've been
waiting for these.

887
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:29,527
X-rated videos!

888
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:54,677
It's dangerous for you to watch
stuff like this, isn't it?

889
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,690
I guess so.

893
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:37,988
See you again!

894
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:50,742
My mind is freezing!
