Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, seiza no kieta sora

00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, joushiki no nai michi

Stop searching immediately!!

29
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,928
Dangerous Detective Game!
A Python for the Lady
(Part 1)

30
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,810
You want me to teach someone
to use a gun?!

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,869
No way! I'm not taking a shady job like...

32
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,753
She's cute!

33
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,190
That's our client. Well? Satisfactory, isn't she?

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,825
No, let's not.


35
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,283
Teaching a girl like that to use
a lethal weapon is...

36
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,957
So? Where's the meeting place?

37
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,837
You were just saying something about
not accepting this!

38
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,406
Well, I still should meet her first.

39
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,601
I'm a conscientious person, you see.

40
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,206
Here, take this with you then.

41
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,947
What's this?

42
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,006
It's a charm to drive away
your carnal desires.

43
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,644
No!

44
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,324
Stop it already! I'll go report you!

45
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,425
Don't be so cold.

46
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,095
I'm really lucky to have met a girl like you!

47
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,130
No!

48
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,331
Wait for me!

49
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,632
No!

50
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,001
Come on, let's have some tea!
He's late. I guess rumors aren't
worth listening to after all.

51
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,002
Oh, just leave me alone!
He's late. I guess rumors aren't
worth listening to after all.

52
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,003
Just one cup!
He's late. I guess rumors aren't
worth listening to after all.

53
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:24,837
Just one cup!
Not a single person's showed up
that looks like a sweeper.

54
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,206
Give it a rest already!
Not a single person's showed up
that looks like a sweeper.

55
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,940
You'd make me so happy!
Not a single person's showed up
that looks like a sweeper.

56
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,441
You'd make me so happy!
But what is with that man?

57
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,842
You're so pesky!
But what is with that man?

58
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,311
Come on, let's have tea! Tea!
He's been chasing women for
an hour already.

59
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,979
I said, leave me alone!
He's been chasing women for
an hour already.

60
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,037
Go away!

61
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,020
Pervert! Weirdo!

62
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,823
I wonder how many more women he'll need
to treat him like that before he learns?

63
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,831
At this rate, all the lights in the
park are going to be...

64
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,500
Well, I can't wait any longer.

65
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,903
What's wrong? Did your boyfriend
stand you up?

66
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,206
Oh, wait up, Lady!

67
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,652
Ow!

68
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:17,523
Are you okay? You're so cute.
Want to go on a date with me?

69
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,492
No!

70
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,760
Please forgive me!

71
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,833
What an extreme reaction. You don't
have to scream so loud.

72
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,300
I'm just...

73
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,399
Man, so noisy, and at a time like this.

74
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,313
Who is he?

75
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,780
He's got a gun.

76
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,078
He's got to be a yakuza or
something after all.

77
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,285
A gun...

78
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,524
I know that! I haven't laid
a single finger on her!

79
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,926
But is it really her?

80
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,329
She's got this easy-going,
well brought up lady aura.

81
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,132
She's got bad coordination, and
she seems weak-willed.

82
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,667
You sure I got the right girl?

83
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,836
I'm sure! Accept the job, all right?!

84
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,633
Our livelihood's on the line!

85
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,740
Man, she's so noisy!

86
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:18,017
I'm sorry for screaming so loudly earlier.

87
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,384
Would you care to go for a drink
with me to make up for it?

88
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,024
She wants to go for a drink all of a sudden?

89
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,993
Her attitude's completely changed.

90
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,900
My plan's working.

91
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,640
He doesn't seem all that strong,
so if I get him dead drunk,

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,335
I think even I could steal his gun from him.

93
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:47,812
And a perverted yakuza like him with
a gun won't come to any good.

94
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,086
What?!

95
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,322
What's going on? The world's spinning!

96
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,857
Hey, what is it?

97
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,324
What's wrong?

98
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,628
That's stwange.

99
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,699
I had thwee bowls of sweet fermented
wice when I was a kid,

100
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,634
and Papa said I had a lot of tolewance.

101
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,305
Are you really drunk?
You've only had two sips!

102
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:17,176
This is bad. It's getting fuzzy.
I'm going to get dead dwunk first.

103
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,973
I have to do something.

104
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,942
More yakuza? There are a lot of
yakuza awound today.

105
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:33,451
I know! If I can get them to knock out
this punk yakuza...

106
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,028
Hey, damn yakuza!

107
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:41,100
This isn't a place for people
like you, now is it?!

108
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,104
Twying to act cool with shades!

109
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,628
That's so stupid!

110
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,542
Hey, sister, I'd stop there if I were you,
or you'll regret...

111
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,849
What're you actin' all tough for?

112
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,085
Damn bitch!

113
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,887
No!

114
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,822
Oh, help me!

115
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,255
Hey, now...

116
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,627
You gonna fight for her, boy?

117
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,396
That's wight! He's stwong!

118
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,864
Interesting...


119
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,033
Hey, wait...

120
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,435
Shut up!

121
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,063
Bro, that man's... You know...

122
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,702
City...

123
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,115
Pardon us!

124
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,313
Hey! Stop! What're you, wimps?!

125
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,446
Man, again?! What a pain!

126
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:48,962
Damn it, what about my gun? All wight,
since it's come to this...

127
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,705
Good boy, good boy.

128
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,906
Hello? It's me.

129
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,373
Hey, Kaori?

130
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,102
AIEEEE!

131
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,912
What's wrong, Ryo?! What happened?! Hey!

132
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,657
I finally got it, but...

133
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,164
I was drunk, but still, what a
horrible thing I've done.

134
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,941
Weird yakuza man, I will make sure to
make a formal apology to you.

135
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,603
And I'll also pay your medical bills,
so please forgive me.

136
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,051
So, this is a real gun.

137
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,792
It's so heavy, I wonder if I'll
be able to use it?

138
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,125
I think you're supposed to do this
and the bullets...

139
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,234
Oh, I'm so clumsy. I should take
better care of it.

140
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,567
Oh? There aren't any bullets in it.

141
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,043
What could this be?

142
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:09,948
Those who need to learn how to use
a gun and bullets, please turn to
your right and say "woof".
Yours truly, City Hunter

143
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,285
City Hunter?

144
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,720
Turn to my right...

145
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,187
Woof!

146
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,190
Hi!

147
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,425
You!

148
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,296
It's dangerous. That's something
you use to kill people.

149
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,033
No, I... This is to protect myself.

150
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,770
I need it right now for the case
that I'm dealing with.

151
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,971
I see.

152
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,533
So, that's why you wanted City Hunter,
me, to give you lessons.

153
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,643
You are...

154
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,547
Are you really City Hunter?!

155
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,616
Of course, my real name is Ryo Saeba.

156
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,519
You're terrible! If you'd said so
from the beginning,

157
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,487
none of this would've happened!

158
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,258
You were ridiculing me, watching the
things I did, weren't you?!

159
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,826
That's not true.

160
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,029
I accept jobs after I find out the
person's true intentions.

161
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,799
Someone like you wanting to use a gun...

162
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,702
I can't just teach you how to use one
without knowing the reason.

163
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,670
It really was terrible of you.

164
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:10,504
But it seems that you qualify
as a client. I'm sorry.

165
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,006
Then you'll teach me?

166
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:19,216
Of course, and your charming lips
also qualify...

167
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,421
You didn't make your scheduled call,
and sure enough!

168
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,946
Drive Away Carnal Desires
You didn't make your scheduled call,
and sure enough!

169
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,463
Detective?!

170
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,232
What is someone like you
doing as a detective?

171
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,668
My father, who was a detective,

172
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,937
passed away last year due to an illness.

173
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,006
I took over the agency.

174
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,201
Your father's work...

175
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,680
And you ended up accepting
a dangerous job.

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,409
But what kind of job is it?

177
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,555
I know that, as a detective, you
can't talk about your jobs,

178
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,290
but the circumstances are different now.

179
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,917
Please tell me.

180
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,358
Okay, actually...

181
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,295
My job...

182
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,826
is to find this dog.

183
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,642
This beats all!

184
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,678
A client, who wants to learn
how to use a gun,

185
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,446
is looking for a dog!

186
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,936
This sure beats all!

187
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,283
Please don't laugh!

188
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:29,355
But your life is in danger because
you're searching for a dog?!

189
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,392
It's true! A car followed me last night
and tried to run me over!

190
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,295
I get threatening calls and other
harassing things done to me!

191
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,497
You're terrible, laughing at me like that!

192
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,066
You're terrible!

193
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,368
You idiot! She's crying!

194
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,502
You laughed too!

195
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,594
Yes, but...

196
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,846
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

197
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,116
I know! That dog must be special somehow!

198
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,084
Like maybe he's the only one of
his kind in the world!

199
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:07,193
No, he's just a mixed breed. He belongs
to a six-year-old girl,

200
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,559
and she wants him found no matter what.

201
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,929
Well, what'll we do, Miss Kaori?

202
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,127
We already accepted the job. I don't think
we have much choice.

203
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,385
Wow! I thought you were just a pervert,


204
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,988
but I guess the one thing you've got is
amazing shooting skills!

205
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:40,084
Hey, Kaori, you start off by
teaching her how to fire.

206
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,295
I can't!

207
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:47,166
Aiko, Kaori is the right arm of the
world's greatest sweeper.

208
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,636
You're very lucky to have a teacher like her.

209
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,471
Yes, thank you very much!

210
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,373
No, I'm not really that...

211
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,342
What're you being so humble for?

212
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,011
After all, Kaori's wild shooting is
the greatest in the world!

213
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,081
She's practically stronger than me!

214
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:06,585
All right, I'll teach you everything!
Leave it to me!

215
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,720
Okay, I'm counting on you!

216
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,187
Okay!

217
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,890
This is how it should be.

218
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,358
You don't need a gun to look for a dog.

219
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,530
But from the way she was acting yesterday,

220
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,260
it seems true that someone is targeting her.

221
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,929
She's only looking for a lost dog. Why?


222
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,874
Oh, don't strain yourself so much.
Relax, relax.

223
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,240
Okay! Here I go!

224
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,648
Are you okay?

225
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,817
This gun hurts my hand a lot!

226
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,053
Maybe going right into shooting
was too much for Miss Aiko.

227
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,146
At this rate, she won't even hit the target.

228
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,326
Oh! Miss Kaori! I hit it!

229
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,862
Well, I guess it's a beginning.

230
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,832
If you practice more, you'll be able
to hit dead center.

231
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,767
Yes, I'll do my best!

232
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,736
Then I'll show you an example.

233
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,605
Yes, please!

234
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,541
I can't lose! I have to hit dead center!

235
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,946
It looks like she's straining a lot,

236
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,415
but I guess this is the natural relaxed form.

237
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,905
Miss Kaori's awesome!

238
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,189
She didn't hit it?

239
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,387
I was just warming up. Here comes
the real thing.

240
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,161
Take this!

241
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,631
And that!

242
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,098
And this!

243
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,139
This is bad. The more I panic,
the wider the shots go.

244
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,734
My final bullet, I've got to get
this shot somehow.

245
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,314
I slipped!

246
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,781
Oh, shoot!

247
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,458
Wow! Dead center!

248
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,729
But what happened just now?
It hit in a strange way...

249
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,766
No, no, no, well, that takes a lot
of technique, you see.

250
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,434
It's called the Two-Stage Shot.

251
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,669
I'm good with guns,

252
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,739
but even I can only make that shot
one time out of six.

253
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,409
That's amazing! I'll work hard to
get to be like you too!

254
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,341
Really...

255
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,480
Hey, Kaori.

256
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,812
Take this!

257
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,885
And this! And that! There, there, there!

258
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,453
Take that! And take this! And that!

259
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,021
Kaori, what is all this?
Take that! And take this! And that!

260
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,622
Kaori, what is all this?
There! This! That!

261
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,657
There! This! That!


262
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,616
The more I teach her, the wilder
the bullets fly.

263
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,096
It's like there are two Kaori's now.

264
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,036
Miss Kaori, I'm finally getting the
hang of the Two-Stage Shot.

265
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,171
What's this Two-Stage Shot?!

266
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,574
Well, you know, you do it once in a while too.

267
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,032
Watch me. I'll aim at the steel beam
on the ceiling and...

268
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,206
No way!

269
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,354
Look! I hit the target once
every two shots now!

270
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,291
Maybe she's a genius.

271
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,758
Could be.

272
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,298
Hey, Miss Kaowi! Gimme another beer!

273
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,599
Okay, okay.

274
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,101
Now what's the commotion?

275
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,402
Oh, Ryo.

276
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,239
Miss Aiko said she couldn't sleep with the
excitement of firing a gun for the first time.

277
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,474
So I gave her a beer...

278
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,609
You gave her a beer?!

279
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,778
Don't be so stingy, damn it.

280
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,481
I can't just stop with one dwink!

281
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,785
Hey, Saeba, you dwink too! C'mon!

282
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,846
All wight! Let's dwink, all thwee of us!

283
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,034
I don't feel so good.

284
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,526
Oh, yeah, after that, Miss Aiko made us
drink with her and...

285
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,330
Miss Aiko's bed is empty!

286
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,280
Ryo's not here either!

287
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,805
And he left behind the
drive-away-carnal-desires beeper!

288
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,582
I've been had.

289
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,323
You're so kind, Mr. Saeba,

290
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,292
searching for the dog with me like this.

291
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,629
Well, until you become skilled with a gun,

292
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,365
I have to protect you, you see.

293
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,961
Yeah, right. In other words, Kaori can't
bother me right now.

294
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,837
STOP LOOKING

295
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,642
This is terrible.

296
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,811
It's nasty for being just a prank.

297
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,446
It's always like this.

298
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,248
Every time I put up posters...

299
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,843
Someone is definitely trying to
interfere with her search.

300
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,953
And...

301
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,493
Someone's definitely been following
her for a while now.

302
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,256
But he's an amateur.

303
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,297
Is something wrong?

304
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,632
Oh, no, nothing.

305
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:50,202
I was thinking that you'd get nowhere
just searching randomly.

306
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:50,803
Runaway Dog

307
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,136
Runaway Dog
Do you know anything special about him,
like places he might go?

308
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,310
Come to think of it, this dog loves
beautiful female dogs,

309
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,945
and he goes after them all the time.

310
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,537
Like someone we know.

311
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,718
Beautiful dogs? Okay, I've got some ideas.

312
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,886
Really?!


313
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,376
You can count on me!

314
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,460
What's wrong?! Hurry up!

315
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,017
Right...

316
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,497
Are there dogs in a place like this?

317
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,734
There are. Hostesses usually
keep a dog or cat.

318
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:26,329
No, I haven't seen a dog like this.

319
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,134
What do you think, Chiro?

320
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,910
I'm sorry I wasn't much help, Ryo.

321
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,400
No, don't worry about it.

322
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,782
But he sure has no eyes to see with.

323
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,652
If I were this dog, I'd wag my tail
and rush to this place.

324
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,782
My, do you mean Chiro? Or...

325
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,759
Well, of course, who else?

326
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,828
Oh, Ryo!

327
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,364
Hey, Mr. Saeba!

328
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,133
Aren't you misunderstanding something?!

329
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,568
I said beautiful dogs!

330
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,538
This is a beauty who has a dog!

331
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,906
Well...

332
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,806
Pet Shop Boys

333
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,738
Did this dog ever come to bother
your female dogs?

334
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,083
No, haven't seen him, but...

335
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,217
But?

336
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,152
Your male is bothering my clerk.

337
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,289
Say, let's go on a date sometime.

338
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,722
Oh, please!

339
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,528
Really! Do you have any intention of
doing this seriously?!

340
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,030
But she was cute!

341
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,299
Besides, I'm tired of walking.

342
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,967
Jeez...

343
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,334
Well, Mr. Saeba, let's take
a break over there.

344
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,007
Lover's Land

345
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,235
Imperial Garden

346
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,674
Take a break?! This place is...

347
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,921
Aiko, do you come here often?

348
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,980
Yes, ever since I was little.

349
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,926
And she looks so innocent!

350
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,054
I guess girls mature more quickly these days!

351
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,664
Here we are.

352
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,332
Okay! Let's do it!

353
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,133
Kamimura Detective Agency
Okay! Let's do it!

354
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,729
Kamimura Detective Agency
This is my father's... No,
now it's my agency.

355
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,973
Agency?


356
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,804
Did you misunderstand again?

357
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,950
What an outdated looking office.

358
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,521
Yes, but I've always loved this place,
ever since I was little.

359
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,058
Here, my father's eyes looked so lively.

360
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,154
Unlike other, normal adults, his eyes
were like those of a boy.

361
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,788
It was wonderful,

362
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,232
even though unprofitable work like this
only brought hardships.

363
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,739
I thought if I tried being a detective too,

364
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,707
I'd discover the reason why.

365
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,810
Do you think it's strange?

366
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,471
Not at all.

367
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,153
Who the hell are you?

368
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,415
Uncle!

369
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,429
Uncle, this man is Mr. Saeba and...

370
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,398
Your assistant?! He looks like
a member of the yakuza!

371
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,836
I'm absolutely against it!

372
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,904
You aren't capable of being a detective!

373
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,475
Besides, you haven't even
graduated from college!

374
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,969
If it's about that, I already made a
promise with you the other day.

375
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,116
Searching for a dog is so trivial!

376
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,743
No, it is important work.

377
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,358
You're just like my younger brother!
Stubborn!

378
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,796
I'm sorry for the trouble.

379
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,198
What's this promise about?

380
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:44,936
My uncle was the one most against me
taking over my father's work.

381
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,605
But I persuaded him to let me try,

382
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,575
and I promised I'd give it up if
I couldn't solve my first case.

383
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,577
So, that's why.

384
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,044
Your uncle certainly has his own problems.

385
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,549
What was that?!

386
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,914
That was my uncle!

387
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,924
What happened, Uncle?!

388
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,093
They got my leg.

389
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,187
A car suddenly came straight for me, and...

390
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,698
The men inside said to make you
stop searching for the dog,

391
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,632
or else I would be in danger too.

392
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,744
Flying through the sunrise

393
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,714
Searching for the sunset

394
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:55,163
Mou kuchibeni kaete mo tokimekanai no yo

395
00:22:55,307 --> 00:23:00,609
Yume no iro ni wa toui kara

396
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:08,884
Hi no tama no you na asahi o mini iku tabi e

397
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:14,326
Moshi anata mo sasoetara

398
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:23,633
Hane no you ni maiagaruwa sora e

399
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:31,877
Atsuku naretara sore de ii

400
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:40,216
Kono mune ni kitto mienai hi ga noboru

401
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:48,182
Ookina mono o mitsumetai

402
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,699
Chiiisana tsuyogari mo hadashi no mama

403
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:59,830
Nigete yuku yo

404
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,013
Aiko's office is in the middle of
the hotel district! I love it!

405
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,015
Listen up, you wall-creep guy!

406
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,652
The man who owns the surrounding
buildings wants to get rid of the office.

407
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,786
Now what do you make of that?

408
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,390
But the one after Aiko is someone
completely separate.

409
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,425
What? He's not the one? Then who is it?

410
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,561
Is that dog so important?

411
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,762
City Hunter 3:

412
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,598
"Dangerous Detective Game!
A Python for the Lady (Part 2)"

413
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,623
It'll be even more dangerous
if you don't watch.
