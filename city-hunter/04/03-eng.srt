1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,608
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
One can a day
Careful, don't drink too much!
Hi
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,482
Frustration comes knocking on my door

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,319
Wolves that can't run

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,156
Wander around, clawing at the darkness

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,455
The last time I saw you

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
Was in the dusty crowds

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,401
Your accusing gaze

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,667
Left an ache in my back as I walked away

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,877
The roadway has been blocked by fog

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,680
Even now, I'm still looking for the answer

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,446
In the clueless night sky

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,388
The horizon stretches out

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, a sky
without constellations

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, a path
without common sense

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,244
Wow, wow, wow, seeking only kindness

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,907
Wow, wow, wow, facing loneliness

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,075
Wow, wow, wow, I don't need you like that

28
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,923
Ryo, what's wrong?!

29
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,533
Damn, they're persistent!

30
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,008
Freeze! If you don't want to die, leave now!

31
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,644
What are you trying to act cool for, Ryo?

32
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:55,248
You can say lines like that after
you've paid off your debt.

33
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,978
Anyway, I'll hang on to this as insurance.

34
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,111
The tools of my trade!

35
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,449
Even Kaori's Pissed!
Ryo & a Young Lady
~Pinch Hitter Marriage Story~

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,331
Damn it, this is what happens when you go
drinking when we don't have any money!

37
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,468
We never have money because you
refuse every female client!

38
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,165
What am I supposed to do without
the tools of my trade?!

39
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,942
Man, I guess I've got no choice.

40
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,105
I don't like it, but there's one client
who wants to hire us.

41
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,617
The meeting is at 1 PM in the lobby
of the Oshiuri TV Station.

42
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:34,383
The client is Miss Kanako Date.
Once you meet her, she'll tell...

43
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,490
Damn, he's so fast when it
comes to female clients.

44
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,305
Playing Detectives

45
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,465
Playing Detectives
No way!

46
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,775
It's truly a TV station.

47
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,711
This place is overflowing with a
future reserve of mokkori girls.

48
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,807
Even the secretary's awesome. Truly a
treasure trove of mokkori!

49
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,118
This is a good place to know.
I'll make sure to remember it.

50
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,761
And here comes a real tasty looking mokkori!

51
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,296
You're Mr. Saeba?

52
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,897
Yes, yes, then you're...

53
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,900
Kanako Date, I'm so happy that
you accepted my offer.

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,304
Beautiful clients are always welcome.

55
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,506
By the way, what do you want me to do?

56
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,998
It's simple. I want you to
appear on TV with me.

57
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,745
You mean this "Playing Detectives" thing?



58
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,144
No, that one.

59
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,610
Newlyweds
Come
on Over

60
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,053
That's pitiful!

61
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,057
A pro would never allow his gun to be
taken away as insurance!

62
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,859
Oh, but it's all my fault!

63
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,429
I just can't help but decline female clients,

64
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,464
so we always end up being short on cash.

65
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,796
Here you go, Kaori, on the house.

66
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,436
Thank you!

67
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,038
Oh, do you mind if I turn the TV on?

68
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,242
"Come on Over, Newlyweds"
is really fun to watch.

69
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,309
Sure.

70
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:03,934
Come on Over

71
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,681
We're here to broadcast the sweet newlywed
life to the length and breadth of Japan.

72
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,317
It is now time for "Come on Over,
Newlyweds."

73
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,320
And here is our couple who will show us

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,083
their sweet newlywed life today!

75
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,659
What?!

76
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,421
Saeba!



77
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,697
With us today, we have Mr. Ryo Saeba
and his wife, Mrs. Kanako.

78
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,501
Now, please tell us about your
sweet newlywed life.

79
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,638
Ryo is just all over me all the time!

80
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,472
Well, if I had such a sweet, young wife,
I would be too.

81
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,011
Ryo says that to me too.

82
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,747
He tells me that he adores me
more than anything.

83
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,348
My, how delicious.

84
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,509
Hey, what in the world is this?

85
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,888
Come on, say it to me like you
always do. Please!

86
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:53,416
Yeah! I adore you more than anything!

87
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,862
Oh, really?! I'm sure you don't find
me adorable at all!

88
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:02,068
By the way, Madam, what do you like most
about your husband?

89
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,370
His vulgar mokkori of course!

90
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,806
Mokkori is it?!

91
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,274
Ever since we were married,

92
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,677
he'll mokkori for me ten, twenty times a day.

93
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,771
He's just like a walking, talking mokkori.

94
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,450
I'll never forgive him! He got married
without telling me!

95
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,718
Calm down, Kaori!

96
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,752
That bastard! Let me go!

97
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,447
Don't break our TV!


98
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,879
We'll take a commercial break now.

99
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,868
I won't allow it!

100
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:36,302
Oshiuri TV Station

101
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,637
Oshiuri TV Station
Now, let's hear your explanation.
What's going on?

102
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,906
Now, let's hear your explanation.
What's going on?

103
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,442
There's nothing to explain.
It's just like you saw it.

104
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,576
What?

105
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,646
Threatening me with a thing like this,
were you testing me?

106
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,114
Oh, you knew?

107
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,616
I do make a living off of this.

108
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,107
Well, I'll explain it to you later. Get in.

109
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,460
Wow, a Ferrari Testarossa!

110
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,062
Doesn't this cost tens of millions of yen?

111
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,865
I don't know. I never ask the price.

112
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,594
I see.

113
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,072
I'm a rough driver. Hang on tight.

114
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,039
Sure thing.


115
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,915
Oh, darn it. It's the seventh one
I've wrecked this year.

116
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,553
Seventh one?

117
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,180
Of these expensive ones...

118
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,555
The accelerators on these cars are
hard to manage, you know.

119
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,534
So, is that the man you say
you married, Ms. Kanako?


120
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,703
Right, he's my darling.

121
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:48,367
Pardon me, but he does not seem like a man
suitable for you, no matter how I look at him.

122
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,510
It's none of your business!

123
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,180
I'm sure he's just after your money,

124
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,449
just like all the other men.

125
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,576
And what about you?

126
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,154
Don't be ridiculous.

127
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:06,225
The three-pointed star on this car
should be proof enough of that.

128
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,628
How utterly offensive!

129
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,263
This is Mr. Toru Kazama.

130
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,001
What? Him? I knew I'd seen him before,

131
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,702
but I still don't know him.

132
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,205
I'm the heir to Kazama Industries,

133
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,774
a large corporation and a leader
of Japanese industry!

134
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,243
I'm nothing like the scoundrel that you are!


135
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,346
Oh, really? I guess you're
an important person.

136
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,149
Well, we can leave the future of Japan
in little Kazama's hands.

137
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,219
Let's hurry up and get home
so we can mokkori.

138
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,554
Bye-bye!

139
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,021
Hurry, hurry.

140
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,123
Damn...

141
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,789
Miss Kanako!

142
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,603
Who are these guys?

143
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,264
My suitors.

144
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,676
Ms. Kanako, is it true that
you've gotten married?

145
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,611
Yes, it's true.

146
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,582
So give up on me already and
quit following me around.

147
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,450
Come on. Let's go, Darling.

148
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,418
But...

149
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:13,926
I see. I'm playing the husband to keep
those pesky suitors away.

150
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,830
Right, my money is all that they want.

151
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,096
But isn't that Kazama Corporation's
heir different?

152
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,337
I just hate him on principle.

153
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,406
You saw him and his upstart, sarcastic ways.

154
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:31,035
Relationships between men and
women sure are difficult.

155
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,384
Which one do you want?

156
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:44,154
You're my husband now. I'd like you
to have a suitable car.

157
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,660
None of them are really my style.

158
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,161
If I absolutely had to decide...

159
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,526
I like that one!

160
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:57,459
A 1964 Volvo 122S. Man, that's pretty trendy!


161
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,973
Well, Sir, that car is about to be scrapped.


162
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,744
It is hardly something for
Mrs. Kanako to ride in.

163
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,304
If you're going to scrap it, then
I'll take it off your hands!

164
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,887
What a discovery.

165
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,256
I never knew that other cars were so fast.

166
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,919
Well, I thought we shouldn't lose our
little friend back there.

167
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,063
I don't know that car.

168
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,260
Then maybe it's the beginning of a chase
between two historic cars.

169
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,618
Damn!

170
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,754
That's a Volvo for you! Old, but still
the toughest in the world!

171
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,188
Oh, a pincer attack?

172
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,193
I see, so that's it.

173
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,830
You're being targeted, so you wanted
me to be your bodyguard.

174
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,899
Then why didn't you say so
in the first place?

175
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,034
You sure took a roundabout way
of telling me.

176
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,670
You're wrong. You're the one being targeted.

177
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,771
What?

178
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,329
Get out, Mister.

179
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,211
No kidding, it looks like I'm the target.

180
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,213
Shut up and move!

181
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,271
Yes, Sir.

182
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,888
They didn't!

183
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,485
Mr. Saeba!

184
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,761
Disappointed that they didn't kill me?

185
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,831
No! I really was worried!

186
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,768
Of course I didn't think the City Hunter
would be killed so easily

187
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,201
if the reports are true.

188
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,241
So you wanted my skills as
the City Hunter after all.

189
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,077
And I guess you've already done
your research on me.

190
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,214
Yes, I even know that though
you're good at what you do,

191
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,910
you've got a thing for beautiful women,
which can be a weakness.

192
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,020
Please forgive us!

193
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,622
We didn't know that you were
the City Hunter!

194
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,623
We meant no disrespect!

195
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,225
Why are you after me?

196
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:04,363
Right! We were hired over the phone to kill
the man who married Miss Kanako.

197
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,432
Meaning, you don't know who hired you.

198
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,902
Yes, you're truly the City Hunter.
You grasp the situation quickly.

199
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:10,869
Beat it!

200
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,373
We're sorry!

201
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,576
Now, since you've done your research,

202
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,713
you know that you'll be paying
in mokkori, right?

203
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,981
Of course.

204
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,985
You are my husband, after all.
Mokkori comes with the territory.

205
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,787
Let's go to my condo.

206
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,556
What a job benefit!

207
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,093
Have things ever progressed
this smoothly before?!

208
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,118
Come on, the sooner the mokkori the better.

209
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,630
Oh my, so this car can go fast.

210
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,934
City Hunter?

211
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,552
What floor is your room on?

212
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,020
All of them.

213
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,284
This entire building is my home.

214
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,453
So, he's been living in a luxurious
condo like that?

215
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,465
My, what a wonderful room!

216
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,802
I'm a lucky boy to be able to spend my newly
married life in a great place like this!

217
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,704
Make yourself at home for a while.

218
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,574
I'll go change, so it'll be easier to mokkori.

219
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,667
Sure thing! Don't be long!

220
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,715
Yes! Finally I get to mokkori on my 117th try.



221
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,551
My two and a half year-long
devotion has paid off!

222
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,418
I'm so glad I'm the City Hunter!

223
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,350
I'm pretty sure it was this floor.

224
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,222
Maybe I heard something.

225
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,067
Welcome, you're Miss Kaori Makimura, right?

226
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,769
Yes, that's right.

227
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,937
How did you know my name?

228
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,336
Kanako?

229
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,075
Ryo can't wait anymore.

230
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,476
Hurry!

231
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,740
Young girls are so impatient!

232
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,445
Kanako!

233
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,584
This ought to teach you, Mr. Mokkori!

234
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,075
That was Kaori's voice...

235
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:14,160
You've got some guts getting married
without telling me!

236
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,328
No! No! That was just an act!

237
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,229
Liar!

238
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,764
It's true.

239
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,499
I'm Kanako Date.

240
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,802
I made an appointment to meet you
at the TV station.

241
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,170
Oh, yeah.

242
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,840
They only mentioned your first name
on TV, so I didn't notice.

243
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,076
She's the President of the Date Group,
whose assets amount to forty billion,

244
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,879
and they own fifty buildings
in this town alone.

245
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:39,044
I think I heard last year that the father died
and his only daughter inherited everything.

246
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,853
You knew?

247
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,923
Well, this building belongs
to the Date Group.

248
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,193
But why did you pretend to get married?

249
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,728
I wanted to drive away my pesky suitors.

250
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,391
After all, the only thing they
want is my money.

251
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,826
But those suitors began to get into strange
accidents one after another.

252
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,378
Luckily, all of them received
only minor injuries.

253
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,247
In the beginning, I thought of it
as divine retribution

254
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,874
and I didn't feel sorry for them at all.

255
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,885
But the accidents became more
and more serious,

256
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,820
and I was afraid that someone
would die soon.

257
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,391
So, I pretended to get married so
I could try to find the culprit.

258
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,329
I see. So, that's why you hired me.

259
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,664
Right, if the rumors are true,

260
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,201
then I figured you wouldn't be
killed by them so easily.

261
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,103
Well, they'll probably give up now.

262
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:36,268
After all, they now know that the
City Hunter is my husband.

263
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,579
You don't seem to realize how
valuable your fortune is.

264
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,740
The culprit won't give up so easily.

265
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,487
So, he's the target?

266
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,589
That's right. I want you to kill him.

267
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,825
I'll pay you whatever you want.

268
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,294
Do you know who he is?

269
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:59,064
I hear he's number one in the area.
Are you afraid too?

270
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,067
Hey, who do you think you're talking to?

271
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,303
If you're worried, go find someone else.

272
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:08,307
Sorry, I've heard that you're the
only one who could kill him.

273
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,104
Please accept the job.

274
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,580
Well, it's someone I'll have to get eventually.


275
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,216
There's only room for one
number one around here.

276
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,320
Yes, you're the true number one.
I'm counting on you.

277
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,810
I'll call you later.

278
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,129
What's with him? What a creep!

279
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,121
Falcon, are you really going to
accept that job?

280
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,981
Say, Miss Kanako, we still don't know
who the culprit is.

281
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,083
It's dangerous to be out in public so openly.

282
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:56,121
I'm safe, because the target
is Mr. Saeba, not me.

283
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,057
Well, that's true.

284
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,193
It's weird with things being different
from our usual jobs.

285
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:05,630
Forget about that, Miss Kaori. Let's dance
and cheer up some more!

286
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,666
I'm fine.

287
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,897
I'll keep you company! Come on, let's go!

288
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,768
Oh, little Kazama, did you
come to dance too?

289
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,380
You know what it means, don't you?
I challenge you to a duel.

290
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,984
Do you know whom you're challenging?

291
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,519
It doesn't matter who my opponent is.

292
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,148
If it's to make you my wife, I will
gladly throw away my life!

293
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,761
What's the time and place?

294
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,098
Midnight tomorrow, the Tokyo Bay landfill.

295
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,998
Be sure to come alone.

296
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:47,134
Perfect, and now, she'll be totally
taken with my manliness!

297
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,846
What's wrong? Moved by his
feelings for you?

298
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,541
Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,281
That old-fashioned attitude makes
him even more uncool.

300
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,618
I guess you really hate him, don't you?

301
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,431
Listen up. You better do the job that
you're paid to do this time.

302
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,334
But when our opponent is the City Hunter,

303
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,359
we fear for our lives.

304
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,406
Don't worry.

305
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,841
You guys alone would be hopeless,

306
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,077
so I hired a man named Umibozu.

307
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,877
Really?! Then I'm sure we'll succeed. Right?

308
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,653
I can't waste more time on this.


309
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,416
I have to settle this tonight.

310
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,899
Now, let's settle this already.

311
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,925
My mokkori with Kanako's waiting after this.

312
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,464
No need to rush things. Your opponent
will be that man.

313
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580
Miki, you're the witness.

314
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,547
Falcon...

315
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,285
On a date with Miki so late at night?

316
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,582
I'm sure that will cost you a pretty penny.

317
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,192
I was told that I'm the only one
who could take you on.

318
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,661
So now I have to prove it.

319
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,229
I see.

320
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,721
But I don't think they trust you
as much as you thought.

321
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,776
It's just like Saeba said.

322
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,471
There were some weird guys hiding out.

323
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,315
What's the meaning of this?

324
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,084
What? Well, it's kind of like insurance.

325
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,951
In other words, you don't trust me.

326
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,947
You've trampled on a pro's pride.

327
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,160
If you want to have him killed, do it yourself.

328
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,597
Wait a minute! There's no way
we can win without you!

329
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,866
I'll tell you one thing though.

330
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,235
This guy has no pride.

331
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,738
After all, he's allowed his gun
to be taken away.

332
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,037
Right now, even you guys might
have a chance at winning.

333
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,777
Hey, he doesn't have a gun!

334
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,404
Then maybe we can win!

335
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,351
Bastard, he didn't have to say that.

336
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:16,014
City Hunter, your head is mine!

337
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,027
What in the world did you just do?!

338
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,167
I don't need a gun against amateurs.


339
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,896
Pin balls are good enough!

340
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,336
Help! Don't kill us!

341
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,139
Hey, stop! Do what I paid you to do!

342
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,041
Goodbye!

343
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,743
Bastards!

344
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,574
Now, what will you do?

345
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,407
Why don't you forget about this stupid
duel and give up on Kanako?

346
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,416
I'll never give up!

347
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,087
Damn it! You won't get away with this!

348
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,622
Bastard!

349
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,601
Quit this futile struggle.

350
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,670
We already know that you
ordered the attacks

351
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,605
on the suitors who got close to Kanako.

352
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,241
Yes! I was behind those!

353
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,944
But that was because I love Kanako!

354
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,581
Isn't Kazama Industries actually having
huge financial difficulties

355
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,572
because your foreign investments failed?

356
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,447
How did you know that?

357
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,622
It's my job.


358
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,290
I had no choice.

359
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,660
If I don't marry her and obtain
the Date Group fortune,

360
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,628
Kazama Industries will go bankrupt.

361
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,933
So, you're after my money too.

362
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,436
But even though this duel was only
to draw my attention to you,

363
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,974
if you had fought honorably, my feelings
might have changed.

364
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,532
It's unfortunate.

365
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,779
My job is done here.
We're going home, Kaori!

366
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,246
Wait!

367
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,311
Say, won't you come on a
honeymoon with me now?

368
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,588
There's no need to pretend to be
newly married anymore.

369
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,791
No, I've really fallen in love with you!

370
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,560
Marry me for real!

371
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,329
Then the Date Group will be yours!

372
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,765
No thanks. It isn't my style.

373
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,702
Why? If you marry me, you can
live a life of luxury!

374
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,071
And as long as you live like that,

375
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,540
you won't encounter a real man.

376
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,909
You should have more confidence in yourself.

377
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,367
You're very attractive, even if you
have nothing but yourself.

378
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,758
"President of the Date Group,
Miss Kanako Date,"

379
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,694
"donates her entire fortune to
the welfare of society."

380
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,729
"Total value of forty billion yen!"

381
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,032
"Unprecedented, the largest
donation in history."

382
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,234
She sure has guts.

383
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,361
She probably found something more
important than money.

384
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,071
Too bad for you.

385
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,307
If you'd played it right, you'd have
landed in the lap of luxury.

386
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,409
I like mokkori better than money.

387
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,277
I like money.

388
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,881
Saeba, when are you going to pay us back?

389
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,316
Come on, give me a little more time.

390
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,342
Ryo, what did you do with
the pay we just got?!

391
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,180
I drank it.

392
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,888
Forgive me, Kaori!

393
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,663
Mr. Saeba!

394
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,065
Kanako!

395
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:17,736
I'm going to work hard from now on to attract
a wonderful person with my own charms.

396
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,439
Will you mokkori for me even when
I'm like this?

397
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,307
Of course!

398
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,143
Saeba! Pay us back!

399
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,701
Kane-chan, later!

400
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,314
Hi, Ryo. Want to get in?

401
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,441
Kaori, I love you!

402
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,317
You're so predictable.

403
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,220
Kaori, let me in! Kaori!
Flying through the sunrise

404
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:37,756
Saeba!

405
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:38,557
Saeba!
Searching for the sunset

406
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,257
Pay back your debt!
Searching for the sunset

407
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,088
Pay back your debt!

408
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:57,365
Changing the color of my lipstick
doesn't excite me anymore

409
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:02,811
Because its color is far from that of dreams

410
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:11,086
A journey to see a sunrise
like a ball of fire

411
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:16,528
If I could invite you too

412
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:25,835
I would take to the sky like a feather

413
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:34,079
If I can become passionate,
that's all I want

414
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:42,418
An invisible sun will surely rise in my heart

415
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:50,385
I want to gaze upon something grand

416
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:56,902
Even my bit of courage goes barefoot

417
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:02,033
And runs away

418
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,481
A cute girl like that wants to
learn how to use a gun?!

419
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,383
She might not look like it, but Miss Aiko's
a detective, you know.

420
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,352
She said that the moment she began her first
case, someone started trying to kill her.

421
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,054
I guess she's on a really dangerous case.

422
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,423
No, actually, she's looking for a lost dog.

423
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,059
A dog?! This beats all!
A gun to search for a dog!

424
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,062
It isn't funny! There really is
someone out to kill her.

425
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,197
City Hunter 3:

426
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,933
"Dangerous Detective Game!
A Python for the Lady (Part 1)"

427
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,560
It'll be dangerous not to watch.
