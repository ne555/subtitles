1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,608
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
One can a day
Careful, don't drink too much!
Hi
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,482
Frustration comes knocking on my door

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,319
Wolves that can't run

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,156
Wander around, clawing at the darkness

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,455
The last time I saw you

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
Was in the dusty crowds

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,401
Your accusing gaze

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,667
Left an ache in my back as I walked away

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,877
The roadway has been blocked by fog

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,680
Even now, I'm still looking for the answer

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,446
In the clueless night sky

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,388
The horizon stretches out

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, a sky
without constellations

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, a path
without common sense

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,244
Wow, wow, wow, seeking only kindness

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,907
Wow, wow, wow, facing loneliness

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,075
Wow, wow, wow, I don't need you like that

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,297
Miss Aiko Kamimura runs a
detective agency, right?

29
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,932
What kind of job does she want us to do?

30
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,301
She says she wants to learn
how to use a gun.

31
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,703
Is the job she accepted that dangerous?

32
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,938
She's looking for a lost dog.

33
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,242
Oh, man! Why does she need a gun
for a job like that?

34
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,545
Apparently, there are some guys
following her around.

35
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,949
But that was Miss Aiko's uncle,
who's worried about her, right?

36
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,076
No, this time, her uncle was
the one that got attacked.

37
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,120
Then...

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,080
Dangerous Detective Game!
A Python for the Lady
(Part Two)

39
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:16,664
The Kamimura Detective Agency is in
such a wonderful environment!

40
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,643
I can peek all I want! Watch all I want!

41
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,541
Divine Retribution

42
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,351
Kamimura Detective Agency
Wall-creep exterminated.

43
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:31,976
Kamimura Detective Agency

44
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,661
Say, Aiko, I'm not saying this because
I'm afraid for myself.

45
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,564
A leg or two is nothing if it's for you.

46
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,868
Rather, I can't help but worry about
you, working as a detective.

47
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,462
I can't let you go through what I am!

48
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:56,974
Uncle, you care for me that much, even
after what I put you through?

49
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,514
Of course. Now that my younger brother
has passed away,

50
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,314
I think of you as my own child, since
I don't have any of my own.

51
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:16,296
I can't make my kind uncle suffer
any more than he already has.

52
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,560
All because of my silly, spoiled ways...

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,467
Uncle, I'll quit!

54
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,613
I wonder what it could be? Hello?


55
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,815
Yes? Oh, Mr. Saeba?

56
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,409
You found the dog?!

57
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,822
Uncle, he said he's already brought
the dog to the office.

58
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,125
He's called the owner and they're coming
to pick him up tomorrow.

59
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,494
I'm so glad. Now that the dog's been found,

60
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,463
there's no reason for you to be
targeted anymore!

61
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,862
But...

62
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,669
I have to hurry. Take care!

63
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,330
I'll come again tomorrow.

64
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,840
Ai!

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,707
Kamimura Detective Agency

66
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,314
Just a little bit further...

67
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,420
The dog will be handed over
to the owner tomorrow.

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,115
Tonight's my only chance.

69
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,861
Damn it!

70
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,935
Welcome.

71
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,269
I'm amazed that you could climb this far
with a broken leg, Uncle.

72
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,437
You!

73
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,914
What?! The dog hasn't been found yet?!

74
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,916
You tricked me!

75
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:48,554
We're even. You tricked us about your
broken leg too. Remember?

76
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,421
I found this in the bushes outside.

77
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,829
Uncle, why did you do this?

78
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,606
I've got other evidence too.

79
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,631
Do you want me to tell her?

80
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,177
That's right. I did it.

81
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,271
I tore down the posters and hindered
the search for the dog.

82
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,883
I faked getting hit by the car too, but...

83
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:26,159
But I did it all to make my dear Aiko
quit such dangerous work.

84
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,493
That's why... That's why I put on
this monkey show and...

85
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,440
Please don't cry. I was wrong.

86
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,042
I didn't realize how much you cared for me,

87
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,011
and I acted so spoiled.

88
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,478
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,306
Good! Then you'll quit being a detective?

90
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,422
Now that that's decided, let's hurry
and dispose of this office.

91
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,557
That's a good idea!

92
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,561
Then you can build a big hotel here,
right, Uncle?

93
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,898
That's right! I own the buildings on
both sides of this place too.

94
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,736
If I can take this land and turn it all
into one luxurious hotel,

95
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,533
then I can make a lot more money...

96
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,073
How did you know about that?

97
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,979
I heard that you were in the
real estate business.

98
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,281
So, I looked into things a bit.

99
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,917
Uncle! I can't believe this!

100
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,852
You were going to turn Father's
precious agency into a hotel?!

101
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,056
Yes, but...

102
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:35,161
But it's true that I care about you too.
Please believe me, Aiko.

103
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,528
Well, why don't you forgive
him already, Aiko?

104
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:43,302
But I do think you went a little too far with
phone threats and things like that,

105
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,270
just to make her quit being a detective.

106
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,207
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?

107
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,233
I don't know anything about cars or
threatening phone calls!

108
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,855
Aiko, you're being targeted
by someone after all!

109
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,491
Quit this dangerous search for the dog!

110
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,427
You're not fit to be a detective!

111
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,329
Please, enough is enough!
You're just lying again!

112
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,964
I can't trust you anymore!

113
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,333
You won't stop at anything to
build that hotel, will you?

114
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,800
Aiko!

115
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,304
Go home! I don't want to
talk to you anymore!

116
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,789
I don't think he was necessarily lying.

117
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,661
But then, who? Why would anyone
interfere with a search for a dog?

118
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,763
It means that there's someone

119
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,926
who wants to get their hands on the dog
before Ai or the owners.

120
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:53,573
Anyway, you didn't drag me way out here
for nothing, right?

121
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,008
Oh, that's right. When I went to the
station this morning,

122
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,077
there was a job for us on the message board.

123
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:02,148
What?! You're going to make me
do two jobs at once?!

124
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,851
Meanie! Demon! Miser! Skinflint!

125
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:09,055
Never mind! Just take a good look
at the client's name.

126
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,790
I will be waiting on the roof
of the Kamimura Building.
Koichiro Kamimura

127
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,493
I will be waiting on the roof
of the Kamimura Building.
Koichiro Kamimura
This is Ai's uncle.

128
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,794
I will be waiting on the roof
of the Kamimura Building.
Koichiro Kamimura
That's right.

129
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,992
I will be waiting on the roof
of the Kamimura Building.
Koichiro Kamimura
Come to think of it, he doesn't know
that you're the City Hunter.

130
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:28,374
What?! You're City Hunter?!

131
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,775
Well, I'm not surprised that
you don't believe it.

132
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,804
Anyway, you probably don't like me,
so I'll be going.

133
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,252
Wait!

134
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,687
Please protect Aiko.


135
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,291
There really is someone after her.

136
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,893
Please, I'm begging you.

137
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,428
She won't believe anything I say anymore.

138
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,226
This is the best I can do for her now.

139
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,929
I'm begging you! Please protect Aiko!

140
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,105
If that's the job, then you don't
need to hire me, Mister.

141
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,973
I've already begun to guard Aiko
on my own discretion.

142
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,581
Oh, and one more thing.

143
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,484
I haven't helped in her search
for the dog so far,

144
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,315
and I won't help her from now on either.

145
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:18,352
After all, that's a bet that's just
between you and Aiko.

146
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,534
That man...

147
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,372
I see. My uncle did that?

148
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,982
But Mr. Saeba, I don't need you to guard me.

149
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,620
Because accepting it would mean
accepting help in my search.

150
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,690
I want to win the bet that I made
with my uncle fairly.

151
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,425
But that's dangerous.

152
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,161
I see. Then good luck on your own.

153
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,628
Ryo!

154
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:01,667
But instead, take this with you
in case of an emergency.

155
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,501
Here!

156
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,070
What is this?

157
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,605
A charm to protect you from evil.

158
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,908
Open it when you think you're done for.

159
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,773
It should come in handy.

160
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,311
Okay!

161
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,350
Really, thank you very much.

162
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,080
Well, I should get back to
searching for the dog.

163
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,988
Wish me luck!

164
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,093
How admirable.

165
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,195
I feel bad for her uncle,

166
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,165
but seeing her like that makes me
want to help her.

167
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,434
By the way, how did it go?

168
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,203
It was such a pain in the butt!

169
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:41,607
After all, I sent that poster to all the veterinary
clinics in the city by express mail.

170
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,842
Let's see.

171
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,011
Here, the receipt for making the
copies and mailing them.

172
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,706
What?! This much?!

173
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,087
Hello, Kamimura Detective Agency.

174
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,659
What?! The dog is over there?!

175
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,562
Sasaki Veterinary Clinic
Yes, I took in an injured dog
about a week ago.

176
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,528
Yes, I was trying to find his owner
and I saw this poster.

177
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,529
All right!

178
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,967
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll come to pick
him up right away. Okay!

179
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:23,315
As you requested, I didn't
mention you, Mr. Saeba.

180
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,274
Thank you, Doctor. I've got
my reasons, you see.

181
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,156
You've sure caused a lot of trouble.

182
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,714
But still...

183
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,460
What a stupid looking dog.

184
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,054
What's scary is that he looks even
stupider than this drawing.

185
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,833
It'll be great to get him off my hands too.

186
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,704
He goes around prying open the
cages of my female patients.

187
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,331
He's such a mokkori dog.

188
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,033
That hits a little too close to home.

189
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,211
By the way, this dog's injury...

190
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,114
You think that it might be a gunshot wound?

191
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:59,448
Yes, but it's only a scratch, so
it's hard to say for sure.

192
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,333
She sure left looking happy.
You think she found the dog?

193
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,435
If so, we've got no choice.

194
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,767
All we care about is getting that dog.

195
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,742
Sasaki Veterinary Clinic

196
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,857
Thank you very much, Doctor.

197
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,724
Not at all, I hope he gets better soon.

198
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,365
I'm glad that I finally found him, but...

199
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,697
What's with this dog? I don't think
he just likes female dogs.

200
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,361
Good grief, at this rate, it's
just like being with him.

201
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,189
Oh, Ryo, I found it.

202
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,390
Exactly one week ago,

203
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,627
three men robbed a branch of
the Kitahara Bank.

204
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,796
That same night, they got into a fight
and weapons were fired.


205
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,531
They say that one of them
is in critical condition.

206
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,556
All right, that's it.

207
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,874
What's wrong?

208
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,578
Looks like we've finally found him.

209
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,775
Well, I guess it's okay if we think of it
as you having saved us the trouble.

210
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,919
Please let me go. Who are you?!

211
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,723
We've got business with that dog!

212
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,826
You're coming with us too, Lady!

213
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,386
All you have to do is come quietly with us.

214
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,568
Owowow! My leg! My leg!

215
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,728
Damn! After them!

216
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,971
Who are those people? They have guns!

217
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:09,210
I see. They're the ones who were
interfering with my search!

218
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,377
Aiko!

219
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,027
Damn it! Where'd they go?!

220
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,120
They're quick little bastards!

221
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,532
Do Not Enter

222
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,299
There they are.

223
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,588
I'm sure we've cornered them.

224
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,423
There's nowhere else that
they could be hiding.

225
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,586
Hey! Hiding's useless! Come on out!

226
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:04,403
What should I do? At this rate,
they'll eventually find us.

227
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,305
I know! I have the charm that
Mr. Saeba gave me!

228
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,470
This must be the kind of situation
I should open it in.

229
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,482
Contains Brandy

230
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,973
Whisky Bon-Bon
What is this?

231
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,186
What's this mean?

232
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,178
Am I supposed to eat this to
calm down or something?!

233
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,352
There you are. Come on out!

234
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,629
I don't care what happens anymore!

235
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,740
All right, if you won't come out,
we're coming to get you!

236
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,043
We'll drag you out of there!

237
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,477
Shut yer frickin' mouths!

238
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,616
Damn!

239
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,422
That Saeba bastard gave me
only one whisky bon-bon!

240
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,957
What a cheap bastard!

241
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,857
Hey, you sissies!

242
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,625
If you've got some, you'd better
hand 'em over, or else!

243
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,506
Hey, what's with that girl?
It looks like she's drunk.

244
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,843
Her eyes look dimmed. Is she
really the same girl?

245
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,913
What're you blitherin' about?!

246
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,549
Huwwy up and hand over
the whisky bon-bons!

247
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,585
Don't mess with us! Who cares
about whisky bon-bons!

248
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,821
You'd better hand over the dog fast!

249
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,422
What d'you say?!

250
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:34,193
You'd wather give it to the dog than to me?!

251
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,751
You won't get away with that!

252
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,781
I fell down too!

253
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,821
Hey, you okay?

254
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,895
Damn it, that little bitch.

255
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,663
What?!

256
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,299
Hey, don't move.

257
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,928
I might not look it, but I'm a sharpshooter.

258
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,774
A sharpshooter?

259
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,743
You couldn't hit anything wobbling
around like that!

260
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,941
All wight, then I'll show ya what I can do.

261
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,452
In other words, I'll aim at the
steel ceiling beam and...

262
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:42,124
I have a feeling that I might be wasting
a great deal of my time.

263
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,799
Hey, mutt, quit scurrying around.
You'll get into trouble.

264
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,882
That's impossible!

265
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,054
How 'bout it? It's called the
Wicochet Two Stage Shot!

266
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,156
Next, I'll aim at your gun...

267
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:16,025
Don't get cocky! That was luck!
You won't make it again!

268
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,823
Take that!

269
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,628
Here's an extra one.

270
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,208
This can't be happening...

271
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,548
How 'bout it? Give up now?

272
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,917
After all, I'm the invincible woman detective!

273
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,419
Damn!


274
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,052
That bitch, messing with us...

275
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,524
Never mind, just stay asleep a while longer.

276
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:02,165
But that's stwange. I only shot twice,
but the gunshots...

277
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,539
Oh, well!

278
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,718
Bank robbers? Those men
were bank robbers?!

279
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,355
Yes, the third member betrayed them

280
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,891
and tried to keep the money for himself.

281
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:24,557
He hid the key to the safe on a dog
that happened to wander by.

282
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,945
They were looking for the dog,
using that wound as a clue.

283
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:44,616
So, they thought it'd get complicated
if Ai found him first.

284
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,051
I can't believe it.

285
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,922
How did I beat such people by myself?

286
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,790
I don't remember anything.

287
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,054
Nana!

288
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,265
Dummy, where've you been?!

289
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,257
Oh, I'm so glad!

290
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:14,046
Mr. Saeba, I think I sort of know
how my father used to feel.

291
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,250
Why my father worked so hard as
an unprofitable detective.

292
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,084
Why my father's eyes used to sparkle so.

293
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,455
There's one other thing that you've gained.

294
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,784
You now have the same sparkling eyes
that your father had.

295
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,169
Mr. Saeba...

296
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,717
Wow!

297
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,224
You sure you guys aren't actually brothers?!

298
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,385
Your behavioral patterns are
exactly the same!

299
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,361
Kamimura Detective Agency

300
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,733
You're going to quit being a detective?

301
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,430
Why, Aiko? You won our bet.

302
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,440
No, I was able to solve the case because
I had Mr. Saeba's help.

303
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,875
Miss Aiko...

304
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,003
What are you saying? You solved
this on your own.

305
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,914
I can tell.

306
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,217
I'm sure that Mr. Saeba was
behind the scenes

307
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,753
helping me find the dog and
beating the robbers.

308
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,955
Then this office...

309
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,992
But that doesn't mean I'll let you
turn it into a hotel, Uncle!

310
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,296
Oh, I've given up on that already,

311
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,389
ever since you got mad at me.

312
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:45,337
Anyway, I know now I don't have
what it takes to be a detective.

313
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,397
But I could be an assistant.

314
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,305
I have a bad feeling about this.

315
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,150
Mr. Saeba, please make me your assistant!

316
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,019
Please! Forever, if possible!

317
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,422
Wait a minute, Aiko.

318
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,855
Aiko!

319
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,763
Then how about making this place into
an office for the two of you?

320
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,132
Uncle!

321
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,602
Hey, now!

322
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,040
Saeba, I like you.

323
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,644
Please take care of Aiko, and also...

324
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,713
See? Take a look at this diagram.

325
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:32,275
This way, my hotel will be big and the
detective office will still stand.

326
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,686
So, what do you think?

327
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,656
Don't you think you could peek into
the hotel windows easily?

328
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,858
Yeah! And maybe holes in the ceilings!

329
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,292
Super Big
Yeah! And maybe holes in the ceilings!

330
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,894
Super Big
Oh, wait! How about a connecting
corridor instead?

331
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,465
Super Big
Right? That's a much more convenient,
much better idea!

332
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,932
Super Big

333
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:57,499
Changing the color of my lipstick
doesn't excite me anymore

334
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:02,944
Because its color is far from that of dreams

335
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:11,220
A journey to see a sunrise
like a ball of fire

336
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:16,661
If I could invite you too

337
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:25,968
I would take to the sky like a feather

338
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:34,212
If I can become passionate,
that's all I want

339
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:42,551
An invisible sun will surely rise in my heart

340
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:50,518
I want to gaze upon something grand

341
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:57,035
Even my bit of courage goes barefoot

342
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:02,166
And runs away

343
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,448
Miki's going to marry the Samonji family boy.


344
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,549
Talk about the lap of luxury!

345
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,651
There's no way Umibozu will
allow that to happen!

346
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,186
He said, "It's got nothing to do with me."

347
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,554
But that can't be!

348
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,056
This might be my chance to make Miki mine!

349
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,291
All right, I'm going to go save her!


350
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,160
Hold on a minute! Oh, men!

351
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,796
None of you understand how a woman feels!

352
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,064
City Hunter 3:

353
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,201
"Stubborn Umibozu!
Tale of the Jealous Kitten"

354
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,998
I'll make you mine, if you don't watch!
