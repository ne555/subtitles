Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, seiza no kieta sora

00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, joushiki no nai michi

Wow, wow, wow, sonna kimi wa iranai

28
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,530
Looks like you stuck your nose
in too far, Mr. Detective.

29
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,070
You've got nowhere left to run now.
Give it up!

30
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,445
Do you think so?

31
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,116
You bastards think you can hit me?

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,277
What?! Finish him!

33
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,753
No way.

34
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,796
Looks like you underestimated me.

35
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,565
He's so cool!

36
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,873
You bastards think you can hit me?

37
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,343
Bang! Bang, bang!

38
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,871
Looks like you underestimated me.

39
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,288
Please! Just a little bit!

40
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,157
No means no!

41
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,426
I just want to examine it a little!
I won't fire it or anything!

42
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,494
You sure as hell won't!

43
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,986
Please! I just want to get one
good look at a real gun!

44
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,233
If you keep at it,

45
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,701
I'll arrest you on the charge of
hindering a public official!

46
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,673
Arrest me?! That's so cool!

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,874
Hey, try and arrest me!

48
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,043
Wow, real handcuffs! Lemme see!
Lemme see!

49
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,840
I don't wanna deal with her!

50
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:04,372
Who the Heck is Ryo?
Even the College Girl is
Smitten with the Thrill

51
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,583
Say, Miss?

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,288
Won't you keep me company for
a full course of mokkori?

53
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,565
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,839
Let's see, my next target will be...

55
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,775
Oh, shoot!

56
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,445
Oh, my, really?

57
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,276
You're so lucky.

58
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,646
Safe... If she finds me, she'll make me
pass out fliers again.

59
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,979
Kaori's walking with a man?!

60
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,527
Is something wrong?

61
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,587
Oh, no, must be my imagination.
Shall we go?

62
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,800
Where is she going?

63
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,906
The way he moves! That look in his eyes!

64
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,373
He's not just anybody!

65
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,114
If you go straight ahead about
three hundred meters,

66
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,651
there's a dark colored building
to your left. That's the one.

67
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,621
Thank you for your trouble.
You've been a great help.

68
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,355
You're welcome.

69
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,022
Goodbye.

70
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,489
Bye.

71
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,194
Giving directions...

72
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,231
I get it. I get it.

73
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,933
Mister, you're a detective, aren't you?

74
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,400
Yeah!

75
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,398
You scared me!

76
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,436
A mokkori gal!

77
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,081
May I help you?

78
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,174
Don't you need to keep tailing that person?

79
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,145
Is there anything that I can help with?

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,789
Who are you?

81
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,816
I'm Hitomi Takano, nineteen years of age.
I'm a college student!

82
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,195
A mokkori college student!

83
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,624
My name is Ryo Saeba. I've been
waiting for someone like you.

84
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:08,007
Please, let me be your assistant!
I just adore detectives!

85
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,999
I'll do anything! Please, Sensei!

86
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,579
Sensei?

87
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,682
All right, I understand.

88
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,985
I don't generally accept assistants,

89
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,254
but I'll make an exception and
take you on as one.

90
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,449
Wow! Thank you very much!

91
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,959
But the training will be tough!

92
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,359
Yes! I'll work hard, Sensei!

93
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:35,334
To become a detective, you must
first look the part.

94
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,774
I need to wear a skirt this short?

95
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:47,580
Mr. Saeba, I think miniskirts generally
hinder movement.

96
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,117
My dear Hitomi, that is an
amateur's way of thinking.

97
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,711
The work of a detective involves
a lot of danger.

98
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,789
And in general, the enemy is male.

99
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,955
And the male's weakness is a miniskirt!

100
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,091
What? I don't really understand.

101
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:11,771
Oh, I see! So this is how you beat
them up. Right, Sensei?

102
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,831
Very good.

103
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,807
Well, is this part of a detective's
costume too?

104
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,982
How strange. You only changed your clothes

105
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,451
and you already look like a
respectable detective.

106
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,620
Awesome!

107
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,656
Now I finally get to do detective work!

108
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,092
Not so fast! There's still the
intensive training left!

109
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,719
What? Intensive training?

110
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,063
Hello.

111
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,064
Welcome.

112
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,265
Has Ryo come by?

113
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,867
I haven't seen him today.

114
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,935
He ran away after all!

115
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,237
Is something wrong?

116
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,706
We were supposed to pass out
fliers this afternoon,

117
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,038
but when I looked around, I couldn't
find him anywhere.

118
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,310
That sounds just like Saeba.

119
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,712
Oh, thank you.

120
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,414
It isn't funny.

121
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,473
I'm always the one that gets stuck
with the hard work.

122
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,485
Where's Umibozu?

123
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,921
He went to a nearby bank
to exchange money.

124
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,425
Wow, I didn't know Umibozu did
things like that for you too.

125
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,052
You'd never know it by looking at him.

126
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:09,925
Welcome.

127
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,944
Hi!

128
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,046
Could it be? He's a bank robber!

129
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,414
Wait! No!

130
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,784
Someone! It's a bank robber!

131
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,808
Catch him!

132
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,551
No, I just came to exchange money...

133
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,294
No! He's my friend!

134
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,855
What?! He's not a bank robber?!
What'll I do?!

135
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,467
We've got no choice. Last resort plan!

136
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,263
Yes, Sir!

137
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,469
Run!

138
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,596
Damn you! I won't forget this, Ryo!

139
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,010
Sensei, I can't run any further!

140
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,612
What's this?

141
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,949
You'll never be a detective
if you tire so easily.

142
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:08,054
Physical strength is essential to a detective!

143
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,487
Yes, Sir.

144
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,526
He was with a girl in a miniskirt?!

145
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:18,429
At that rate, they're probably making out and
getting mokkori in the park right about now.

146
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:22,998
I'll never forgive that Mr. Mokkori!

147
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,672
I wonder if Saeba will survive?

148
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,635
He brought this down on himself.

149
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,680
Now, intensive training number one!

150
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,841
Let's try sit-ups.

151
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,121
Sensei, you don't have any ulterior
motives to peek, do you?

152
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,557
Of course not! I'll sit with
my back to you, okay?

153
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,160
One...

154
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,363
Two...

155
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,532
Three...

156
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,500
Four...

157
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,964
Five...

158
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,337
Six...

159
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,007
Six...
The mokkori's right behind me,
but I'm at a bad angle!

160
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,208
Seven...
The mokkori's right behind me,
but I'm at a bad angle!

161
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:02,808
Seven...

162
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,776
I can't stand it anymore!

163
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,378
Eight...
I can't stand it anymore!

164
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,675
Eight...

165
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,282
Nine...

166
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,749
Woo-hoo!

167
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,846
Are you okay, Sensei?

168
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,817
Your kicking power's not bad.

169
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,726
Intensive training number two!

170
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,896
Mr. Saeba, is it time yet?!

171
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,296
You can do it! Thirty seconds to go!

172
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,237
Those mokkori thighs are very
nice at close range.

173
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,340
Oh, I can't hold on anymore!

174
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,366
If it's too hard, I'll hold you up.

175
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,413
What're you doing, you idiot?!

176
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,647
Scary!

177
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,978
That's it!

178
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,519
Oh, my.

179
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,922
It hurts, but I'm happy.

180
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,930
We don't have any work! You think you
can keep two assistants?!

181
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,799
Well? What do you have to say
for yourself, Ryo?!

182
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,667
Ow, ow, I'm against violence!

183
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,603
It hurts! It hurts! Let go!
Please stop, Sempai!

184
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,870
It hurts! It hurts! Let go!
Sempai?

185
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,838
It hurts! It hurts! Let go!
I'm to blame.

186
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,743
I just adore detectives, so I pushed
Mr. Saeba to let me...

187
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,245
I don't care if I'm an assistant or not,

188
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,581
just please let me make myself useful!

189
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,350
Please, Sempai!

190
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,554
Well... Sempai, you say...
What should I do?

191
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,921
Well, I guess you can stay as an apprentice.

192
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,270
Wow! A real gun!

193
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,877
Quick bastard.

194
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,277
Ryo, who was it meant for?

195
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,731
What?! I get to stay here?!

196
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,699
Right!

197
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:11,170
Until we know who the culprit is,
we can't let you be by yourself.

198
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,607
And if you're here, I can
protect you properly.

199
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,643
You're going to protect me?

200
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,711
That's right,

201
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,181
because an unexpected evil
might come after you.

202
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,207
Wow, this is so exciting!

203
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,726
Hello.

204
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,561
Oh, welcome, Saeko.

205
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,028
Doing some cleaning?

206
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,899
Ryo's out right now.

207
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,269
I was passing close to here,
so I just dropped by.

208
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,603
Is Ryo out working?

209
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,372
Yeah, sort of.

210
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,805
Did something happen?

211
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,741
It's nothing big, but just now, at the park...

212
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,720
How can it be this much for just
toiletries and clothing?

213
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,622
Well, this conflict might be
prolonged, you know?

214
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,291
I brought ten days' worth of clothing.

215
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,849
Ten days' worth?!

216
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,731
Wait, that means there are ten days'
worth of underwear!

217
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,599
Counting both top and bottom,

218
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,502
there are twenty articles of college girl
underwear in here!

219
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,471
That one has my textbooks and pillow in it.

220
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,346
Bro, let's get this over with already.

221
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,848
No, let's not.

222
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,408
It might get troublesome with
that guy around.

223
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,816
Let's watch how things go for a bit longer.

224
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,626
This is called a Mini Cooper, right?

225
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,995
Yeah, how did you know?

226
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,165
I like cute cars.

227
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,226
The other day, I bought a used Subaru,
but I got into an accident.

228
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,442
What's wrong? Are you worried?

229
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,208
Who are you really, Mr. Saeba?

230
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,416
There's no way a normal detective
would have a gun.

231
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,652
But then, you don't look like a
police detective either.

232
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,712
Maybe I'm a killer for hire.

233
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,818
Yes, you have that dangerous
scent about you.

234
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,284
Do you not like a dangerous scent?

235
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,994
No way! I love it!

236
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,235
And which park is this?

237
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,072
It's the park near Mitsuboshi Bank. Why?

238
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,141
Oh, just wondering.


239
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,473
Well, I think I'll be going home now.

240
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,347
Bye, say hi to Ryo for me.

241
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,871
Okay, bye.

242
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,951
I wonder what she came here for?

243
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,030
Say, is there anything I can do to help?

244
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,465
Don't worry about it.

245
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,102
Oh, could you go get Ryo soon?
I think he's in the basement.

246
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,228
Okay!

247
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,657
That serious expression isn't like the
Mr. Saeba I've known so far.

248
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,567
Hitomi, welcome!

249
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,001
It's his usual expression.

250
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,037
Here.

251
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,042
It's heavy. It really feels solid.

252
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,143
You want to try firing it?

253
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,634
What?! May I?!

254
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,914
All right!

255
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,852
It's saved my life many times over.

256
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,520
But...

257
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,989
But?

258
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,719
I've hurt just as many people with it.

259
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,926
That is the way of guns.

260
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,459
I don't think I can fire it.

261
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,105
Because I don't think I can bear
the weight of the real thing.

262
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,508
I see.

263
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,076
Who's there? Ryo?

264
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,881
Who are you people?!

265
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,792
You stay here!

266
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,384
What?! Mr. Saeba!

267
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,146
Now, stay quiet!

268
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,587
I'll save Miss Kaori!

269
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,766
Mr. Saeba, get in!

270
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,402
Can you do this?

271
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,369
You can count on me!

272
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,146
I did it again.

273
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,443
Now, look here...

274
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,651
We were this close to saving her!

275
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,688
If something happens to Miss Kaori,
it'll be my fault!

276
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,757
There's no need to worry about that.

277
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,520
The one they're after isn't Kaori.

278
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,662
If they were after Kaori from the beginning,

279
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,064
they would have killed her on the spot.

280
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,067
Then, the one they're after is...

281
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,558
You or me, it seems.

282
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,369
Did you see their faces?

283
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,885
It can't be!

284
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,221
Looks like you just remembered something.

285
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,924
But they want to kill me,
just for hitting them?

286
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,152
Hitting them?

287
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,466
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

288
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,899
Damn! Just go!

289
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,608
It was my fault, so I was going
to pay for the damages,

290
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,906
but they drove off in a hurry,
as if they were on the run.

291
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,913
One of the guys who kidnapped
Miss Kaori was the guy I hit.

292
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,716
Speak of the Devil.

293
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,760
That's right.

294
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,365
I want to trade your partner for the girl there.

295
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,902
Don't do anything funny if you
value your partner's life.

296
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,767
Yeah, got it.

297
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,045
The outside's set.

298
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,572
All right, then all we have to do
is lure them inside.

299
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,754
It's an old rule of thumb: Kill all witnesses.

300
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,556
Don't hold it against us.

301
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,258
We went to a lot of trouble to
get hold of a gun.

302
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,285
It'll be pointless if we don't see
a profit from it after all.

303
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,964
You didn't have to go wear Kaori's
battle getup, you know.

304
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:31,043
Wearing this makes me feel like I can
feel Kaori Sempai's courage.

305
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,947
Because Sempai was kidnapped
in place of me!

306
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,608
I don't really get the reasoning.

307
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,334
Miss Kaori!

308
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,801
Wait! Hitomi!

309
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,545
If we don't hurry up and get out
of here, we're barbeque!

310
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,758
Ryo!

311
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,696
There's just one way.

312
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,756
Hitomi, please. Do this for us.

313
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,997
Please take off your trousers.

314
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,139
Hey! Get serious!

315
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,632
It was a joke!

316
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,047
Did you bring this?

317
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,083
Yes, I brought it along with these clothes.

318
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,550
What is it?

319
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,014
Let's hurry up and get outta here.

320
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,526
What the?

321
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,908
Damn it.

322
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,875
Die!

323
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,210
Bastard!

324
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,089
Damn you!

325
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,633
Hi, Ryo. Long time no see.

326
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,100
Saeko!

327
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,039
This gun was actually stolen from the police.

328
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,169
I'm glad we recovered it before
the media got wind of it.

329
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,774
What's going on here, Saeko?

330
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:53,385
I heard that you'd been shot at in the park,

331
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,684
so, just to be safe, I checked
the markings of the bullet.

332
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,324
And it turned out that it matched
the stolen gun.

333
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,827
All we had was the getaway vehicle that
had been hit and abandoned,

334
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,763
so I was in a real bind without any
other clues to go on.

335
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,232
The vehicle that had been hit...

336
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,565
I see, so these guys are the perpetrators.

337
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,704
Exactly, and you know the rest.

338
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,776
Wow! Awesome!

339
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,153
Oh, how cool!

340
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,894
Perfect.

341
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,862
Please, would you tell me your name?

342
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm Saeko Nogami from police headquarters.
Nice to meet you.

343
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,003
Well, I'm Hitomi Takano,
nineteen years of age.

344
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,040
I've always adored female police detectives!

345
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,838
Please, make me your assistant!

346
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,546
Ryo, are you here?

347
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,520
I've properly taught everything to Miss
Hitomi, so I'll leave the rest to you.

348
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,259
You didn't happen to teach her how to
manipulate men, did you?

349
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,628
Oh, my, I would never.

350
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,996
Then what did you...

351
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,463
Mr. Saeba...

352
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,699
Mokkori thighs!

353
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,196
First lesson in self-defense!

354
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,106
Second lesson!

355
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,165
Take that!

356
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,051
That's dangerous!

357
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,220
That's strange. I was sure
I had aimed to miss.
Flying through the sunrise

358
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,887
That's strange. I was sure
I had aimed to miss.

359
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:36,888
I guess I need more training.
I'd better work at that!

360
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,288
I guess I need more training.
I'd better work at that!
Searching for the sunset

361
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:56,597
Mou kuchibeni kaete mo tokimekanai no yo

362
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:02,044
Yume no iro ni wa toui kara

363
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:10,319
Hi no tama no you na asahi o mini iku tabi e

364
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:15,761
Moshi anata mo sasoetara

365
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:25,068
Hane no you ni maiagaruwa sora e

366
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:33,311
Atsuku naretara sore de ii

367
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:41,650
Kono mune ni kitto mienai hi ga noboru

368
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:49,617
Ookina mono o mitsumetai

369
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:56,134
Chiiisana tsuyogari mo hadashi no mama

370
00:23:56,134 --> 00:24:01,265
Nigete yuku yo

371
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,147
Oh, rain, rain, come again. Kei will...

372
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,449
Head in the clouds, as always.

373
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,318
Well, the client is a mokkori
weather girl after all!

374
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,353
The ever more popular Miss
Kei Amamiya, right?

375
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,756
I, the greatest sunshine guy in Japan,

376
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,659
will blow away any man who
dares threaten her!

377
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,991
Would you blow away our debts too
while you're at it?

378
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,930
City Hunter 3:

379
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,767
