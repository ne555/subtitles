Break away from yesterday

Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, seiza no kieta sora

00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507

Wow, wow, wow, sonna kimi wa iranai

28
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,595
Hello, Miki, Kasumi.

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,825
Oh, hello, Kaori.

30
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,266
Hot coffee please.

31
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,164
Sure!

32
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,505
A cat!

33
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,941
Isn't she cute? Her name's Taki.

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,411
We borrowed the name of the cat
that Raymond Chandler kept.

35
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,244
Taki? She's cute!

36
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,916
But I thought Umibozu hated cats.

37
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,255
Well, she was abandoned behind the shop.

38
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,815
To someone who loves cats,
please take her in.
I couldn't just leave her there, you know?

39
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,393
Looks like her previous owners
were good to her.

40
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,295
She's so chubby.

41
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,564
But does Umibozu know about this?

42
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,431
Falcon's out shopping right now.

43
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,928
Wow, Umibozu goes shopping for you?

44
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,451
You're lucky that he's so nice.

45
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,477
It'd be pointless even hoping for Ryo
to do something like that.

46
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,948
What's wrong?

47
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,116
Umibozu!

48
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:17,085
Stubborn Umibozu!
Tale of the Jealous Kitten

49
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,765
You're going to keep it?!

50
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,301
But I feel sorry for it.

51
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,469
Anything but that!

52
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,472
She's so cute. Are you really
that afraid of her?

53
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,443
I absolutely hate that weak look,
form and cry!

54
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,312
It drains the strength from me.

55
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,813
How exaggerated.

56
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,083
As a sweeper, you have a fearsome
reputation in the underworld.

57
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,177
You'll become a laughingstock if they
ever learn that you fear cats.

58
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,024
They can laugh all they want.
Cats are my natural enemy.

59
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,924
Oh, you're not a mouse, you know.

60
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,658
It's here! Go away! Please, do something!

61
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,309
I can't believe Falcon!

62
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,344
Did you have a fight?

63
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,012
He got mad and left!

64
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,946
He said he's not coming back
until I get rid of the cat!

65
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,519
Damn! Why does this have to happen?!

66
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,096
You know, a sweeper having a weakness
such as a fear of cats

67
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,831
could find it really getting in
the way of his work.

68
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,028
Well, the way he looks, I guess
it is a problem.

69
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,671
I'd really like to fix his opinion about this.

70
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,208
That means your taste in men
has changed, right?

71
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,076
There's no way a woman like you is a
good match for that octopus-brain.

72
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,148
I'm glad you realized that
before it was too late.

73
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,981
Now, come to Ryo's bedroom!

74
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,923
Just what you'd expect from combat
skills taught by Umibozu.

75
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,893
Thank you for the invitation, but I'm sorry,

76
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,884
I have to go meet someone now.

77
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,265
That hurt. It's not a man, is it?


78
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:03,201
My, you have good intuition.
Of course it's a gentleman.

79
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,472
She's going on a date with a guy?

80
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,709
Then maybe that Umibozu bastard
really got dumped.

81
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,777
No way.

82
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,713
No, it's possible! She was dressed to go out.

83
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,817
Unforgivable! A perfectly good guy
is right in front of her,

84
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,919
and she goes out on a date
with another man.

85
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,216
I think I'll go check things out.

86
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,992
What did you do that for?!

87
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,028
Things will get complicated if you go!

88
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,724
I'm worried, so I'll go.

89
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,365
I think it'll get more complicated if she goes.

90
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,179
What?! No way!

91
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,648
Could this be what's called an affair?

92
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,149
How exquisite.

93
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:54,554
Even the most beautiful flowers
look like weeds before you.

94
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,357
I'm very happy to hear that,

95
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,461
but could we please talk business first,
Mr. Itaro Samonji?

96
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,896
Oh, yes, of course!

97
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,431
About that...

98
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,958
My mother says she would like to
see you first before she decides.

99
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:16,209
To be honest, the job involves a very delicate
problem regarding the Samonji family.

100
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:21,013
Therefore, my mother would like to
speak directly to you.

101
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,950
So, I would like it if you could
come to my house.

102
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,051
Right now?

103
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,847
Yes...

104
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,993
Oh my, he's really rich! This is serious!

105
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,031
Oh, Kaori!

106
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,881
It's physical bonding between the
shop owner and the employee!

107
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:59,018
Did Umibozu really ask you to take care
of the shop, Mr. Saeba?

108
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,219
Of course!

109
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,054
That idiot, making stories up.

110
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,589
Listen to me, Kasumi.

111
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,994
With Umibozu gone, it's my duty
to protect you and Miki.

112
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,395
Gone?

113
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,497
He's as good as dead.

114
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,699
Who's as good as dead?!

115
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,001
Umibozu!

116
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,103
Hey, you're still alive!

117
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,839
The cat's in the back. She's not in the shop.

118
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,074
I thought you weren't coming back.

119
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,577
Shut up! It's none of your business!

120
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,611
Where's Miki?

121
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,078
On a date with another guy.

122
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,217
Oh, my, did that come as a shock to you?

123
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,187
Bastard! You'd better not be lying!

124
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,823
Shut up! Miki said it herself!

125
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,891
You're lying! There's no way
she would do that!

126
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,792
Oh, so you're jealous?

127
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,730
Ah! The cat!

128
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,200
Where?! Go away! Shoo! Shoo!

129
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,897
He's lying, Umibozu. Taki's in the back room.

130
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,673
Why, you little!

131
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,841
Kasumi!

132
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,705
No!

133
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,481
What was that?


134
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,517
It's terrible! Miki is...

135
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,449
Umibozu...

136
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,120
What's wrong, Kaori?

137
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,355
What is it? Tell us.

138
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,847
Well... Oh, boy...

139
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,039
Thank you for waiting. This is my mother.

140
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,376
I am his mother, Haruko. You are Miss Miki?
Nice to meet you.

141
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,072
I have had various investigations
done concerning you.

142
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,118
Since you are to be with Itaro,
you will, of course,

143
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,747
have to separate from the current
gentleman you are seeing.

144
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,491
What is this about?

145
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,494
Your marriage to Itaro, of course.

146
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,328
Marriage?!

147
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,732
That is correct. I am going to
be marrying you.

148
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,735
What are you talking about?!
I came here for a job!

149
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,405
Well, if you marry me, you will not
have to perform such jobs.

150
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,440
I will allow you to have all
the luxury in the world.

151
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,977
Don't talk such nonsense. Who decided this?


152
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:09,749
I did, of course. Since Itaro
wishes to marry you,

153
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,251
I will see the two of you joined,
no matter what.

154
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,486
Miss Miki,

155
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,789
you are not a woman who should be
with that monstrous man.

156
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,959
You should marry me and be happy.

157
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,227
Don't touch me!

158
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:21,994
Momma!

159
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,164
My! How dare you do such a thing
to my precious Itaro?!

160
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,631
Are you okay?

161
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,866
I'll be going home now.

162
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:42,448
Miss Miki, it seems that you need some
education in order to become

163
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,352
a woman suitable for the Samonji family
and to be Itaro's wife.

164
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,922
And for that, you will be staying
in this house for a while.

165
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,024
It will be useless to try and escape.

166
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,127
This mansion is fully equipped
with a security system

167
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,496
and you will be burnt to a crisp,
should you take one wrong step.

168
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,057
I would hate to see that happen
to Itaro's bride.

169
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,471
What?! Miki's having an affair?!

170
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,642
Yes, and the man she's seeing
seems to be pretty wealthy.

171
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,811
Did you hear that? She's having an affair.

172
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,979
I don't blame her.

173
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,471
After all, she has to look at an octopus-brain
like you every day.

174
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,914
Hello? Cat's Eye.

175
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,322
Please hold on.

176
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,483
Umibozu, it's for you.

177
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,592
Here.

178
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,029
Umibozu here.

179
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,863
What?!

180
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,032
You will not see Miss Miki anymore.

181
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,768
Also, I have sent a check to you.

182
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,004
Please write in whatever amount
you'd like and use it.

183
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,372
It is a consolation for your losses.

184
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,738
Is this what Miki wants?

185
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,512
She will be marrying the heir
of the Samonji family,

186
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,981
one of the few illustrious families in Japan.

187
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,109
What more could she want? Goodbye.

188
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,189
This is getting to be rather strange.

189
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,457
What's going on?

190
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,028
It seems like Miki's going to marry
the heir to the Samonji family.

191
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,164
Samonji family? You mean the owners
of Samonji Corporations?

192
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,766
In the lap of luxury!

193
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,530
Umibozu, are you going to
allow this to happen?!

194
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,206
It's the path that Miki chose. It has
nothing to do with me anymore.

195
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:18,973
That's not true! Do you really think
that she chose this path?!

196
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,022
Where are you going?!
Don't run away, Umibozu!

197
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,924
Umibozu, you idiot!

198
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,163
What a clumsy guy.

199
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,454
This is the way it should be.

200
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,857
Now, she can lead a happy life
as a normal woman.

201
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,096
She won't have to be stuck to
a partner like me

202
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,566
and be immersed in my dangerous
and bloody world.

203
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,602
So, your job as her guardian is done?

204
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,970
Ryo!

205
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,506
I seem to remember going
through this before.

206
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,209
What a depressing guy. When things
aren't going your way,

207
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,377
you always shut yourself away
into your own little world.

208
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,579
What did you come here for?!

209
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,714
If it's about Miki, I don't want to hear it!

210
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,912
I just thought I'd notify you, since
you were her guardian.

211
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:38,524
It's the duty of a mokkori man to win over
a woman's love, you see.

212
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,259
I'm going to go get Miki.

213
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,727
What?!

214
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:46,130
I won't give up on Miki, even if
the other guy's a billionaire!

215
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,757
Hey, I didn't know you had a
spare pair of sunglasses.

216
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,531
But there's no spare for Miki.

217
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,176
Right around now, I bet she's
shut up in a small room,

218
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,945
shouting, "Save me, Saeba!"

219
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,181
If I save her, she'll probably give me a kiss,

220
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,513
and she might even let me mokkori with her!

221
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,286
Well, Ryo's going now!

222
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,222
Miki, wait for me!
Stop, Ryo! If you wreck Miki's happiness,

223
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,123
I'll never forgive you!

224
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,724
No, I won't let you shoot him!
I'll never forgive you!

225
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,324
No, I won't let you shoot him!

226
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,661
Out of the way, Kaori! Are you taking
that mokkori guy's side?!

227
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,798
That's right! For once, you're wrong!

228
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,532
What?

229
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,067
Miki even made a bet with Ryo that
she'd mokkori with him,

230
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,370
just so she could be together with you!

231
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,973
You think someone like that would go to
another man just for money?!

232
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:32,311
Is that what you think Miki is like?!
Don't you trust her?!

233
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,181
That's just pitiful! You're contemptible!

234
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,652
But she's not a kid. If she wanted
to escape, she could.

235
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,955
You really don't understand women, do you?

236
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:47,726
A woman wants to make sure of a man's
love for her once in a while.

237
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:51,059
I always have a hard time with that
dense bastard too!

238
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,000
Anyway!

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,767
As her partner, why don't you at least
make sure that she's happy?!

240
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,343
What in the world is this family thinking?!

241
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:15,154
Well, maybe it's a good chance to
find out how much Falcon cares.

242
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,382
I'm such a bad woman.

243
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,767
Miss Miki, do you like it?

244
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,404
We specially prepared this room for you.

245
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,567
The furniture in this room is the finest
in the world, of course.

246
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,745
The dresses, suits, purses, and furs

247
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,514
are all in the most modern styles
from the finest brands.

248
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,505
Even the underwear is high-leg silk...


249
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,153
Well, that doesn't really matter.

250
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:53,648
Anyway, I think you can see that if you
marry me, a rosy future awaits you.

251
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,764
Are you still thinking of that giant?

252
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,766
I have something good to show you.

253
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,901
Take a look at this.

254
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,731
This is...

255
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,272
One of our hired detectives took that photo.

256
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:10,309
He's making a pass at the shop girl
now that you're not there.

257
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,276
He wouldn't!

258
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,013
That is his true nature.

259
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,483
Do you see just what kind of man he is?

260
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,112
Now, forget about him and come to me!

261
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,991
This is too ridiculous. I don't feel
like hanging around anymore.

262
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,526
I will be going home now.

263
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,961
It's no use.

264
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,297
This room is built like a safe.

265
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,632
The door won't open until 8 o'clock
tomorrow morning.

266
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:34,826
What?!

267
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,505
It'll just be the two of us until then.

268
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,972
Get used to it.

269
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,378
If you come within reach of me, your
neck is going to be broken!

270
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,472
Momma, Miki's being scary!

271
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,578
It looks like it will take some time
to educate this girl.

272
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:58,522
Itaro, hang in there.
Momma's cheering for you.

273
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,264
My, this mansion looks heavily guarded.

274
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:09,325
But for mokkori, I'll go through fire or water!

275
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,171
What?!


276
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,710
It's an intruder! Activate the
special security system!

277
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,404
Roger!

278
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,612
What are you doing up there?

279
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:24,049
You bastard! I was trying to sneak in quietly!

280
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,352
Then you come along and blow a huge hole!

281
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,786
Sneaking around isn't my style.

282
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,724
What did you come here for anyway?!

283
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,227
Kaori told me to come, as Miki's partner,

284
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,196
to make sure with my own eyes
that she's happy.

285
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,666
You say this and that, but in the end,

286
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,430
you're worried about Miki, aren't you?

287
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,244
Hey, you didn't have to shoot
right at my face!

288
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,415
I saved you when you were about to
get hit by a laser beam.

289
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,848
Be grateful!

290
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,686
They must be Miss Miki's friends.

291
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,424
This is perfect. With those two gone,
she will be Itaro's.

292
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,126
Report to me when you've gotten rid of them.

293
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,593
Yes, Ma'am!

294
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,722
Umibozu!

295
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,400
That was close. Be grateful.

296
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,426
Bastard! You did that on purpose!
You won't get away with it!

297
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,233
You idiot! Stop!

298
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,576
Oh, yeah? Fine! If that's how
you want to play...

299
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,046
The world would be a better place
with you dead!

300
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,747
Shut up! You octopus!

301
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,840
Drop dead, you mokkori bastard! Die!

302
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,326
They should really take this more seriously.

303
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,920
But it looks like they've broken through
the security system.

304
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,910
You're late! Make your reports
more quickly in the future!

305
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,211
What report?

306
00:17:59,211 --> 00:17:59,939
What?!

307
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:05,117
Although, I can report that your security
system's totally useless.

308
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,418
Impossible!

309
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,355
How could such an expensive security
system be useless?!

310
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,493
There should've been a lot of security
guards on the way here!

311
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,324
You mean the guys who're sleeping?

312
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,671
I hate this! I'm gonna quit this job!

313
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,140
Now, Granny, where's Miki?

314
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,110
Who are you calling a granny?!
I'm still in my forties!

315
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,711
Out of the way, Ryo!

316
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,012
I don't have time to play around!

317
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,345
If you want to look nice in the mirror
tomorrow morning, then hurry up and talk!

318
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,019
Please don't hurt my beautiful face!

319
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,182
She's in the next room. We've taken
good care of her.

320
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,826
Miki? I'm coming!

321
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,428
What're you so excited about?

322
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,298
Well, if I save her first, maybe
I could get a kiss.

323
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:53,957
No?

324
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,336
Oh, did we fall into a trap?

325
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,310
Hi! Seating for two, right over here!

326
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,608
Welcome!

327
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,044
I sure envy the way billionaires live!

328
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:18,589
So, why don't you forget about that
perverted man and marry me?

329
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,328
Falcon!

330
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,164
Really?! You're all working part-time?

331
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,965
What's your name? Tell me
your phone number.

332
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,593
I'm Ryo Saeba! I'm twenty years old!

333
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,338
Now, you will be able to see
what he's truly like.

334
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,636
Watch carefully.

335
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,911
This is perfect.

336
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,713
Now you'll be able to see for
yourself what he's like.

337
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,317
You'll see that I am much more serious
about you than he is.

338
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,552
Falcon!

339
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,248
If you act like Saeba in front of me,
I'll never forgive you!

340
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,130
That's right, Falcon! I'm right here!

341
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,665
It's just your imagination.

342
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,602
That window is a one-way mirror, and it has a
triple layer of specially reinforced glass.

343
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,662
It would never transmit sound
made from just hitting it.

344
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,984
Falcon...

345
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,352
How futile.

346
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,219
You can't break this glass with
a gun, much less by hand.

347
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,457
Impossible!

348
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,798
No way.

349
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,857
He broke specially reinforced glass
with his bare hands?

350
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,263
Falcon...

351
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,773
Miki...

352
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,110
What have you been doing?! You're late!

353
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,113
I could've escaped from here by myself,
but I waited for you!

354
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,617
I forgive you.

356
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,781
When you were breaking the glass, your
stern expression was so cool.

357
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,982
Itaro, are you all right?

358
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,726
Thanks for having us, Granny.

359
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,432
Who are you calling a granny?! I told you,
I'm still in my forties!

360
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,135
Momma, it's not fair!

361
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,104
Don't cry, Itaro.

362
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,440
Momma will find a much better
woman for you,

363
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,777
so just play with the girls here
until then, okay?

364
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,646
Okay, but he's...

365
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,447
C'mon, let's party! Who's next?!

366
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,249
You're so naughty!
C'mon, let's party! Who's next?!

367
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:28,447
Mokkori, mokkori, mokkori.
Everyone together now!

368
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,825
Oh, so you took Taki?

369
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,796
Yes, they can't keep her here,
you know? So, I took her.

370
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:42,165
But it's hard to believe that Umibozu
is afraid of a cute cat like that.

371
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,136
I'm not afraid of them.

372
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,196
I just hate how they're so weak.
Don't misunderstand.

373
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,432
Come to think of it, do you know where
Ryo is? He didn't come home last night.

374
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,381
I wonder where he is?

375
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,849
We left before he did, so we
wouldn't know, right?

376
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,083
Man, what the heck is he doing?

377
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,025
Miss Kaori Makimura, I presume?

378
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,515
Please come with us.

379
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,732
Wow! You're giving me all this?!

380
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:18,036
Please, go home. We will pay you
any amount that you want.

381
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,706
Did you hear?! She'll give me
any amount I want!

382
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,076
All right! I'll keep doing mokkori here
for the rest of my life!

383
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,509
Momma!
Itaro!

384
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,537
Now, everyone together! Mokkori!

385
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,012
Messenger of Justice
Enough is enough!

386
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,086
No! Ryo doesn't want to go home!
I want to stay here forever!

387
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,054
No! Ryo doesn't want to go home!
I want to stay here forever!
Flying through the sunrise

388
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,156
Damn it! Men! They're all the same!

389
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,658
Damn it! Men! They're all the same!
Searching for the sunset

390
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,522
Searching for the sunset

391
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:57,532
Mou kuchibeni kaete mo tokimekanai no yo

392
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:02,978
Yume no iro ni wa toui kara

393
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:11,253
Hi no tama no you na asahi o mini iku tabi e

394
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,695
Moshi anata mo sasoetara

395
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:26,002
Hane no you ni maiagaruwa sora e

396
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:34,246
Atsuku naretara sore de ii

397
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:42,585
Kono mune ni kitto mienai hi ga noboru

398
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:50,551
Ookina mono o mitsumetai

399
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:57,068
Chiiisana tsuyogari mo hadashi no mama

400
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:02,199
Nigete yuku yo

401
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,181
Do you know Professor Jean Louis Thoreau?

402
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,982
He's famous for his underwater
documentary films.

403
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,485
So, Ayano's on his research vessel.

404
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,520
And he said their boat gets raided
once in a while.

405
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,522
It's got to be dangerous being with
a middle-aged guy like that.

406
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,857
After all, it's just the two of them.

407
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,560
All right! Relax as if you were on a
big ship. You can count on me!

408
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,795
Big ship? More like a pirate ship.

409
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,096
City Hunter 3:

410
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,933
"Love is Diving!
When a Beauty Puts On a Swimsuit"

411
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,628
You'll sink if you don't watch!
