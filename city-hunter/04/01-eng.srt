1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,608
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
One can a day
Careful, don't drink too much!
Hi
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,482
Frustration comes knocking on my door

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,319
Wolves that can't run

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,156
Wander around, clawing at the darkness

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,455
The last time I saw you

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
Was in the dusty crowds

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,401
Your accusing gaze

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,667
Left an ache in my back as I walked away

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,877
The roadway has been blocked by fog

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,680
Even now, I'm still looking for the answer

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,446
In the clueless night sky

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,388
The horizon stretches out

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, a sky
without constellations

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, a path
without common sense

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,244
Wow, wow, wow, seeking only kindness

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,907
Wow, wow, wow, facing loneliness

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,075
Wow, wow, wow, I don't need you like that

28
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:28,636
De-Mokkori Declaration!
XYZ Saves the World

29
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,182
What'll we do if we don't get a case today?

30
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,931
I'm so hungry. And our savings are gone.

31
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,523
This is a life or death situation.

32
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,293
If you don't have any money,
put it on the tab!

33
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,332
Man, I'm stuffed. Thanks for the food!

34
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,915
Hello? Saeba Firm.

35
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:02,779
Yo, Kaori?

36
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,952
Ryo! Yes! Yes! Yes!

37
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,977
What? Did a guy hit on you?

38
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,256
That happens all the time!

39
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,451
Anyway, come to the station right away!

40
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,994
What in the world is going on?

41
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,037
Hey, Kaori, what's with the
drama queen pose?

42
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,801
Ryo! That! That! Look at that!

43
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,011
Wow, XYZ!

44
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,113
See? Isn't it just great?!

45
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,104
What's XYZ again?

46
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,652
It's our first case in three long months!

47
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,256
Oh, is it? I'd forgotten.

48
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,925
Oh, really? Then I'll make you remember!

49
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,893
Oh, I remember! I remember!

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,461
What? What's wrong, Kaori?

51
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,663
I'm hungry. I need to eat something.

52
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,434
I've got enough to buy some bread.

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,152
I finally feel better now.

54
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,855
But I never thought you'd accept
a job from a woman.

55
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,991
I guess necessity knows no law.

56
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,493
Pretty much, we're in no position to be picky.


57
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,962
When we get paid, I'm going to
eat until I burst.

58
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,199
Steak, sushi, kaiseki ryouri, shabu-shabu...

59
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,167
And to top it off, definitely an ikura-don.

60
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,805
The person who hired us is
Miss Misuzu Moriwaki.

61
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,500
She'll be wearing a white carnation.

62
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,417
Mokkori!

63
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,384
Hey, Ryo!

64
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,086
Sorry for the wait.

65
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,389
I've come to relieve you of your heartache.

66
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,482
Well, you are...

67
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,095
You pass, magnificent mokkori size.

68
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,325
Look at you, Mr. Impulsive!

69
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,693
88 C-cup...

70
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,796
Very good, Sir. Room 88 C, Sir?

71
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,882
I am a temporary staff member
of the Rubiria Embassy.

72
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,817
My name is Misuzu Moriwaki.

73
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,086
I am an interpreter as well as a guide.

74
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,722
Wow, an international occupation!

75
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,986
Her size is international too.

76
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,899
You want us to be your bodyguards
and capture the culprit, right?

77
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,234
Well, I'd like to request the bodyguard part.

78
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,937
I would like you to protect me
for just three days,

79
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,633
but you don't need to find the culprit.

80
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,943
Does this mean that you don't
want the police involved?

81
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,411
I'm sorry for being so arbitrary.

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,382
Is this not possible?

83
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,719
Nothing is impossible in the
face of 88 C-cups!

84
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,744
Do you have a lover, Misuzu?

85
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,756
Here we go.

86
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,391
No, I don't.

87
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,594
Excellent! Leave it all up to Ryo Saeba!

88
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:06,399
No lover, that means the feel of those
88 C-cups belongs to no one!

89
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,404
Too bad! Currently, the bra size
standard is changing.

90
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,173
But the larger the number the better!

91
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,609
Kaori, stop worrying about that, and
let's enjoy the feel together!

92
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,148
I don't want to enjoy such things!

93
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,174
Ryo doesn't want to enjoy this feeling either.

94
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,962
Oh, Mr. Saeba, where are we headed?

95
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,798
Come home with us. You can
hide out there for a while.

96
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,434
There's nowhere that could be safer.

97
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,736
What part of your face expresses safety?

98
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:49,231
Kaori, if I can't do things my way,
I'm turning down this job!

99
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,102
Steak! Shabu-shabu! Ikura-don!
Think it through!

100
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,054
Here we are.

101
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,524
You've got nothing to worry about
as long as you're here.

102
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,491
Okay!

103
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,560
It's actually more worrisome this way.

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,864
Oh, no! Thank you so much
for paying in advance!

105
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,734
Not at all. I'm the one with the
unreasonable requests.

106
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,402
Come on, I'll show you to your room.

107
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,699
Ah, okay, okay.

108
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,673
It's all because we're poor!

109
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,301
This is just so pitiful.

110
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,011
Please come in.

111
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,151
What is this?!

112
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,853
What? They're bowls from deliveries.

113
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,023
I know that! Who ate them?!

114
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,890
Me. Who else? Here's the bill.

115
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,596
You ate all you wanted to without me?

116
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,900
You ate all this by yourself right when
I was starving to death?!

117
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,505
Now, now, thanks to Misuzu, we get to
eat steak tonight, remember?

118
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:56,635
That's right! We have steak tonight!
I better go cook it now!

119
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,842
I'll take that delivery bill out of
your monthly allowance.

120
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,684
My, this looks delicious!

121
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,709
Thank you for the food!

122
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,893
It's delicious! I haven't had meat
in three months!

123
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,127
It's like a dream!

124
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,924
It really is delicious!

125
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,162
There's no steak on Mr. Saeba's plate.

126
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,536
Hey! What are you, a snake?!

127
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,697
Don't eat it in one bite! Not in one bite!

128
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,266
What a waste!

129
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,712
Oh, I'm sorry.

130
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:37,706
I've been rather depressed lately, but
it's fun watching you two.

131
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,187
And when you're living alone,
meals are so dreary.

132
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,688
What?! Living alone?!

133
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,291
Yes, please come visit sometime.

134
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,953
Yeah, I'll come, I'll come! You only
have to set up one bed...

135
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,520
You moron.

136
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,567
I'll put the bath towel here.
Please use this.

137
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,768
Thank you so much.

138
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,739
Just to be safe, you should lock the
door right away after I leave.

139
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,406
Okay!

140
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,338
Okay!

141
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,142
Okay, it's locked.

142
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,345
Hey, Ryo, what are you doing?!
Open this door!

143
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,480
Mr. Saeba?

144
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,949
Now, I'll help you take these off.

145
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,246
You're troubling me.

146
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,887
If you're in trouble, then so am I.

147
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,218
We should help each other.

148
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,055
You're so forceful.

149
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,254
Misuzu...

150
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,597
Konpeitou 1

151
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,236
Ms. Kaoru, I did it, I did it!

152
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,637
It was so much fun!

153
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,400
See? Isn't he easy to trick?

154
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,342
I guess they were playing
with poor little me.

155
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,275
Here we go.

156
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,156
I'll sleep on the sofa here tonight,

157
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,024
so you don't have anything to worry about.

158
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,727
You don't have to go to such lengths.
I'll be fine.

159
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,957
Please, Ms. Kaori, you go sleep
with Mr. Saeba.

160
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,199
With Ryo?! Quit joking around!

161
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,669
Oh, but you and Mr. Saeba are
married, aren't you?

162
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:08,741
No, no! We're just working partners.
We're not married.

163
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,378
We only live in the same place
because it's convenient.

164
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,047
And my room isn't even on
the same floor as his.

165
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,148
I see.

166
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,719
But Mr. Saeba easily gets mokkori
around women, right?

167
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,687
I'm surprised you've managed to
stay safe all this time.

168
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,626
Oh! Well, I have my lethal
hammer, you know?

169
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,694
So, that mokkori man can't get close to me.

170
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,129
That makes sense.

171
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,734
There's no way he would leave an
attractive woman like you alone.

172
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,031
Right, right.

173
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,904
What an empty conversation.

174
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,083
Guest Room

175
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,491
That's useless. If you're sneaking into
the lady's bed, get in line.

176
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,480
Bastard!

177
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,089
Damn!

178
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,161
You won't get away!

179
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,093
Konpeitou 2

180
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,936
Don't you ever learn?!

181
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,605
Did you come to sneak into her bed?!

182
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,540
No!

183
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,508
There was a suspicious guy...

184
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,922
Your sneaking into a woman's bed
is practically a mental illness.

185
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,558
I'm telling you that it's a mistake!

186
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,027
There really was a suspicious guy
with a gun!

187
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,996
You really think I'm going to believe that?

188
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,395
I believe him.

189
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,935
I don't agree with Mr. Saeba's
mokkori activities,

190
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,705
but I think he's someone who is
honest with his feelings.

191
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,074
I don't think someone like that

192
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,476
would try to justify himself
with lame excuses.

193
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,345
Well, I guess that's one way to look at it.

194
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:57,116
And seeing Mr. Saeba like this, I've decided

195
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,277
to be honest with my feelings.

196
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:10,696
Miss Misuzu, you're a target!
It's dangerous to go outside.

197
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,723
Oh, but isn't it dangerous at home too?
The evil hand of mokkori...

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,669
True.

199
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,638
If it's dangerous all the same, I'd rather
be doing what I want.

200
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,775
But outside, your life's in danger.

201
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,944
But you're here to protect me, right?

202
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,811
Well, of course, but...

203
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,327
What's all this?

204
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,727
Here, please put this around your neck.

205
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,501
I'm sure it's boring to just be a bodyguard,
so please help out.

206
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:52,505
"Restore the forests of Rubiria."
This is a donation box, isn't it?

207
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,906
Excuse me...

208
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,076
You don't mean for me to stand in
the street with this, do you?

209
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:02,742
Rubiria's nature is steadily being destroyed
due to logging by Japanese industry.

210
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,019
Currently, the forests are down to a
third of what they used to be.

211
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,749
My father was also involved in this.

212
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,727
My father lived in Rubiria for a
long time as an engineer.

213
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:19,096
I would visit every year and spend
the summer with him.

214
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,135
But the forests and hills of Rubiria
that were my playground

215
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,932
disappeared year by year.

216
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,974
When it rains in Rubiria, the rivers
rise into floods

217
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:35,436
and weak ledges turn into landslides,
causing a lot of damage.

218
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:40,614
And it's all due to the unreasonable logging
by Japan in order to import their lumber.

219
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,590
It came as a shock to me when
I learned that my father

220
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,117
was also helping in the destruction of
what I considered to be home.

221
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,197
My father has quit his job since then,

222
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,223
and he is now supporting a movement
to restore nature there.

223
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,937
Partly due to my rebellion against my father,

224
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,998
I've been troubled because I haven't been
true to myself and joined the movement.

225
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,711
That's when I saw how honest
Mr. Saeba is to himself,

226
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,380
and I realized that being
stubborn was wrong.

227
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,985
Being honest to himself? I'm not sure
how to feel about that.

228
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,589
All right, Ryo's going to help out!
De-mokkori declaration!

229
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,226
That sounds good! XYZ will save the world!

230
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,523
Thank you!

231
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,898
Everyone, please help fund this endeavor.

232
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,901
Please! Leave a donation to help us
restore the forests of Rubiria!
Hey, you're too quiet. Speak up
so they can hear you!

233
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,537
Please help fund this endeavor!

234
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,807
Let's protect Rubiria's forests!
Here, thank you.

235
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,642
Please help us out!

236
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,877
Here, Mister.

237
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,845
Woo-hoo, thanks a lot!

238
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,379
Bye-bye.

239
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,142
I hope I'll see you again in ten years.

240
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,717
Please help us out!

241
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,453
Let's restore the forests of Rubiria!

242
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,318
Please help us out!

243
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,600
Damn!

244
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,502
Stop right there!

245
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,774
No! Don't go after him, Mr. Saeba! Please!

246
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,175
But...

247
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,110
Leave him alone. It's okay now. Please?

248
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,646
Misuzu...

249
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,552
You must have a hell of a reason not to
want the culprit captured.

250
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,988
I'm sorry. I'm sure I'll be able to
tell you tomorrow.

251
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,650
Miss Misuzu, could it be that you
know who the culprit is?

252
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,962
Please wait until tomorrow for that.

253
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,604
Damn it! When are you going to
finish her off?!

254
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,504
Rubirian Embassy
Damn it! When are you going to
finish her off?!

255
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:45,477
I am sorry, Aide Gary, but a
strange man got in my way.

256
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,147
A strange man? Who is this man?

257
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,817
Well, in his neighborhood, he is apparently
known as Ryo the Playboy.

258
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,552
Playboy?!

259
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,522
Why does a man like that have a gun?!

260
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,291
That man probably isn't just anybody.

261
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,227
After all, he aimed at my gun and
broke it with one shot.

262
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,964
It was truly magnificent gunmanship.

263
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,632
You idiot!

264
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,101
What is the point of admiring him?!

265
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,400
We have to finish this tonight,
no matter what we do!

266
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,399
Today is the last day that she won't be
publicizing the matter!

267
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,715
I can't just leave this up to you any longer.

268
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,383
Take me to this man.

269
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,611
Yes, Sir!

270
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,559
Kaori should be exhausted from
passing out those fliers,

271
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,527
but I must make my move cautiously.

272
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,740
My, covered to her head in her blanket.

273
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,408
Let's take a look at her cute sleeping face.

274
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,375
What?

275
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,938
Scary!

276
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,409
Save me!

277
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,209
Scary?! What am I, a monster,
you bastard?!

278
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,522
Kaori, forgive me!

279
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,289
Ryo was a bad boy!

280
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,759
Stay there until morning!
Ryo was a bad boy!


281
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,528
Now, I can sleep in my own room.

282
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,930
Will Mr. Saeba be all right?

283
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,365
Don't worry about it. This is normal.

284
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,833
Help me!
Don't worry about it. This is normal.

285
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,527
Help me!

286
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,971
Oh, God! Oh, Buddha! Oh, Kaori!
I won't do it again!

287
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,273
Oh, God! Oh, Buddha! Oh, Kaori!
I won't do it again!
Is that the man you were talking about?

288
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,674
Oh, God! Oh, Buddha! Oh, Kaori!
I won't do it again!
Yes, no mistake about it.

289
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,277
Ryo doesn't like the cold, and I might
get sick! Don't you care?!
And that doesn't look like a
normal guy to you?

290
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,245
It's freezing out here!
No, he does.

291
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,146
What might you be worrying about?

292
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,287
Mr. Saeba! When did you...

293
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,695
The Japanese government will sign a deal
to aid nature conservation in Rubiria.

294
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,855
That's tomorrow, isn't it?

295
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,131
Yes!

296
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,035
If a scandal worth media coverage
breaks out before the signing,

297
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,003
it will have a subtle influence
on the aid package.

298
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:57,443
It'll be an especially large scandal if someone
from the embassy is involved.

299
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,511
Mr. Saeba, how did you know?

300
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,537
But I don't understand why
you're being targeted.

301
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,479
Actually, I overheard them talking.

302
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,422
I was working overtime late at night,

303
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,225
and I went to get Aide Gary's signature.

304
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,360
The door was ajar.

305
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,596
What do you think, Aide Gary?

306
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,633
The Heavenly Paramita Statue is a work of art
on par with Japan's national treasures.

307
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,635
Well done!

308
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,873
Japanese works of art sell at
a high price overseas.

309
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:32,044
Indeed, Japanese collectors have slack
security despite the value of those works.

310
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,569
Stealing them is a piece of cake.

311
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,350
Who's there?!

312
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,753
They must have seen me from behind
when I became afraid and ran away.

313
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:48,155
Strange things began to happen
around me after that.

314
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,229
Smuggling by exploiting the fact

315
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,031
that embassy packages don't
go through customs.

316
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,434
You're a witness to that.

317
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,493
If this becomes public,

318
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,241
Japan's nature conservation aid might be
withdrawn altogether!

319
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,144
Right now, Rubiria absolutely
needs Japan's aid!

320
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,772
To revive the destroyed environment!

321
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,184
So, you can't inform the police
until tomorrow.

322
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,087
But it looks like you can't be
so particular anymore.

323
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,578
It seems that tonight is their deadline.

324
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,062
Open it.

325
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,676
What is this doll?!

326
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,945
Sneaking into her bed again, Ryo?!

327
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,936
You won't get away with it!

328
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,516
Who is this woman?!

329
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,575
She's a friend of this so-called
Ryo the Playboy.

330
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,721
Where are Ryo and Miss Misuzu?

331
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,291
That's what we want to know!
Where are they?!

332
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,692
Over here.

333
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,328
Where?! Where are you?!

334
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,762
We've got a good view of
the moon from here.

335
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,135
Hello, we meet again.

336
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,536
Scary!

337
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,662
Bastard!

338
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,410
Don't move! Move and she dies!

339
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,283
Our job is to protect Misuzu, who hired us.

340
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,343
For that, Kaori will gladly die.
Isn't that right?

341
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,355
Mr. Saeba, you can't...

342
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,189
What?!

343
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:29,328
That's right. I'd hate to be killed by
a guy like this, but I'm prepared.

344
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,929
Why you!

345
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,398
You've heard how good I am.

346
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,067
While you shoot Kaori,

347
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,934
I'll put a bullet through your head without fail.

348
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,072
It's your life.

349
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,471
Choose whichever way you like.

350
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,577
Miss Kaori...

351
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,039
You bastard!

352
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,727
Man, unconscious with his eyes
rolled back into his head.

353
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,128
Looks painful.

354
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,930
If I'd been shot,

355
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,599
you'd better have at least shed
some tears for me.

356
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,034
Well, maybe one drop.

357
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,763
Oh my, thank you ever so much!

358
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,205
As if I'd ever stand for dying before you do!

359
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,834
I'm going to plague you for the rest of
your life and watch how you die.

360
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,915
All these two ever do is defy one another,

361
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,145
but they're actually bound by
a deep sense of trust.

362
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,849
What an envious duo.

363
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,963
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

364
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,967
Those two will be sent back to our
country on a flight tonight.

365
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,204
Thanks to you, we were able to resolve the
matter without it becoming a scandal.

366
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,074
As the ambassador of Rubiria, I thank you.

367
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,144
But Mr. Saeba, how were you able to return

368
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,646
the Heavenly Paramita Statue
without any commotion?

369
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,015
Nothing to it. There's an official at the
Metropolitan Police Department

370
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,684
who owes me a lot of favors.

371
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,811
I got her to pull some strings for me.

372
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,890
Lately, the number of favors Miss Saeko
owes you is going down without any mokkori.

373
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,380
That's a good thing.

374
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,728
I will forget my prejudices against my father

375
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,432
and go help his movement to save
the environment in Rubiria.

376
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,633
That's good.

377
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,335
Here's a piece of advice.

378
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,670
If you truly love nature,

379
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,639
then wearing nothing on your 88 C-cups
would be most natural.

380
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,609
Okay!

381
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,545
Flying through the sunrise

382
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,390
Searching for the sunset

383
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:56,807
Changing the color of my lipstick
doesn't excite me anymore

384
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:02,244
Because its color is far from that of dreams

385
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:10,519
A journey to see a sunrise
like a ball of fire

386
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:15,961
If I could invite you too

387
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:25,268
I would take to the sky like a feather

388
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:33,512
If I can become passionate,
that's all I want

389
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:41,851
An invisible sun will surely rise in my heart

390
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,817
I want to gaze upon something grand

391
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:56,334
Even my bit of courage goes barefoot

392
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:01,465
And runs away

393
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,046
Who's the next mokkori?!

394
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,714
Refer to them as clients!

395
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,284
Of course, this is City Hunter and
we only get beautiful women.

396
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,118
See?

397
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,854
Miss Mei is an attorney. She's a
hard working career woman.

398
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,222
Working women are beautiful!

399
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,990
An intelligent beauty would be
perfect for me!

400
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,225
I've been waiting for a woman like her.

401
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,393
No kidding!

402
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,695
It's the perfect chance to sue Ryo
on charges of mokkori.

403
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,096
City Hunter 3:

404
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:28,600
"The Greatest Flagrant Love Committed!
How to Hit on a Beautiful Lawyer"

405
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,397
If you don't watch, you're guilty!
