1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,608
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
One can a day
Careful, don't drink too much!
Hi
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,482
Frustration comes knocking on my door

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,319
Wolves that can't run

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,156
Wander around, clawing at the darkness

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,455
The last time I saw you

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
Was in the dusty crowds

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,401
Your accusing gaze

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,667
Left an ache in my back as I walked away

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,877
The roadway has been blocked by fog

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,680
Even now, I'm still looking for the answer

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,446
In the clueless night sky

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,388
The horizon stretches out

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, a sky
without constellations

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, a path
without common sense

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,244
Wow, wow, wow, seeking only kindness

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,048
Wow, wow, wow, facing loneliness

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,075
Wow, wow, wow, I don't need you like that

28
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,796
Kazuhiko and Tsubaki love each other
so much that they eloped.

29
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,866
And we've been hired to make them split up?
That's terrible!

30
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,502
What in the world happened between the
Yamaoka and Umino families?

31
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,636
Who cares about that?

32
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,005
What's important is that Tsubaki's
father officially recognizes me,

33
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,007
and I'll be in the lap of luxury and mokkori!

34
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,066
Enough already, you mokkori monster!

35
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,213
But Tsubaki is so daring, don't you think?

36
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,883
She ran off with Kazuhiko from the party
at the Umino mansion!

37
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,384
There isn't time to be impressed.

38
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,353
There are suspicious people
following the couple.

39
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,354
What?

40
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:06,314
A Wedding Dress for Christmas
(Part 2)

41
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,749
Thank you, Sakurai. Take care.

42
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,808
Yes, you take care as well, Miss.

43
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,428
They've switched to a red, two-door Golf.

44
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,725
Roger.

45
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,861
We're following them.

46
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,592
There's something I want to ask you.
Step outside.

47
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:51,905
You think you have time for that?

48
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,530
What?
You think you have time for that?

49
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,292
Mr. Saeba!

50
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,305
Tsubaki, where are we headed?

51
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,806
Yokohama.

52
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,175
I have reservations on a ship
bound for Europe.

53
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,142
Europe?

54
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,879
I have friends in Switzerland.

55
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,849
They have a big ranch on pastureland
in a green valley.

56
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,080
I don't think even Papa or the others
will follow us overseas.

57
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,756
Are you okay, Tsubaki?!

58
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,848
Yeah...

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,457
I never thought she'd go to such
lengths to split us up.

60
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,466
We must have really hit a nerve in Mother.

61
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,934
No, it could be Papa.

62
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,106
Let's not think about that anymore.

63
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,174
Even if it's only us, let's be
joined in such a way

64
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,301
that we do not leave any hatred
behind in this world.

65
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,160
That man...

66
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,366
We'll take care of you first! Go!

67
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,943
Die!

68
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,800
No way!

69
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,302
Impossible! What a bastard.

70
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,017
It's safe now, nothing to
worry about anymore.

71
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,508
Well, thank you very much.

72
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,689
Tsubaki! Hang on!

73
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,358
Hey, me too!

74
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,825
Oh, no...

75
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,796
I thought she was a shrew, but
I guess she's a girl after all.

76
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,466
Make sure you hold onto her tight
and don't let her go.

77
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,235
I will. I'll never let go of her again.

78
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,171
You should hide out at my place for a while.

79
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh, but we're...

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,843
Nothing will ever be resolved if you
keep running away.

81
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,344
But...

82
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,747
The guys who came after you don't seem
to have been sent

83
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,807
by either the Yamaoka family
or the Umino family.

84
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,479
Mando Nakata

85
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,489
You failed?!

86
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,757
Yes, well...

87
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,327
Their bodyguard is actually
a rather remarkable guy

88
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,929
and he brought down a helicopter
with a gun in one shot.

89
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,264
Shut up!

90
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,502
I'm not paying you vast sums to hear
such ridiculous reports!

91
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,937
We know where those two are staying.

92
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,428
We'll definitely get them within
two or three days! Definitely!

93
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,178
That's enough! Report to me when
you've taken care of those two!

94
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,736
Yes, leave it to us!

95
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,905
Excuse us!

96
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,654
I won't stand for Yamaoka Shipping and
Umino Shipping joining forces!

97
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,656
It was because of the discord between them

98
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,259
that my Nakata Shipping was able
to grow to its current size

99
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,594
by taking advantage of their weaknesses.

100
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,130
No matter what happens, no matter
what I have to do,

101
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,429
I must keep those two from being married!

102
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,798
Mr. Saeba!

103
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,909
Did something happen to those two?!

104
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,504
They're safe. They're staying at my place.

105
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,315
I came tonight because I wanted
to ask you something.

106
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,807
What? Ask me, Sir?

107
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,553
What happened between the Yamaoka and
Umino families twenty-five years ago?

108
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,664
Watching the two of you
just makes me envious.

109
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,034
I wish I could have a life or death
love experience too.

110
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,069
You have someone you care
for too, don't you?

111
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,040
No, I don't. If I did, right now, I'd be...

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,340
Everyone has someone whose pinky is tied
with a red thread to another's pinky.

113
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,581
I'm sure someone wonderful will appear
in your life soon enough.

114
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,282
Thanks.

115
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,079
He might actually be quite close by.

116
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,310
Yeah, right.

117
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,254
Hello! Merry Christmas!

118
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,859
Ryo! What's with that getup?

119
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,794
What is it? I'm Santa Claus.

120
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,829
I can see that!

121
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,198
Really, leaving these two behind.

122
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,100
And here I was, wondering
where you'd run off to.

123
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,863
Here, a Christmas present.

124
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,705
Christmas Eve is tomorrow, right?

125
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,297
Never mind that.

126
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,313
What?! What is this?! It's a wedding dress!

127
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,215
It's not that three million yen one, is it?!

128
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,684
And I have a tuxedo over here too!

129
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,153
What is this, Ryo?! What's all this about?!

130
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,383
Wedding garments for Tsubaki and Kazuhiko!

131
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,127
Tomorrow's an auspicious day too.
It's Christmas Eve.

132
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,062
I'm saying, let's have a wedding
with everyone's blessing.

133
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,828
With everyone's blessing? But we're...

134
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,269
Never mind all that.

135
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,139
I've already reserved the church,
and I sent out the invitations.

136
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,441
Everything's ready.
The arrangements are set.

137
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,968
Anyway, let's have a toast!
A pre-celebration!

138
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:23,892
Sir, last night, Mr. Saeba asked me
to deliver this to you.

139
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,165
From that man?

140
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,689
This is it.

141
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,271
What's this? It's a wedding invitation.

142
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,136
So it appears.

143
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,171
Kazuhiko Umino and Tsubaki Yamaoka?!

144
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,479
Sakurai, what is the meaning of this?!

145
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,983
I don't know. I was only asked to deliver it.

146
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,787
Damn that Saeba! He betrayed me!

147
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,585
He's not fit to be called Mokkori Man!

148
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,095
Unforgivable.

149
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,656
I will never allow the daughter of such
a man to join the Umino family.

150
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,553
You two wait here.

151
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,611
Yes, Ma'am.

152
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,594
Wow! You look very beautiful, Tsubaki.

153
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,585
Thank you, Miss Kaori.

154
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,156
But is it really true?

155
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,966
Do the people who attacked us really have
nothing to do with either of our parents?

156
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,842
If Ryo says so, then it's true.

157
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,777
He might not seem that reliable,

158
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,337
but even so, he's much better at
his work than you'd expect.

159
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,840
Tsubaki, we've entrusted everything
to Mr. Saeba. Let's believe in him.

160
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,655
Yes!

161
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,555
Kazuhiko Umino
Tsubaki Yamaoka
Waiting Room

162
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,857
Mother! You came!

163
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,657
I am sorry, but I did not come
to give you my blessing.

164
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,328
I came to make you cancel this wedding.

165
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,572
You're still saying that...

166
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,039
I'm sorry to hear that, Mother.

167
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,744
Today, we will be formally married.

168
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,780
No matter what opposition we may face.


169
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,582
You do not seem to understand
the nature of the feud

170
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:27,541
between the Umino and Yamaoka families.

171
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,021
I understand.

172
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,222
Because we understand,

173
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,020
Tsubaki and I want to put an end
to this stupid feud now.

174
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,695
So young...

175
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,764
Yes, just like you when you were young.

176
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,733
They feel just the same as you did

177
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,903
when you almost married Mr. Yamaoka,
twenty-five years ago.

178
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,498
What?! Mother and Tsubaki's father
were almost married?!

179
00:11:55,981 --> 00:12:01,053
They became close to each other so rapidly
that their parents almost didn't realize it.

180
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,489
They were headed for a wedding with
just the two of them there.

181
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:09,394
They vowed to put a stop to their families'
feud with their generation.

182
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:15,868
But on the day of the wedding, for some
reason, they canceled it and separated.

183
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,671
Ever since then, the feud between the
two families has worsened,

184
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,673
and it has brought us to
our present situation.

185
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:25,778
It was Yamaoka, wasn't it? That shameless
Yamaoka told you that story, didn't he?

186
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,245
No.

187
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,087
The one who told me this was
the butler, Mr. Sakurai.

188
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,555
I see, Sakurai did.

189
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:43,195
Yes, he would know. He was the only one
who was on our side.

190
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:47,598
But I don't understand why you
suddenly canceled the wedding.

191
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,374
Very well, I will tell you

192
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,476
to make Kazuhiko wake from this dream!

193
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,909
Mother...

194
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,077
So, the Umino hag's here too.

195
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,279
Sir!


196
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,462
It's true. Twenty-five years ago,

197
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,260
Yamaoka and I went as far as holding
a wedding ceremony.

198
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:25,468
Back then, I believed that Yamaoka's
eyes only saw me.

199
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,437
But that was just an illusion.

200
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,578
On the day of our wedding,
he showed his true colors.

201
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,103
It was when we were exchanging
nuptial cups.

202
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,256
Of all things, right when he
was about to marry me,

203
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,247
he only had eyes for the priestess!

204
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:56,701
I was young and inexperienced,
but what a fool I'd fallen for.

205
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,433
I regret it even now.

206
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:04,038
That man got close to me only to make
a laughingstock of my family.

207
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,478
Now, do you see the reason

208
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,141
why I am so stubbornly against
your marriage?

209
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,618
I see.

210
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,821
I never knew Papa did such a
terrible thing to your mother.

211
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,324
Tsubaki, don't let it bother you.

212
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,160
No matter what our parents did,
it has nothing to do with us.

213
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,129
Kazuhiko, are you still saying such things?!

214
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,631
It isn't true!

215
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,427
Papa!

216
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,002
It was a misunderstanding.

217
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,771
I never had eyes for the priestess.

218
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,074
What a transparent lie! What do you
hope to accomplish by this?!

219
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,777
At that time, I was so ecstatic that
I was to be married to you

220
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:43,339
that my mind was filled with thoughts
of our rosy, married life.

221
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,119
An involuntary smile crept onto my face.

222
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,323
Right then, I may have been facing in
the direction of the priestess,

223
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,952
but I could see nothing but you.

224
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,997
I never even knew that the
priestess was there.

225
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,865
That... That's impossible. I can't believe that!

226
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,000
My lack of discretion is to blame for
such a misunderstanding.

227
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,905
But at least...

228
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,670
Please, Ms. Yuki Umino!

229
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,847
My daughter, Tsubaki, is not
responsible for any of this.

230
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:20,119
Please acknowledge her marriage
to Kazuhiko. I beg of you.

231
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,120
Papa!

232
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,587
Mother!

233
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,036
Mr. Yamaoka, please get up from there.

234
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,537
Then Tsubaki...

235
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,873
Yes, of course.

236
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,273
I am the one who must apologize.

237
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,608
We have paid far too heavy a price
for the mistake we made.

238
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,746
I would never want our children
to suffer the same.

239
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:54,945
Yuki...

240
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,090
Tsubaki!

241
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,387
Kazuhiko!

242
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,497
I don't know how to thank you.

243
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,557
Well, I guess I couldn't compete
with Tsubaki's dedication.

244
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,268
What a fool you are. You gave up a
parent-authorized mokkori.

245
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,708
We're both fools.

246
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,077
It's just that you're a fool only when
it comes to your daughter.

247
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,945
I'd like it if you two would attend
my daughter's wedding.

248
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,616
We've still got things to do before that.

249
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,413
We are still missing one guest.

250
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,277
Though the people must be burdened by
the cross due to our sins,

251
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,347
our merciful Lord in Heaven
could not look away

252
00:16:55,347 --> 00:17:00,686
from those who would tie the sacred
bonds of holy matrimony

253
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,388
What's wrong, Kaori?
And He bestows upon us
abundant blessings.

254
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,889
I'm just somehow happy.
And He bestows upon us
abundant blessings.

255
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:04,823
I'm just somehow happy.
Kazuhiko Umino, do you take
this woman to be your wife

256
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,593
Hey, this is just an act.
Kazuhiko Umino, do you take
this woman to be your wife

257
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:07,993
Kazuhiko Umino, do you take
this woman to be your wife

258
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:13,165
I know, but I was thinking how I wished
my brother could have seen this.
And to be bound to her in holy matrimony,
as the Lord decrees?

259
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,533
I know, but I was thinking how I wished
my brother could have seen this.
In times of sickness and in health,

260
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,201
And then suddenly, I...
In times of sickness and in health,

261
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,136
In times of sickness and in health,

262
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,161
and when others may abandon her...

263
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,904
They're here!

264
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,810
Yuki, this way!

265
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,518
Let's go, Kaori!

266
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,554
After them! Don't let them get away!

267
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,849
Split up and look for them!

268
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,679
Yes, Sir!

269
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,262
One down.

270
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,302
You think you're hiding? Die!

271
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,177
Damn, it's just the veil.

272
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,479
Over here!

273
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,446
Hi!

274
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,180
Good work.

275
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,583
You aren't Tsubaki Yamaoka. A stand-in?

276
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,643
You've given us a lot of trouble,
but this is it.

277
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,677
Throw down your gun!

278
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,678
Don't do it, Ryo!

279
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,112
I don't care what happens to me,
just get this bastard!

280
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,118
I can't do that.

281
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,815
It'd be awful if that three million yen
dress got a hole in it.

282
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,862
That's true.

283
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,332
It'd be awful if we harmed such
an expensive dress...

284
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,436
What?! That's just great! I'm not even
worth three million yen, am I?!

285
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,771
Hey, stop that!
What?! That's just great! I'm not even
worth three million yen, am I?!

286
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:33,305
What?! That's just great! I'm not even
worth three million yen, am I?!

287
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,673
You bastard!

288
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,140
Let go!

289
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,976
Kaori!

290
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,944
Kaori! You okay?!

291
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,892
Ryo, I'm sorry. The dress... The dress...

292
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,588
You idiot! Who gives a damn
about the dress?!

293
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,988
Oh, I'm all right.

294
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,495
I see. I'm so relieved.

295
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,168
Ryo...

296
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,417
Take us to your client.

297
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,146
Mando Nakata

298
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,422
You idiots! You failed again?!

299
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,552
We're quitting this job! We'll give you
back the money, so...

300
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,929
You cowards! Get out of here!

301
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,227
Yes, Sir, you don't need to tell us that.

302
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,497
Damn it. I'll hire someone top notch,
no matter what it costs me!

303
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,073
Hello? This is Nakata.

304
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,698
What?!

305
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:47,346
Don't mess with Umino Shipping or
Yamaoka Shipping anymore.

306
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,177
That is, if you want to live longer.

307
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,184
What kind of foolishness is this?

308
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,019
Cigars aren't good for you.

309
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,647
What?! Who the hell are you?!

310
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,768
It isn't as if you have long to live.


311
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,599
No need to hurry to your grave.

312
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,962
Wasn't Tsubaki beautiful at her wedding?

313
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,301
I guess by now, they're on an airplane,
headed for Europe.

314
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,106
Snow! It's snow, Ryo!

315
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,385
No wonder it's so cold.

316
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,255
Oh, yeah! There's no present
for you this year!

317
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:08,090
Thanks to getting that dress full of holes,
we're in debt again!

318
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,085
No, I don't need one. I already
got my present.

319
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:17,325
Thank you for worrying more
about me than the dress.

320
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,205
No present could have made me happier.

321
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,638
A white Christmas?

322
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,150
Flying through the sunrise

323
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,121
Searching for the sunset

324
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:57,465
Changing the color of my lipstick
doesn't excite me anymore

325
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:02,911
Because its color is far from that of dreams

326
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:11,187
A journey to see a sunrise
like a ball of fire

327
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:16,628
If I could invite you too

328
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:25,935
I would take to the sky like a feather

329
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:34,179
If I can become passionate,
that's all I want

330
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:42,518
An invisible sun will surely rise in my heart

331
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:50,485
I want to gaze upon something grand

332
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:57,002
Even my bit of courage goes barefoot

333
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:02,133
And runs away

334
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,915
A broker for sweepers came looking for us!
We're so lucky!

335
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,218
If Miss Sophie likes us, we'll never
have to miss another meal!

336
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,619
Something's not right here.

337
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,656
Why does Sophie care about the gun
Robert left when he died?

338
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,157
It just happens to be the day Robert died.

339
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,226
And someone is after Sophie.

340
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,028
It does all seem a little choreographed.

341
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,663
I wonder who she really is?

342
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,131
City Hunter 3:

343
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,501
"Goodbye City - A Farewell Gift (Part 1)"

344
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,332
It'll be goodbye to you if you don't watch.
