1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,608
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
One can a day
Careful, don't drink too much!
Hi
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,482
Frustration comes knocking on my door

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,319
Wolves that can't run

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,156
Wander around, clawing at the darkness

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,455
The last time I saw you

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
Was in the dusty crowds

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,401
Your accusing gaze

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,667
Left an ache in my back as I walked away

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,877
The roadway has been blocked by fog

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,680
Even now, I'm still looking for the answer

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,446
In the clueless night sky

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,388
The horizon stretches out

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, a sky
without constellations

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, a path
without common sense

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,244
Wow, wow, wow, seeking only kindness

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,907
Wow, wow, wow, facing loneliness

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,075
Wow, wow, wow, I don't need you like that

28
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,303
I could never wear such a bold, high-leg
suit in front of people.

29
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,362
But you just happen to be in front
of another person.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,309
It isn't fair of you to hide
such a splendid figure.

31
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:29,149
You have a trim, streamlined body.

32
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,584
It's like high-leg swimsuits
were made just for you.

33
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,108
Well...

34
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,788
I'm no one to be suspicious of.

35
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:40,393
I came here to escape the din of the world
and find a moment of peace...

36
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,451
What?!

37
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:49,402
I tried a suave routine, unlike my usual
approach, but it didn't work either!

38
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,131
Ryo's going to be depressed now!

39
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:57,398
Love is Diving!
When a Beauty Puts On a Swimsuit

40
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,879
What are you doing?! Please let me go!

41
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,403
Come with us for a bit.

42
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,444
Who's there?!

43
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,089
Pick-up lines sure have become
extreme these days.

44
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,182
Using force to sweet-talk a girl?

45
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,194
You making fun of us?!

46
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,059
Don't mess with us!

47
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,123
Bastard!

48
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,168
Just you remember this!

49
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,969
Jeez, isn't there anything else
they could've said?

50
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,514
You aren't hurt, are you?

51
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,749
Well, thank you very much.

52
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:37,517
Oh, hey...

53
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,984
I'm sorry!

54
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,353
Oh, why?

55
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,592
Saeko!

56
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,184
What?! Ryo?!

57
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,899
Oh, my, I'm sorry. I couldn't
stop my momentum.

58
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,068
Why are you here?

59
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,504
Sorry, but I don't have time to explain. Later!

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,873
What? Why? What's going on?

61
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,746
Ryo, how late are you going to stay in bed?!

62
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,213
It's already lunchtime!


63
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,349
There's a client here, so make
yourself presentable.

64
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,091
Ryo, this is our client, Miss Ayano.

65
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,356
Woo-hoo, the client's a girl!

66
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,763
You are...

67
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,288
Have we met somewhere?

68
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,061
Well, thank you very much for last night.

69
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,530
I didn't recognize you since your
hair's different from last night.

70
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,977
You two know each other?

71
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,912
It's Miss Mokkori-High-Leg that
I met at the hotel pool!

72
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,552
What's with this change in attitude?
A female client?

73
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,454
Saeba Firm's finances won't allow us
to pick and choose clients.

74
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,560
So, you're a researcher.

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,895
Yes...

76
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,866
I work aboard Professor Jean Louis
Thoreau's underwater research vessel.

77
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,634
Jean Louis?

78
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,436
He's the Frenchman famous for
his production

79
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,305
of underwater documentary films, right?

80
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,709
After we completed our research
of the Hawaiian Islands,

81
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,111
the research vessel was raided
while we were at anchor.

82
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,281
The culprit who raided the research vessel

83
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,184
did it in search of something he
couldn't find in Hawaii.

84
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:23,489
That can't be possible. We only did
some fundamental research.

85
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,159
Say, Miss Ayano, we're about to have lunch.

86
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,493
Would you like to join us?

87
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,497
Oh, no, I have work to do, so
I'll be going back now.

88
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,366
Well, in any case, leave it all up to me!

89
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,993
Relax as if you were on a big ship!

90
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,961
I just hope it isn't a pirate ship.

91
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,344
The Laetitia, this is it.

92
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,983
Hey, Mister, do you know where Ayano is?

93
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,450
Mister?


94
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,290
You must be that unique detective
that Ayano was talking about.

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,859
Oh? How did you know about me?

96
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,759
Could it be that you're...

97
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,930
I am Jean Louis Thoreau.

98
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,966
Nice to meet you! I'm his partner,
Kaori Makimura.

99
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,068
You are?

100
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,663
To think that a beautiful lady like you
is a detective's partner.

101
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,774
Kaori is...

102
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,741
Beautiful?

103
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,843
Looks like Ayano has come back just in time.

104
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,152
Mr. Saeba!

105
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,558
Darn, I guess she's not wearing her
high-leg swimsuit today.

106
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,220
Ayano doesn't own any high-leg swimsuits.

107
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,402
Wow, you look used to doing this.

108
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,996
Of course, it's part of my job.

109
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,237
The wetsuit isn't bad either!

110
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,207
Usually this is about when Kaori's
hammer comes flying.

111
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,188
Exactly!

112
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,749
There are many French dishes
that use seafood as well.

113
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,126
I see.

114
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,595
Jean Louis has a quick hand
when it comes to women,

115
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,532
so you'll lose Miss Kaori if you
don't guard her well.

116
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,033
That's perfectly fine with me.

117
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,503
I'd love nothing better than for them
to take nitro-girls like her

118
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,370
and sink them in the Japan Deep
or something.

119
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,207
Now, I'm not going to lose either. Mokkori!

120
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,973
I'm sorry!

121
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,950
Noisy bastard.

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,941
Are you worried about Monsieur Saeba?

123
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,255
Me? No way!

124
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,225
The one I'm worried about is Miss Ayano.

125
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,716
I'm worried that she might fall prey
to Ryo's poisonous bite.

126
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,025
Her lover is the ocean.

127
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,137
She doesn't know how to love
anything other than that.

128
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,971
That's why her defensive instincts
keep men away at such times.

129
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,974
I'm so stupid.

130
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm sorry for panicking over
such a trivial thing.

131
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,952
I think you're overdoing it.

132
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,855
What am I, an invalid who can't even walk?


133
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:13,019
But you know, if something like this always
shocks you, you'll never fall in love.

134
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
I've always been like that.

135
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,333
Every time a chance comes my way,

136
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,996
I become afraid at the enormousness
of it and run away.

137
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:42,913
Mr. Saeba...

138
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,958
You went to the trouble of buying
a fashionable swimsuit,

139
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,328
so don't be shy and learn to
wear it boldly in public.

140
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,866
I don't have the courage to
wear it in public, so...

141
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:58,304
You must have seen many mystical sights,
diving in the Seven Seas.

142
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:02,468
But something even more miraculous
happens between a man and a woman.

143
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,044
Mr. Saeba...

144
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:09,348
And in that crucial moment, work up your
courage and take one more step forward.

145
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,816
Work up my courage and
take one more step...

146
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,651
That's right.

147
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,420
Be brave.

148
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,098
Really! What a troublesome bastard!

149
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:30,136
You did something weird again when
no one was looking, didn't you?

150
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,603
You idiot!

151
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,534
Miss Kaori, Mr. Saeba didn't do...

152
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,843
I'm sorry you had to see that.

153
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,378
Even though you've hired him
as a bodyguard,

154
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,676
you can't let your guard down
around that man.

155
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,518
That was true in the beginning,
but just now...

156
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,952
I felt like I learned something very important.

157
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,856
Is that so?

158
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,517
But I know what you're really thinking.

159
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,428
Just one more step to mokkori.

160
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,309
Oh, here's the marine chart drafting
graphics system

161
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,277
that we've been waiting on for so long.

162
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,250
Merci! We've been expecting you!

163
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,686
Now we can do more detailed research
than we could before.

164
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,857
This looks rather light.

165
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,917
Hey, is this really what I ordered?

166
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,631
Are you not satisfied with this?

167
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,532
Who are you men?!

168
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,367
Mr. Thoreau!

169
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,834
Don't move!

170
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,537
Do not lay a hand on this mademoiselle!

171
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,198
She has nothing to do with this!

172
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,300
At this rate, our positions will be reversed.

173
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,110
Where's the other girl?!

174
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,252
Yo, we meet again.

175
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,555
I almost didn't recognize you guys
dressed the way you are.

176
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,858
You're the guy from...

177
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,826
Damn it! Kill him!

178
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,700
Mr. Thoreau!

179
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,302
I once fought in the resistance.

180
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,793
I'm capable of protecting a beauty.

181
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,442
This is bad. Stay here and don't move!

182
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,909
Mr. Saeba!

183
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,788
What a bastard!

184
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,301
Persistent bunch.

185
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,670
What could they be after?

186
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,833
Why? Why me?

187
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,446
Ayano, Saeba is a pro.

188
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,582
He will fully protect us until we leave
port the day after tomorrow.

189
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,049
Let's put our trust in him.

190
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,886
Until we leave port the day after tomorrow...

191
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,548
The day after tomorrow, I'll say
goodbye to Mr. Saeba.

192
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,012
The real graphics system is finally here!

193
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,788
Miss Kaori, would you connect
the cables over there?

194
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,551
Okay, got it.

195
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,724
But which one could it be?

196
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,394
Now, the cables over there.

197
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,589
Okay, leave it up to me.

198
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,056
And now, the main cable...

199
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,243
All right! It's on!

200
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,878
Thank you, Miss Kaori.

201
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,642
Now, we can set out to research the ocean.

202
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,813
Well, Mr. Thoreau?

203
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,221
You travel all over the world with
Miss Ayano, just the two of you.

204
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,655
Why don't you have any interest in her?

205
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:13,959
In Ayano?

206
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,629
She is a partner in my work.

207
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,732
Besides, she hasn't become a
full-fledged woman yet.

208
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,734
Her feminine charms still have
a long way to go.

209
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,572
Really? She's very beautiful and
her sweet personality...

210
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,041
The way you think of others...

211
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,211
I think Japanese women are wonderful.

212
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,111
But...

213
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,472
Say! Speaking of Ayano, I haven't
seen her around today.

214
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,388
Ayano's been shut up in
her room since noon.

215
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,224
She seemed to be turning her
closet upside down.

216
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:49,228
If you're going to be a bodyguard, you
should know where everyone is!

217
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,332
Well, I'd like to travel the Seven Seas
in my old age too,

218
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,267
but with an assistant like Ayano. Not like her.

219
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,003
Old age?

220
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,942
When I was your age,

221
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:07,072
there were beauties at every port in the world
who were far more beautiful than Ayano!

222
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,081
Wow!

223
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,548
Impressive!

224
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,119
Mr. Saeba...

225
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,255
Ayano, that dress...

226
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,525
Yes, since we'll be departing
Japan tomorrow,

227
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,962
I wanted to show my gratitude to Mr. Saeba
for being our bodyguard.

228
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:27,199
I'd like to invite him to dinner at a
restaurant on a ship just ahead.

229
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,667
My, my.

230
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,763
Well, Mr. Saeba, will you
accept my invitation?

231
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,210
Of course, I'll be happy to accept.

232
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,780
That bastard! He gets to have all the fun!

233
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,180
I'll never accept a female client again!

234
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,152
Mademoiselle Kaori,

235
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:52,024
I would like to cook some seafood
for you, aboard this vessel.

236
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,859
Will you accept?

237
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,918
Yes! Gladly!

238
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,206
To the future success of the Laetitia.

239
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,940
And to your own new journey.

240
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,390
Looks like she's safe so far.

241
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,326
The question is when will Ryo
reveal his true nature.

242
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,793
It'll be fine.

243
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,095
To think that Ayano invited a man to dinner...

244
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:38,601
It's nothing to a normal girl, but for her,
it's great progress.

245
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,943
Well, let's leave Ayano to him.
Please try my seafood cooking.

246
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,934
Wow, it looks delicious!

247
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,296
Well, thank you for the food!

248
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,423
A date with a beauty sure gets
the appetite going.

249
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,995
You really seem to enjoy your meals.

250
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,305
Really? Then maybe I'll order
just one more dish.

251
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,500
Yes, please help yourself.

252
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,543
What will I order next?

253
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,882
You had that necklace on at
the pool too, didn't you?

254
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,518
Yes, it's my favorite.

255
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,386
And since I was wearing it
when I first met you...

256
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,403
Shoot! They got there first!

257
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,843
Mr. Saeba!

258
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,441
It's those guys again!

259
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,789
All right! Here we go!

260
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,633
Saeko!

261
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,837
Bastard!

262
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,212
It's all he can do to keep up.

263
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,863
As long as she's with me,
he can't shoot freely.

264
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:00,912
Mr. Saeba...

265
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,920
Oh, no! Get away!

266
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,136
Ayano!

267
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,412
Ryo! Leave this up to me!
You save Miss Ayano!

268
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,464
Damn it! Take this!

269
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,603
I missed!

270
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,671
Kaori, reload! Reload!

271
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,467
Right!

272
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,911
Mr. Saeba...

273
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,200
Did you see that?!

274
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,937
It takes more than one, two, three, or
four choppers to mess with me!

275
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,705
Well, I guess we'll leave it at that.

276
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,173
Now, how's Ryo doing?

277
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,060
Hey, looks like you're awake.

278
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,225
Mr. Saeba, you were kissing me...

279
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,869
Oh, no, you were unconscious,

280
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,837
so I was performing mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation, you see?

281
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,540
You shameless bastard!

282
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,310
Are you going to tarnish even the
romanticism of the ocean?!

283
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,477
Divine retribution!

284
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,536
You got it all wrong!

285
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,708
They were after the necklace
Miss Ayano is wearing?

286
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,255
Where did you get this?

287
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,459
When we were researching
the Hawaiian Islands,

288
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,261
I accidentally found it in a shipwreck.

289
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,966
You just happened to find something
belonging to an assassinated spy.

290
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,602
The week before you went diving,

291
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,304
a spy stole secrets from an
American bio-company

292
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,640
and his yacht was blown up.

293
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,076
Then, the people who came after her are...

294
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,740
An international criminal organization:
Black Widow.

295
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,348
Look!

296
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,621
It gives me the shivers to think

297
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,146
that Black Widow might have gotten
hold of such information.

298
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:03,428
So, you were following them all this time and
mistook me for one of them at the hotel.

299
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:08,263
But I never knew that you were
involved in all of this.

300
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,004
You were watching when they came in
disguised as workers

301
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,006
and attacked the Laetitia.

302
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,099
Oh, you knew that?

303
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,211
It was fun, Mademoiselle Kaori.

304
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,280
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

305
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,444
Monsieur Saeba, if it were possible,
I'd have liked to trade assistants.

306
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:29,187
Actually, I was sort of thinking
the same thing.

307
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:29,988
Ryo!

308
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,757
Papa! How could you?!

309
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,726
I've always told you not to call me that!

310
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,455
Papa?!

311
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,097
I was once known as the
Don Juan of the sea!

312
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,766
I'll never be popular with the women

313
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,563
if it gets to be known that I have
such an old daughter!

314
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,203
I guess it's safe if they're family.

315
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,228
The mystery's finally solved.

316
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,813
Goodbye! Take care!

317
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,644
Goodbye!

318
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,455
Mr. Saeba was such a wonderful person,

319
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,685
and Miss Kaori too.

320
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,127
They were a very refreshing pair.

321
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,964
Next time we come to Japan,
I will make Miss Kaori mine.

322
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,001
Ayano, go capture Monsieur Saeba's heart.

323
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,060
Papa!

324
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,140
There they go.

325
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,500
Say, Kaori?

326
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,278
You'd have been popular too if only
you'd been born in France!

327
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,312
What did you say?!

328
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,852
Stop right there!

329
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,150
Flying through the sunrise

330
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,121
Searching for the sunset

331
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:57,431
Changing the color of my lipstick
doesn't excite me anymore

332
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:02,878
Because its color is far from that of dreams

333
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:11,153
A journey to see a sunrise
like a ball of fire

334
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,595
If I could invite you too

335
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:25,902
I would take to the sky like a feather

336
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:34,146
If I can become passionate,
that's all I want

337
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:42,485
An invisible sun will surely rise in my heart

338
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:50,451
I want to gaze upon something grand

339
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:56,968
Even my bit of courage goes barefoot

340
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:02,099
And runs away

341
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,514
It's quite a feat to hire an assistant
when you don't have a job.

342
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:13,418
She pushed me into it. Hitomi just
adores detectives.

343
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,888
But that's no reason to make her
wear a miniskirt, Mr. Mokkori.

344
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,458
Actually, she's gotten involved in a case.

345
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,060
So, we should help her out, Kaori Sempai.

346
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,027
Sempai?!

347
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,564
You can count on me!

348
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,565
City Hunter 3:

349
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,632
"Who the Heck is Ryo?

350
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,568
Even the College Girl is Smitten
with the Thrill"

351
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,399
You'll be smitten if you don't watch.
