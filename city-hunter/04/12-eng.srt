Break away from yesterday

Give me a shock, for the
satisfaction of the era.

31
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:47,506
Clumsy tricks will only bring
everyone to grief.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,722
Hey, Ryo, you're drinking too much.

33
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,392
No way! Ryo's not dwunk at all!

34
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,062
Hey, Umi, there're no more drinks!

35
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,665
Miki, Kasumi, c'mon over here!

36
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,098
Jeez...

37
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,437
There we go!

38
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:21,841
Hey, wait, Umi! It's on me. Drink up.

39
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,044
Oh! Miki, Kasumi, let's have a toast!

40
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,413
Saeba, are you really okay?

41
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,315
I'm okay! I'm okay!

42
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,782
Cheers!

43
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,056
Ryo, that's enough already.

44
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,960
Why?! I was just having fun!

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,197
I'm gonna change scenes and
go drink some more!

46
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,858
Hey, Ryo!

47
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,568
Leave him alone.

48
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,230
Today's a special day for him, isn't it?

49
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,669
Goodbye City

Robert, let's party!

51
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,990
All right, here we go!

52
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,893
I'll be waiting there ahead of you...

53
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,697
Robert!

54
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,051
That's right, today is the day
Robert passed away.

55
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,592
It's not anyone's fault.

56
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,119
It's the result of two pros fighting with
their pride and guts on the line.

57
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,023
But he can't forget his friends.

58
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,095
He's too kind.

00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,734
Kabuki Town Block 1

60
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,648

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,100
One, two! One, two! One, two! Mokkori!

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,104
One, two, mokkori! Mokkori!

64
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:10,303
One, two! One, two! One, two,
mokk... mokk...

65
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,484
Ryo...

66
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:44,943
He's not there!

67
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,644
What's the big idea, ever since yesterday?

68
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:54,450
I'm in a really bad mood right now.
Let's hear your answer.

69
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,026
What?! You have something against me?!

70
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:17,633
I think we should first have an
international goodwill mokkori!

71
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,639
We can talk after that.

72
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,381
Damn it! I was worried, and here you are!

73
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,941
American Private Detective Association
general manager, Sophie Silverman.

74
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,942
Nice to meet you.

75
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,912
American Private Detective?

76
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,350
You mean that famous brokerage
firm for sweepers?!

77
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,853
Correct. I accept jobs from clients,

78
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:05,085
and then I pass them along to the person
best suited for the job.

79
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,162
City Hunter's name is known
in America as well.

80
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:13,032
I'd love to become his agent in America.

81
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,535
I will, of course, select the jobs carefully.


82
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:20,940
We did it! We did it, Ryo! Now we can
become world famous too!

83
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,704
We'll never have to worry about
missing another meal!

84
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,538
Hey, it's okay, right? Right?

85
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,950
The way you look at me
just really bothers me.

86
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,257
He's a little out of it right now
with a hangover.

87
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,122
Please don't mind him.

88
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,263
There is one condition regarding
the contract.

89
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,765
Condition?

90
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,359
I'd like to see him work.

91
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,403
Well, of course,

92
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,304
I need to know the performance of
the machine in order to sell it.

93
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,311
See him work? I hope it'll be all right.

94
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,041
If possible, I'd like to be in close
contact for observation.

95
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,039
Close contact?

96
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,419
All right! With that condition, I'll accept!

97
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,221
Let us immediately get into close contact.

98
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:08,955
Hey!

99
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,423
Come on now, close contact, close contact.

100
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,216
Ah, Ryo!

101
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,628
Don't you leave your partner behind,
you bastard!

102
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:33,506
This is bad. If she sees his true nature,
we can forget about the contract.

103
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,971
Ryo!

104
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,584
Who are they?

105
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:43,356
Ryo's Fan Club, I'm practically
an idol in this town.

106
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,654
Okay, if you want my autograph,
line up, line up.

107
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,960
I don't care about your autograph! Pay us!

108
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,796
That's right! We came to collect on
the tabs you've accumulated.

109
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,732
We won't let you get away today!

110
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,858
Pay your tab!

111
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,792
What the heck are you doing?!

112
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:18,024
That's it, I'm taking the amount we used to
pay the debts from your monthly allowance.

113
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,491
Okay!

114
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,798
The client writes "XYZ" on
this message board.

115
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:29,063
I check the message and decide whether
to accept the job or not.

116
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,238
In other words, you're his agent.

117
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,739
Well, I guess so.

118
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,263
And what's the relationship
between the two of you?

119
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,378
We're only business partners.

120
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,680
That's right.

121
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,171
Really? You have no romantic
feelings for each other?

122
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,051
Vomit!

123
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,144
Vomit for me too!

124
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,056
The conditions are right though.

125
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:54,293
The best way for a man and a woman to
get together is to become partners.

126
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,591
More so if the job is dangerous.

127
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,057
Is that speaking from your own experience?

128
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,503
Who's the client?

129
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:09,742
Let's see, a stranger is stalking her lately,
and she's beginning to feel threatened.

130
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,937
She's a college student who was
chosen to be Miss Body Con.

131
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,247
Who is it?

132
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,116
I told you, Miss Body Con.

133
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,243
Turn that job down right away!

134
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,921
What are you so worked up about?!

135
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,591
You're acting weird. She's just the
type of client you prefer.

136
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,362
A trivial job like that won't show off
my true talent!

137
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:33,890
That's not true. Every job reveals
a man's true character.

138
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,368
But...

139
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,335
What?

140
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,671
Is there something bad about this?

141
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,206
No, well...

142
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,442
In any case, this is not the time
to be picky about work!

143
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,344
I've already accepted it, so quit complaining!

144
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,311
Yes, Ma'am.

145
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,684
What's with the shades?

146
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,245
Just thought I'd act sort of cool, you know?

147
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,717
Miss Midoriko Sayama?

148
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,021
You're City Hunter?

149
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,400
It was about a week ago when I first noticed.


150
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,903
Everywhere I go, this man appears.

151
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,471
What has he done to you?

152
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,237
He's just really persistent, always
hanging around me.

153
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,349
No!

154
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,427
At this rate, I won't even be able
to sleep without worrying!

155
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,896
Definitely a weirdo.

156
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,032
What are the characteristics of this man?

157
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:17,036
Well, he's rather tall, about 190 centimeters.

158
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,138
I think he tends to look thinner
when he's dressed,

159
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,868
because he was rather muscular
when I saw him at the pool.

160
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,879
His hair is neither long nor short.

161
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,048
His mouth is always warped into a leer,

162
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,117
and his eyes are those of a pervert.

163
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,085
He wears a sports jacket with
the sleeves rolled up

164
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,787
and a T-shirt on the inside.

165
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,591
Don't worry, I'll subjugate this
weirdo immediately!

166
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,992
Thank you!

167
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,993
Ryo!

168
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,161
Yes?

169
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,562
Hey, where are you going?!

170
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,165
Did that weirdo look like this?

171
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,533
Yes, he did.

172
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,797
Sit down!

173
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,896
I'll have your head!

174
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,879
Wow! You caught him already!

175
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,938
Now I can go on with my life
without worrying anymore.

176
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,117
Thank you very much!

177
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,175
Not at all.

178
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,246
You're welcome.

179
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,698
That's definitely Sophie.

180
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,504
Wait, Serano.

181
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,505
Why?

182
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,066
The President's orders are to kill Sophie
as soon as we find her.

183
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,379
The man with her...

184
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,939
I'm pretty sure that's City Hunter.

185
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,016
What?


186
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,297
Here you go, please make
yourself at home here.

187
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,764
Thank you.

188
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,467
Then, please excuse me, good night.

189
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,433
Why do I have to lower myself like this?!

190
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,706
It's all because of that Mr. Mokkori!

191
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,640
Have mercy!

192
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,819
No, think hard about what you've done!

193
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:18,057
If a story like that ever gets out,
we'll never get another job again!

194
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:24,730
I'm sorry! Oh, God! Oh, Buddha!
Oh, Kaori! Please let me down!

195
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,096
Damn you, how many times do we
have to go through this?!

196
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,632
In the end, I can never resist
the temptation of mokkori.

197
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,035
Sophie!

198
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,502
What?

199
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,950
I can't say that I approve of your hobby.

200
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,043
Poking your nose into people's secrets.

201
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,518
Do you have an interest in that gun?

202
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,493
Not particularly, but I do know how to fire it.

203
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,299
You point it at the person you want
to kill and pull the trigger.

204
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,846
Walther P38...

205
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,255
This will be the second time I've seen
its muzzle pointed at me.

206
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:38,189
What happened to the person who
pointed it at you the first time?

207
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,097
Sorry, but of all these guns, I don't want
this one touched by others.

208
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,480
Ryo?

209
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,848
Yes?

210
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,918
Last night, weren't you supposed to be
on the roof repenting your deeds?

211
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,286
Why are you here?

212
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:05,591
What? Well, I just went for a late night walk.

213
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,994
Unbelievable! You better not have done
anything weird to Miss Sophie!

214
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,986
I swear to God that I didn't!

215
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,092
Miss Sophie, was everything really all right?

216
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,568
We were alone together in a small room.

217
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,405
Well, that is true, but...

218
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,848
What are your plans for today?

219
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,711
I will observe your work, of course.

220
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,372
I don't see any signs of City Hunter.

221
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,135
All right, let's do it.

222
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,645
Kaori, enough is enough! Untie me!

223
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,705
No, you will stay there and repent
your deeds all day.

224
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,823
What in the world's going on?!

225
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:11,949
Untie me, Kaori!

226
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,728
What is this?!

227
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,647
Damn!

228
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,220
Die!

229
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,438
Do Not Enter

230
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,255
Are you hurt, Miss Sophie?

231
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,688
I'm all right.

232
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,081
It looks like we lost them somehow, but...

233
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,518
Miss Sophie, do you have any idea
why they would target you?

234
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,729
Here they come.

235
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,089
What a persistent bunch.

236
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,170
Stay here. I'll do something about it.

237
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,538
There are two of them.

238
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,373
I'll be okay.

239
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,965
I think...

240
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:36,068
You can't use a gun with your
right hand shot up.

241
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,135
Ryo!

242
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,105
Leave this to me. You take care of her.

243
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,265
All right!

244
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,200
Damn!

245
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,020
Gotcha!

246
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,840
You thought I'd fall for a rudimentary
trick like that?

247
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,045
You've seen too many movies,
B-movies at that.

248
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:29,149
Damn it, I won't forget this!

249
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,430
Miss Sophie?

250
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,000
Miss Sophie?

251
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,290
It's loaded.

252
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,559
What's this about?

253
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,088
This gun has been waiting for me to use it!

254
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,028
To avenge its former owner!

255
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,083
Flying through the sunrise

256
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,087
Searching for the sunset

257
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:57,299
Mou kuchibeni kaete mo tokimekanai no yo

258
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:02,744
Yume no iro ni wa toui kara

259
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:11,020
Hi no tama no you na asahi o mini iku tabi e

260
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:16,461
Moshi anata mo sasoetara

261
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:25,768
Hane no you ni maiagaruwa sora e

262
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:34,012
Atsuku naretara sore de ii

263
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:42,351
Kono mune ni kitto mienai hi ga noboru

264
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:50,318
Ookina mono o mitsumetai

265
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:56,835
Chiiisana tsuyogari mo hadashi no mama

266
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:01,966
Nigete yuku yo

267
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,313
Sophie was Robert's lover!

268
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,849
But Robert doesn't want his death avenged!

269
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,717
I will accept this challenge,

270
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,986
now that Kaori has been taken as a hostage.

271
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,388
Ryo, you're not going to...

272
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,024
Sophie! I'll fight you as I promised!

273
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,160
No! There's no point in living if Ryo dies!

274
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,062
If you're going to shoot,
shoot us both together!

275
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,363
City Hunter 3:

276
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,633
"Goodbye, City - A Farewell Gift (Part 2)"

277
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,692
If you don't watch, it'll be the last episode!
