1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,608
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
One can a day
Careful, don't drink too much!
Hi
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,482
Frustration comes knocking on my door

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,319
Wolves that can't run

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,156
Wander around, clawing at the darkness

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,455
The last time I saw you

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
Was in the dusty crowds

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,401
Your accusing gaze

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,667
Left an ache in my back as I walked away

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,877
The roadway has been blocked by fog

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,680
Even now, I'm still looking for the answer

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,446
In the clueless night sky

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,388
The horizon stretches out

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, a sky
without constellations

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, a path
without common sense

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,244
Wow, wow, wow, seeking only kindness

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,048
Wow, wow, wow, facing loneliness

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,075
Wow, wow, wow, I don't need you like that

28
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,998
Another boring day.

29
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,704
The low pressure that developed here

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,508
will progress east-northeast, and
will probably advance rapidly.

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,744
Weather in the Kantou Region will most
likely gradually go downhill.

32
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,547
Wow! Mokkori weather girl!

33
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,850
Now, we are in the square in front
of Shinjuku Station

34
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,550
Megumi Amamiya
Weather Report
Now, we are in the square in front
of Shinjuku Station

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,915
Megumi Amamiya
Weather Report
for our "Everyone's a Weather
Expert" segment.

36
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,388
Today, we'll see if the saying, "It will rain
when a cat washes its face," is true.


37
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,584
Now there's a scene I want
to show that octopus.

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,728
Even the chinchillas and the shorthairs
are doing whatever they want.

39
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,194
In other words, a cat's gestures
are not reliable.

40
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,569
This was Kei Amamiya, bringing you
the weather report.

41
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,876
Sorry for the wait, Ryo.

42
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,672
What?

43
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,311
Where'd he go?

44
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:31,506
Love Forecast of Rain, Then Shine!
The Beautiful Newscaster's Umbrella of Love

45
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,725
Here, Director.

46
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,294
Okay, I'll take care of the rest.

47
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,129
I'll be leaving now.

48
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,197
Good work!

49
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,732
Be careful!

50
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,367
Kei's going home!

51
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,401
Kei!

52
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,869
Miss Kei, please wait!

53
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,637
Miss Kei!

54
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,638
Miss Amamiya!

55
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,639
Kei!

56
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,106
Please sign this!

57
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,872
Doing well as usual. I feel light!

58
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,404
Please excuse me!


59
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,188
A woman with a sheen of sweat is beautiful.

60
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,135
I'm not in the entertainment business,

61
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,504
so I won't sign anything for you.

62
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,706
If it's a sign, I already got one.

63
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,607
The bold XYZ on TV.

64
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,745
Then you're Mr. Saeba?

65
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,880
Yes...

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,318
But to hear such cold words from your lips...

67
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,549
Could it be because a cold front is coming?

68
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,823
Cold front?


69
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:50,196
I, Ryo Saeba, study the relationship between
crime, women and weather.

70
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,264
Well, I suppose you could call it
weather sociology.

71
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,061
A Weather Reader for Even
the Most Amateur
Well, I suppose you could call it
weather sociology.

72
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,503
You're interested in the weather?
Then we have a common interest.

73
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:01,407
Right, and my accepting your job
is a blessing from Heaven.

74
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,602
No, it could even be divine fate.

75
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,946
I think I could easily talk to you.

76
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,816
Wow! In that case, the sooner the better.


77
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,119
Let's go somewhere we won't be
bothered and discuss the job.

78
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,586
Come on, come on.

79
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,323
Say, Mr. Saeba?

80
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,491
Yes?

81
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,362
The typical winter pressure
pattern is breaking up.

82
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,262
Why don't you have an umbrella with you?

83
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,530
But the weather's so nice.

84
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,840
Look, the barometer's dropping
lower and lower.

85
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,074
Barometer?

86
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,242
It measures pressure.

87
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,676
It's the best way to determine local weather.

88
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,919
Shoot! It wasn't written on the cheat sheet!


89
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,455
No, wait, I am a man of sunshine!

90
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,726
Has it ever rained when I was trying
to capture a beauty?!

91
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,430
Mr. Saeba, could it be that you know
nothing about the weather?

92
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,698
Don't underestimate me!

93
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,266
Weather forecasts started when the
Meteorological Agency

94
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,701
was established in Meiji 3!

95
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,464
It was established on June 1st
of the 8th year.

96
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,806
Right, and ever since Meiji 8,

97
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,877
the accuracy of the forecasts has not
improved much beyond eighty percent!

98
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,176
In other words, weather forecasts are
wrong twenty percent of the time.

99
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,406
Look at that clear sky!

100
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,886
What?

101
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:35,993
The story of Ryo's experience is that
eighty percent of forecasts come true.

102
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,369
Mr. Saeba, it seems you still have
a lot to learn about the weather.

103
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,582
If I give up now, the name of
Mokkori Ryo will be shamed.

104
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,106
Kei!

105
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,218
I never knew that umbrellas had such a use.

106
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,401
Mr. Saeba!

107
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,200
Wow, what electrifying legs.

108
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,178
Not again.

109
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,089
Here we go. Please come on in.


110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,971
I'm so sorry that you had to
go through that for me.

111
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:49,408
Not at all, my job is to protect you
from things like that.

112
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,945
More importantly, it would be awful
if you caught a cold!

113
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,113
Take your clothes off!

114
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,484
What?! Oh, no, thank you.
I think they'll dry soon.

115
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,420
What are you hesitating for?!

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,446
It will be disastrous if you can't
appear on TV tomorrow!

117
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,690
Ryo?

118
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,391
What?! Kaori, you're here?!

119
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,099
Well, sorry for being here!

120
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,436
Here I was, wondering where you'd gone
without even eating, you bastard!

121
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,303
No! No! She's a client!

122
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,605
Client?

123
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,537
You're Miss Kei Amamiya! I'm sorry you
had to see that.

124
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,817
Kaori, hurry up and untie me.

125
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,892
Hello? Saeba Firm.

126
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,860
What? Television station?

127
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,432
Oh, yes, Miss Kei's here.
Please wait a moment.

128
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,633
For me?

129
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,659
Television stations know a lot. They learned
where you're staying.

130
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,072
Hello?

131
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,040
You still don't seem to get it.

132
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:01,603
Hiring a bodyguard won't do you any good.
I know everything.

133
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,785
If you continue to ignore my demands,

134
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,413
I can't guarantee your safety.

135
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,188
Hello? Who in the world are you?!
Why are you...

136
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,136
I've loved telling fortunes to predict
weather since I was little.

137
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,707
I'd roll a geta and predict whether
it would be rain or shine.


138
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,006
My feelings didn't change, even as
I grew into an adult.

139
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,512
That's why I went to work for a private
weather forecasting firm.

140
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,719
When I started reporting the
weather on television,

141
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,656
I introduced regional jinxes and folk-wisdom.

142
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,886
It was well received.

143
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,351
But one day, I got a threatening letter.

144
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,498
"Quit being a newscaster."

145
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,990
"Or else, strange things will begin to
happen around you."

146
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:00,640
Since then, a light fell on a staff
member during a briefing.

147
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,132
A pachinko ball hit a fan asking
for an autograph.

148
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,917
It's probably all because I won't
do as he demands,

149
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,586
but I love my work.

150
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,421
And that's why you hired us?

151
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,221
A rival colleague or someone envious
of your popularity...

152
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,461
Don't worry. Now that I'm your bodyguard,

153
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,997
you have no need to fear him anymore.

154
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:29,635
Oh, but instead, you'll teach inept
little me about the weather, okay?

155
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,171
Hey, don't take advantage of her situation!

156
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,373
How wonderful! You'll protect me,

157
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,001
and on top of it, I get to talk about
weather all day long!

158
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,880
Now that it's decided, you better not
go out again today.

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,815
I insist that you stay here tonight.

160
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,840
Okay! Thank you for having me!

161
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,644
Really?

162
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,350
Speaking of which, I hired you
because I saw this.

163
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,226
Yes!

164
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:58,629
The effort of passing out all those
fliers has finally paid off!

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,300
Is what's written here true?

166
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,302
Of course, it is.

167
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,396
I think I pass.

00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,350
I feel bad taking the hundred percent off.

174
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,789
Not at all! For you, I'll include
a special service too!

175
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,525
Special service?

176
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,857
Yup! Mokkori service!

177
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,231
You don't need to include such a service!


178
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:38,936
I don't need the mokkori service, so
thirty percent off will be fine. Yes!

179
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,739
Oh, why? Sniff...

180
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,862
Can't sleep, Kei?

181
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,902
Mr. Saeba...

182
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,905
I just can't settle down.

183
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,978
When I'm sad or worried about something,

184
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,147
I look at the night sky.

185
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,349
And it gives you a sense of peace.

186
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,145
Yes!

187
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,820
Just do something that won't
let me be at peace,

188
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,447
and you'll get the hundred percent
larger hammer.

189
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,759
The sky gently embraces all sorts of things,

190
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,557
like the sad things and the ugly things
about people.

191
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,029
And above all, it doesn't lie.

192
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,067
How's tomorrow's weather looking?

193
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,872
I won't know for sure without detailed data,

194
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,677
but the moon has a halo and the
breeze is slightly moist.

195
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,147
At times like these, I sometimes decide
by the luster of my hair.

196
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,206
Maybe it'll rain a little around
noon tomorrow too.

197
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,050
Really?

198
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,643
Even with so many stars out?

199
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,824
I guess you really like weather forecasting.

200
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,791
Yes!


201
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,090
In the city or the country, the
world's weather is my friend.

202
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:23,302
Tokyo Weather
Forecasting

203
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,183
The morning sun stings my eyes.
Ryo needs more sleep.

204
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,158
You have to study accurate data
in the morning

205
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,061
in order to do the weather
forecast at noon.

206
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,195
Really?

207
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,432
I thought only the Meteorological
Agency did things like this.

208
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,400
Even if it's only a couple minutes
of broadcast time,

209
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,164
it's an important thing that we can't
do without in everyday life,

210
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,373
Mr. Saeba, would you wait
around for a while?

211
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,207
Take your time. This place is full
of interesting things!

212
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,579
I'm glad. Now...

213
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,860
Mr. Saeba, please do not bother me.

214
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,862
Oh, did I mess up your concentration?

215
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,592
Then I'll stay quiet back here.

216
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,083
The weather is going downhill.
Please be careful.

217
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,051
Are you supposed to use keyboards like this?

218
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,336
On days like today, do not
forget your umbrella.

219
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,772
I don't think you're using the
umbrella right either.

220
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,235
Ryo can't hold back anymore!

221
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,717
This is the correct use of a hammer!

222
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,843
I'd forgotten.

223
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,751
What's that sound?!

224
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,025
It's time for exercise!

225
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,723
Wow! Could it be that storm of fans?!

226
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,098
I'm from Ueda Pro!

227
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:26,932
I'm from Suwa Agency!

228
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,661
I'm from Kobayashi Planning!

229
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,895
I've brought a good contract today!

230
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,404
Mr. Saeba, this way!

231
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,871
Right with you!

232
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,176
We won't let you escape today!

233
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,310
What the hell?!

234
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,079
Please do a recording debut with us!

235
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,047
No, please appear in our movie!

236
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,950
Looks like we underestimated her popularity.

237
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,593
Oh, boy!

238
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,668
Is every day this intense for you?

239
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,005
I'm used to it. There's too much
commotion at the office,

240
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,207
so I come here to analyze data and things.

241
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,408
I see.


242
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,138
I never knew the weather forecast
started in a place like this.

243
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:28,760
What?

244
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,397
She's so immersed in her work that
she doesn't even see me.

245
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,534
Watch out, Kei!

246
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,677
Get down!

247
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,816
That was...

248
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,626
"I've warned you many times before now,"

249
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,728
"but I won't hold back anymore."

250
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,563
"I have reached my limit."

251
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,966
"Announce your retirement
in today's broadcast,"

252
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,866
"or else I have no choice but to kill you."

253
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,803
Why?

254
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,809
The culprit has finally issued
a serious challenge.

255
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,548
It would be rude if we don't
take him seriously.

256
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:34,247
I'll need you to take some risks too.
Can you do it?

257
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,474
Miss, is it going to keep raining?

258
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,876
Well, a little longer.

259
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,741
But it'll clear up towards the afternoon.

260
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,676
Do you hate rain?

261
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,857
The northern and southern parts
of the Kantou Region,

262
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,659
as well as the northern Izu Islands,

263
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,529
will be going from rain with
a mix of sleet to shine.

264
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,699
Saitama, Kanagawa, Ibaraki,
and Gunma Prefectures

265
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,065
will probably have some clear skies
in the afternoon as well.

266
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,238
Now for "Everyone's a Weather Expert."

267
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,474
The weather is getting better,


268
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,210
but at times like this, please be
careful of car accidents.

269
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,011
According to the Kanagawa
Prefecture Police's data,

270
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,681
not only do accidents occur due to
slippery road conditions

271
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,984
when the air pressure is above ten millibars,

272
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,043
but drivers also have worse judgment.


273
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,460
On days like today, when the air
pressure changes so rapidly,

274
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,963
I feel like something scary might happen.

275
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,999
But tomorrow, we should have
clear weather all day.

276
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,466
I will see you all again tomorrow.

277
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,703
Okay, good!

278
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,169
Mr. Saeba, it's over.

279
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,375
Where did you go?

280
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,868
Mr. Saeba?

281
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,313
Looks like Mr. Bodyguard let his guard down
and went somewhere.

282
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,787
What are you doing?! Let me go!

283
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,254
Quit struggling!

284
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,924
Shut up! Do you see these?!

285
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:25,964
What's that?!

286
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,266
That can't be!

287
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,893
It's dynamite!

288
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,448
So, you're the one who's been
threatening me all this time?

289
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,783
That's right.

290
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,986
I'm the nice guy who went to all that
trouble just to warn you.

291
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,089
I warned you meticulously, over and over.

292
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,725
Is there a cameraman around?!
Cameraman?!

293
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,785
Yes, Sir, thanks for waiting.
You called for me?

294
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,360
You want me to tape you looking cool
and monopolizing Miss Kei?

295
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,601
Hey, you're pretty perceptive.

296
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:11,031
I've watched over Kei, ever since she
first appeared on television.

297
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,836
I'm nothing like the bodyguard that
hangs around her these days!

298
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,445
Well, don't get so worked up. You might
want to smile a little.

299
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,956
Like this? Or how about this?

300
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,158
You're just lacking a certain dignity.

301
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,894
Maybe if you stick out your
chest a little more.

302
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,728
How about this?

303
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,529
A little more.

304
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,129
Like this?

305
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,297
Just a little bit more.

306
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,764
Like this?!

307
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,501
Was that broadcast nationwide?

308
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,811
The dynamite you have is of no use
now that its fuse is all wet.

309
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,947
You're the bodyguard!

310
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,344
You underestimate me!

311
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,056
I've got plenty more dynamite!

312
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,364
Oh my, it's raining buckets.

313
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,858
Too bad! And now the criminal
has lost his trump card!

314
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,537
How dare you ridicule me?!

315
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,368
Don't mess with me!

316
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,187
If you do any more funny things to her,

317
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,815
you'll never get to see her
on television again.

318
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:38,263
Have mercy! I was wrong!
I won't go near her again!

319
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:42,401
Jeez, there sure are a lot of hopeless
guys out there lately.

320
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,102
Kaori, why are you here?

321
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,539
It's easy to find you when it's been
broadcasting all this time.

322
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,610
Man! The case is solved and the
sky's beginning to clear up.


323
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,145
It's beginning to clear up and what?

324
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,136
Oh, no! It's nothing important.

325
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,917
Mr. Saeba, thank you.

326
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,977
Now, I can continue to do weather
forecasts without any worries.

327
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,690
I'm glad for you, Kei.

328
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,215
Yes, it looks like the afternoon will be nice.

329
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,629
Say, Mr. Saeba?

330
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,065
Would you come with me to search
for rainbows after the rain?

331
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,767
Sure thing! I'll follow you wherever!

332
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,402
Ryo the pervert!

333
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,039
You are passing out fliers, a hundred
percent more than usual today!

334
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,041
But, Kaori!

335
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,045
Don't "but" me! Saeba Firm's motto is,
"Rain, then work."

336
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,246
Let me take a little break.

337
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,114
No!

338
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,652
Oh, Kei! Help me out here!

339
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,486
Oh, Kei! Help me out here!
Flying through the sunrise

340
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,283
Flying through the sunrise

341
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,056
Searching for the sunset

342
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:57,165
Changing the color of my lipstick
doesn't excite me anymore

343
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,611
Because its color is far from that of dreams

344
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:10,886
A journey to see a sunrise
like a ball of fire

345
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:16,328
If I could invite you too

346
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:25,635
I would take to the sky like a feather

347
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:33,879
If I can become passionate,
that's all I want

348
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:42,218
An invisible sun will surely rise in my heart

349
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:50,184
I want to gaze upon something grand

350
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:56,701
Even my bit of courage goes barefoot

351
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:01,832
And runs away

352
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,448
Why did you accept a job to split up
a couple that eloped?!

353
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,516
Because if I bring Tsubaki back,

354
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,752
I get to be in the lap of luxury with
parent-authorized mokkori!

355
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,988
It's awful that the parents forced their
disagreement on the kids,

356
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,156
but you're awful too!

357
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,391
Then what am I supposed to do?

358
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,092
Hurry up and bring her back!

359
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,195
What? Then you don't mind if I take the job?

360
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,597
Well, I already used up the
money they paid us.

361
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,698
City Hunter 3:

362
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,900
"A Wedding Dress for Christmas (Part 1)"

363
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,527
You're awful if you don't watch.
