Break away from yesterday

00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, seiza no kieta sora

00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507

Asaoka Law Firm

29
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,672
Write down whatever sum you
want on that check.

30
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,740
It's my way of expressing my gratitude.

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,112
You are truly a successful president
in the construction business.

32
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,449
But I cannot accept more than what
the bar association ordains.

33
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,987
I'm impressed by your skill, with which
you soundly defeated

34
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:05,425
the residents' lawsuit against my
building of a condominium.

35
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,428
I only defended you in a legal manner.

36
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,794
The verdict was given by a court of law.

37
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,800
I like you even more.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,802
Do you mind if I smoke?

39
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,326
May I ask you not to?

40
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:24,139
How about it? Won't you become
a little friendlier with me?

41
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,780
I hope we will be very good
business partners.

42
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,550
Miss Mei...

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,420
That's fine, but it's a tough world for
a woman to live alone in.

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,218
If you ever change your mind,
come visit me anytime.

45
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,362
He's so cheesy!

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,637
An electronic notebook?

The Greatest Flagrant Love Committed!
How to Hit on a Beautiful Lawyer

00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,314
XYZ
I will be waiting in
Central Park at
noon tomorrow.

49
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:06,217
XYZ
I will be waiting in
Central Park at
noon tomorrow.
"I will be waiting in Central Park at
noon tomorrow. Akira Asaoka."

50
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,856
Akira Asaoka? A man?

51
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,416
Ryo is going to pass!

52
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,884
So, you secretly came to see
the message board again.

53
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:21,467
Oh, my! A second straight week
with a job! And it's a man!

54
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,903
Of course, you'd better be taking this job!

55
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,407
But jobs from men are...

56
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,241
What?!

57
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,110
Nothing, I will gratefully take it.

58
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,480
Now, since we've got a job lined up,
I'm going drinking!

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,573
Oh, Ryo! Wait!

60
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,308
He's hopeless.

61
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:46,859
Love, don't go away!

62
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,522
Love! I need you, I've looked...

63
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,866
I'm drunk tonight!

64
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,632
...so long for you!

65
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,972
Don't stop the love again!

66
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,685
Who the hell fired an air gun at me?!

67
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,700
What's this prank about?

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,402
Let go! You're hurting me!

69
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,563
Your voice... You're a woman!

70
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,074
I was just testing your abilities
before I hired you.

71
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,175
Hired?!

72
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,811
It should have been written on the
message board at Shinjuku Station.

73
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,540
From Mei Asaoka.

74
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,182
Mei Asaoka... Asaoka...

75
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,218
I get it! You write "Akira" and read it "Mei"!


76
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,720
It was a girl's name!

77
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,489
You are nothing like what they say.

78
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,789
I cannot hire a sweeper who can't
even dodge a toy gun.

79
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,496
No need to rush to conclusions.

80
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,728
If you want to test my abilities,
you'll have to get to know me.

81
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,773
If you get any closer than that,
I will exercise Penal Code 36!

82
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,774
What?!

83
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,139
Legitimate self-defense!

84
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,976
I think that's aggravated assault.

85
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,855
Please don't follow me anymore!

86
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,724
It was all a mistake.

87
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,727
It's dangerous for a woman to be
out alone this late at night.

88
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,162
I'll walk you home.

89
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,790
No, thank you. I have a car.

90
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,260
Watch out! Get back!

91
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,082
They only did the tires.

92
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,415
They would've detonated the whole thing
if they wanted to kill you.

93
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:58,346
It was about three days ago when
strange things started happening.

94
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,127
Any idea who the perpetrator is?

95
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,560
No, not at all.

96
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,764
This is it, my office.

97
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,363
Asaoka Law Firm
I didn't know you were a lawyer.

98
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,471
That's strange. I turned my
light off when I left!

99
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,495
Oh, wait!

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,647
How awful.

101
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,910
Mr. Saeba?

102
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,777
Mr. Saeba, please get up! Mr. Saeba!

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,974
Before I die, I want to feel these
breasts a little more.

104
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,024
Attempted murder, illegal use of explosives,

105
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,427
breaking and entering, and
destruction of property.

106
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,562
If you list the charges,
they would be endless.

107
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,656
It looks like they're looking for
something that you have.

108
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,803
As I said before, I have no idea
who might be doing this.

109
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,204
Anything missing?

110
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,933
Just one thing.

111
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,345
This is a pair of my spare underwear.
When did you...

112
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,613
What?

113
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,850
I know! This is a tactic to cause confusion!

114
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,018
I'm innocent!

115
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,213
Guilty
You are nothing but guilty!

116
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,212
Give me the right to hire an attorney.

117
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,830
I'm home.

118
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,663
Cleaning up took all night. I'm exhausted.


119
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,574
Exhausted my ass! Coming home
in the morning with company!

120
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,511
Wait, Kaori! She's our client!

121
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,714
Oh my, a hundred ton hammer!
You're Miss Kaori, aren't you?

122
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,016
Yes! You are?

123
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,320
My name is Mei Asaoka. I am an attorney.
It is nice to meet you.

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,956
Mei Asaoka? Asaoka...

125
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,859
Then that job was for you?!

126
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,294
Last night, my office was attacked.

127
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,855
Mr. Saeba said it would be safe here.
I am sorry to bother you.

128
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,061
Same old routine as always.

129
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,004
Compliments are so embarrassing.

130
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,506
I'm not complimenting you, you moron!

131
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,643
Don't worry, Miss Mei. I'll protect you
from this mokkori man.

132
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,770
Mokkori man?

133
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,661
Miss Mei, would you like some tea?

134
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,062
Oh, thank you.

135
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,564
You didn't sleep last night, right?

136
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,533
Maybe you should rest a little.

137
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,263
Yes, but I have a lot of work piled up.

138
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,239
Being a lawyer must be tough work.

139
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,241
You have to properly defend your client,

140
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,573
no matter how bad he is, right?



141
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,744
It is not the job of a lawyer
to lessen his guilt.

142
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,852
Even bad people have rights, you know?

143
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:18,347
It's my duty as their attorney to protect
their basic human rights.

144
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,497
Wow, that's great. I admire people
like you, a career woman.

145
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,762
You know, women who do
professional work. Really!

146
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,273
Special Investigations

147
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,205
Special Investigations
Hello?

148
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,142
Ryo?!

149
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,540
What do you want?

150
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:44,383
Actually, Saeko, I just remembered
something very important.

151
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,045
Pay up the mokkori you owe me!

152
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,988
What the?

153
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,616
I'm going to hang up! I'm busy!

154
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,651
You want information on a certain attorney?

155
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,332
That's going to cost you.
That'll be three mokkori.

156
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,301
Three?! One! One!

157
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,869
No, three.

158
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,604
One!

159
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
Three!

160
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,273
Then let's take the middle and say two.

161
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,508
Very well, we have a deal.

162
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,111
And? What's the attorney's name?

163
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,578
Mei Asaoka?

164
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,207
All right, Ryo. I think I can give you
a report tomorrow.

165
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,588
Mei Asaoka...

166
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,006
Yes! Stage six clear!

167
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,702
All right, I'm on a roll!

168
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,279
Damn tough bastard!

169
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,747
Take this, and this, and this!
Bastard! How about this?!

170
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,177
All right! Lucky!

171
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,958
Oh, sorry, was it too loud?

172
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,259
No...

173
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,487
Hey, want to try it a little?

174
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,064
No, I can't...

175
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,658
Oh, come on, just a little.

176
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,232
Here, front row seating!

177
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,704
Go ahead.

178
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,606
I just...

179
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,074
Come on. There, it's starting.

180
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,151
Oh, no way!

181
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,953
I... have work to do.

182
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,986
Amusement park on a weekday, not too bad,
don't you think, Mei?

183
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,865
Well, yes.

184
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,934
Hey, Ryo, what's the big idea?

185
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,936
Suddenly bringing her to
an amusement park...

186
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,134
Never mind, never mind. Let's play
until we drop today.

187
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,310
Man, she's a target. What is he thinking?

188
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,802
Here we go!


189
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,951
Hello.

190
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,020
Okay, one coming up.

191
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,192
Ever since I was little, I always
wanted to eat cotton candy

192
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,251
without worrying about people
watching for once.

193
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,634
Well, I just thought that you might
like cotton candy and...

194
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,158
Mister, three, okay? Three.

195
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,143
Kaori, hold this for me.

196
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,746
Oh, hey! Where are you going, Ryo?

197
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,213
Toilet! Toilet!

198
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,952
Right on time.


199
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,297
Noriyuki Ikeda, President of Ikeda
Construction Company.

200
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,998
He got involved in the redevelopment
of the city,

201
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,401
and using that position, he set about
buying up prime property.

202
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,636
He appears to be making a huge profit.

203
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,800
It seems he's trying to get into politics
by using that money now.

204
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,177
Just the other day, he went to court

205
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,645
over whether he could build a condominium
on land that the government sold.

206
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,416
And the person who defended him
on that occasion was...

207
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,543
Mei Asaoka?

208
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,888
Well, that's about it on the surface,

209
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,224
but it seems he's doing a lot of
other things on the sly.

210
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,691
And...

211
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,356
Here, it's Ikeda's address.

212
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,897
He's got a huge mansion in Izu.

213
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,364
Thank you.

214
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,064
But you sure are being nice this time, Saeko.

215
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,266
Really? Well, it is two mokkori's
worth after all.

216
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,547
I wonder what's taking Mr. Saeba so long?

217
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,141
No kidding, what a long trip to the bathroom.

218
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,820
But it's been really fun today.

219
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,922
I haven't played around like this
in a long time.

220
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,692
Me too! Well, I have a ton of
free time though.

221
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:59,494
Watching you work with Mr. Saeba
makes me sort of envious.

222
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,568
You're kidding, right?

223
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:07,473
I envy you. You can work openly in
the court system as a lawyer.

224
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,940
Do you think so?

225
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:14,213
The court is where people's greed
and egos are laid bare.

226
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,015
In order to survive in there,

227
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,585
everyone wears a mask to hide
their wavering emotions.

228
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,052
Mask?

229
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,950
My mask is this fake pair of glasses.

230
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,185
I wear these and always maintain
my bold front.

231
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,662
Miss Mei...

232
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,796
Hey, over here, over here!

233
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,905
Hello!

234
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,374
Oh, don't mind us. Go on and
play with the kids.

235
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,507
Stop it! What is this?! It's an anesthetic!

236
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,553
Kaori, wake up! Kaori!

237
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,531
Ryo! Miss Mei...

238
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,032
I know. Can you stand?

239
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,500
Yeah, I'm okay.

240
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,797
All right, let's go after them!

241
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,624
Looks like you're awake.

242
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,860
I'm glad you look well.

243
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,899
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't betrayed me.

244
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,702
Mr. Ikeda! So, you're the one
who's behind all of this!

245
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,465
What in the world did I do?!

246
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,273
Still playing dumb?

247
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,504
Oh well, take your time and
think about it here.

248
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,601
My, what tight security.

249
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,446
There!

250
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,617
Bye-bye! Do well!

251
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,797
What's that?!

252
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,662
Where the heck did that come from?!

253
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,066
What's that?!

254
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,443
What the?!

255
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,791
Looks like it's started.

256
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,341
Yo, how've you been?

257
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,742
Mr. Saeba, how did...

258
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,478
Hold on, no time to explain now.

259
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,002
Let's get out of here.

260
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,609
Mr. Saeba, you've committed breaking
and entering and assault.

261
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,886
You can't fight my enemies
with the statute books.

262
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:53,091
There's something more important than
words between a man and a woman.

263
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,098
That's feelings.

264
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,934
That's as far as you go, Mr. Bodyguard.

265
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:04,768
It looks like all you can do is
rub me the wrong way.

266
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,346
What's that guy talking about?

267
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,947
I have no idea.

268
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,717
Mei, this is goodbye for us too.

269
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,448
I hope we can be better friends
when you're reborn.

270
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,758
What's with him? Let's go!

271
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:43,182
This just might be the City Hunter's
greatest crisis.

272
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,149
Mr. Saeba!

273
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,219
Looks like we're in a bad fix.

274
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,957
Mr. Saeba...

275
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,227
Just kidding!

276
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,958
See you later, alligator! In a while, crocodile!

277
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,638
There's more where that came from!

278
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,105
Yes?

279
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,136
This is where your unseasonable
fireworks show ends.

280
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,479
Ryo!

281
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,314
Hey!

282
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,363
Stay away!

283
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,329
He's dodging the bullets!

284
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,607
Monster!

285
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,876
Your game is up.

286
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,883
Now...

287
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,487
What?!

288
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,970
Hi, Ryo. Good work.

289
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,406
Saeko!

290
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,908
You used me again, didn't you?!

291
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,579
Oh, but you're the one who
used my information.

292
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,916
I was only continuing my investigation
to gain evidence

293
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,352
in support of the flow of money recorded
in Ikeda's notebook.

294
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,922
That notebook...

295
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:36,128
Yes, it's the notebook you brought
to us as a lost item.

296
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,763
What?!

297
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,789
I just didn't know anything about it,
and since it was left behind,

298
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,327
I took it to the police.

299
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,808
I see! That's what Mr. Ikeda was looking for!

300
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,002
You know...

301
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,145
Thank you, Ryo.

302
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,847
Thanks to your rampage, we have
on him kidnapping,

303
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,050
illegal possession of a firearm, etc.

304
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,211
We have plenty of perfectly good charges
to bring against him now!

305
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:16,928
Mr. Saeba, from now on, I'll take my mask off
and go back to being truer to myself.

306
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:22,003
Good, but you have one other mask
you should remove.

307
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,909
The mask of love between a
man and a woman.

308
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,804
I wonder if this counts as an
extenuating circumstance?

309
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,520
One shot for the guilty!

310
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,956
Why is it that you can't dodge hammers?

311
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,720
Ryo doesn't get it either!

312
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:57,566
Mou kuchibeni kaete mo tokimekanai no yo

313
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:03,011
Yume no iro ni wa toui kara

314
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:11,287
Hi no tama no you na asahi o mini iku tabi e

315

Atsuku naretara sore de ii

Kono mune ni kitto mienai hi ga noboru

319

Chiiisana tsuyogari mo hadashi no mama

Nigete yuku yo

322
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,382
I'm living the sweet newlywed life with
Kanako, so don't bother me.

323
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,384
What?! You got married?!
When in the world?!

324
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,187
Just kidding! She's a super rich girl,

325
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,589
so she's got a lot of suitors
after her money.

326
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,990
Ryo got there first!

327
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,091
That's the act I'm performing.

328
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,394
Don't misunderstand. It's a
perfectly good job!

329
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,596
Oh my, I mistook it for a serious marriage.

330
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,897
City Hunter 3:

331
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:26,998
"Even Kaori's Pissed!

332
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,100
Ryo & a Young Lady
~Pinch Hitter Marriage Story~"

333
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,897
I'll get married if you don't watch.
