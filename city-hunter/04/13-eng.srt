1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:08,608
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,609
One can a day
Careful, don't drink too much!
Hi
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
At 2 AM on a sleepless night

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,482
Frustration comes knocking on my door

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,319
Wolves that can't run

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,156
Wander around, clawing at the darkness

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,455
The last time I saw you

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,563
Was in the dusty crowds

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,401
Your accusing gaze

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,667
Left an ache in my back as I walked away

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,877
The roadway has been blocked by fog

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,680
Even now, I'm still looking for the answer

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,446
In the clueless night sky

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,388
The horizon stretches out

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, a sky
without constellations

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, a path
without common sense

25
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,244
Wow, wow, wow, seeking only kindness

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,048
Wow, wow, wow, facing loneliness

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,075
Wow, wow, wow, I don't need you like that

28
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,928
We did it, Ryo!

29
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,132
An American broker for sweepers wants to
make a contract with Ryo!

30
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,402
This is our chance to make the
Saeba Firm world-famous!

31
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,804
All right, we have to show off for Miss Sophie

32
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,607
even if it means letting her be in
close contact for observation.

33
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,666
She didn't come here on business.

34
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,679
She came for revenge.

35
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,909
She came to avenge Robert's death.

36
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:08,349
Goodbye City
A Farewell Gift
(Part 2)

37
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,323
So that was it after all.

38
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,894
You knew?

39
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,335
When you were gazing at Robert's gun,

40
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,236
you looked as though you'd been
reunited with a loved one.

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,843
Apparently, the American Private
Detective Association

42
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,013
does not have a manager named
Sophie Silverman.

43
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:31,317
But I have heard of a female sweeper
named Sophie Silverman,

44
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,877
who goes by the alias of Silver Panther.

45
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,519
You're right. I met Robert on a
particular job we did together.

46
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,162
He had intended to make the
job in Japan his last

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,297
and wash his hands of it all afterward.

48
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,664
But he never returned from his final job.

49
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,301
I couldn't believe it.

50
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,178
Because I'd seen with my own eyes
just how good he was.

51
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,076
He was cautious about his work,
almost to the point of cowardice.

52
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,951
He always said that it was the
ironclad rule to survival.

53
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,456
I swore on his grave

54
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,331
that I would go to Japan and,
with my own hands,

55
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,629
I would kill City Hunter, who killed Robert.

56
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,340
I was looking forward to seeing just
how skilled City Hunter was,

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,968
but I guess you can't put
your faith in rumors.

58
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,104
I'm disappointed that I slipped
past your guard so easily.

59
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:39,018
So, those guys were bait
to bring me out here.

60
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:43,284
No, they're from the Guinness Corporation,
and they're after me.

61
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,025
Guinness Corporation?

62
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:50,428
The murder agency that does everything
from training terrorists to assassinating VIPs!

63
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,665
The ones who hired Robert for the job in
Japan were the Guinness Corporation.

64
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,127
Of course, when he learned that it was a job
from Guinness, he tried to turn it down.

65
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,509
But the organization learned of my
existence and threatened Robert.

66
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,303
They told him that I would die if he refused.

67
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:12,085
There shouldn't be any reason for them
to target you anymore.

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,552
It's this.

69
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,191
Inside this is what Robert stole from them,

70
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,928
a microfilm of Guinness's
VIP assassination plot.

71
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,159
He obtained it to try and insure my safety.

72
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,768
But Guinness must have decided that
it would be safer for them

73
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,362
to steal the microfilm back
and take my life too.

74
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,468
Now, draw! Just like when you killed him!

75
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,042
I have no intentions of fighting you.

76
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,010
But I do!

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,382
I see.

78
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,350
Then I will make you want to fight.

79
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,247
Well? Feel a little more like fighting me now?

80
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,486
Sorry, but I have a policy of not
pointing guns at women.

81
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,986
We'll see how long you can
stick to your policy.

82
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,507
Miss Sophie, are you all right?!

83
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,675
Ryo!

84
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,810
What happened, Ryo?! So much blood!

85
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,312
We have to treat you right away!

86
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,802
Miss Sophie, please help me!

87
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,151
Don't worry, he won't die of
wounds like those.

88
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,277
Why don't you come with me?

89
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,789
What's going on here?

90
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,519
If you don't want Saeba to die right now,
come with me quietly.

91
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,895
Miss Sophie, what in the world...

92
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,064
If you want to get Kaori back unharmed,

93
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,266
come to where the Honboku Base used to be

94
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,702
at 0-hundred hours a week from now.

95
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:40,036
If you don't come, you will suffer
the same pain that I did.

96
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,264
The pain of being robbed of a loved one.

97
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,007
Now, let's go.

98
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,245
Ryo...

99
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,908
I wonder where Ryo's run off to?

100
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,045
I came all the way here to tell him
some good news.

101
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,240
Oh, well, next time.

102
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,587
Ryo! Don't grab me so suddenly.
I'm not ready to...

103
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,793
Ryo!

104
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,428
You're so coldhearted.

105
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,364
I guess you didn't come to pay up
on the mokkori.

106
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,525
Ryo, what happened to you?

107
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,666
I see, Sophie Silverman challenged
City Hunter to a duel.

108
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,247
That's convenient for us.

109
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,716
We'll take care of both of them
in one fell swoop.

110
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,274
Don't do anything until I get there.

111
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:07,326
If we send Sophie Silverman to her grave
and kill the City Hunter,

112
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,989
the name of the Guinness Corporation
will resound throughout the world.

113
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,501
I never thought she would act
so favorably for us.

114
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,366
Looks like things worked out in the end.

115
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,878
I wonder if Saeba will be okay?

116
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,675
He doesn't seem to be in danger of dying.

117
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,142
But why did someone as skilled as Ryo...

118
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,853
Sorry for the trouble.

119
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,911
No big deal.

120
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,958
What happened?

121
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,360
Kaori's disappeared,

122
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,852
and I hear you were seen
with Sophie Silverman.

123
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,835
News travels fast.

124
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,136
It's Saeko.

125
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,272
Apparently, people from Guinness
Corporation were acting strange,

126
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,174
so she was investigating the matter.

127
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,641
Why don't you talk?

128
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,648
Sophie Silverman was Robert's lover.

129
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,983
Robert's?

130
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,747
She challenged me to a formal duel.

131
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,950
Kaori's a hostage until then.

132
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,286
So that's it.

133
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,735
What are you going to do?

134
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,371
I have no intention of harming you.

135
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,773
I'm just going to use you
to make Saeba suffer.

136
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,308
Your hate isn't justified!

137
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,278
It's the result of two pros that fought
with everything they had!

138
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,615
Would you believe that, even if
Saeba were killed?

139
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,517
Could you just let it go?

140
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,851
That's...

141
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,353
There's no way you could understand.

142
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,789
You've never lost what you held
dearest in your heart.

143
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,124
I do understand!

144
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,726
You could never understand!

145
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,627
I do understand! I lost my older brother too!

146
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,924
I understand your feelings
of hate towards Ryo.

147
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,697
But please try to understand
how Robert felt too.

148
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,604
Robert...

149
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,039
They were good friends.

150
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,645
Robert and Saeba were?

151
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:10,383
And they had to fight each other,
because they're both pros.

152
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,850
Because they're both men!

153
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,319
Do you think that Robert hates Ryo?

154
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,093
Miss Sophie!

155
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,941
Robert...

156
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,278
Stop it!

157
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:53,053
When this job is over, will you
go to the church with me?

158
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,829
This is the last of the dangerous jobs.

159
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:57,964
When I come back,

160
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,299
I'll become an instructor at a
shooting range or something.

161
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,767
Be careful.

162
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,497
Don't let me become a widow
before the ceremony.

163
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,309
Robert...

164
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,302
How did it go?

165
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,827
Sir, all that's left is to order the dispatch.

166
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,605
Sorry for making you wait, Makimura.

167
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,766
Looks like I'll get to drink
with you again soon.

168
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,748
Don't do it!

169
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,052
That's right! Revenge is such
an outdated concept.

170
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,353
I can't not go.

171
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,151
It's my fault that Kaori was taken hostage.

172
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,525
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,358
But, Ryo, your wounds haven't healed yet.

174
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,963
No need to worry.

175
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,066
You're going no matter what, aren't you?

176
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,600
But be careful.

177
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,536
Guinness, the president of Guinness Corp,
arrived in Japan today.

178
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,298
Guinness did? I see. I'll be careful.

179
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,211
Get in.

180
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,179
I don't need your concern.

181
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,183
With your wounds, the upshot's going to be

182
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,014
that you'll get into an accident
before you get there.

183
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,989
Well, I'll do as I please.

184
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,226
Come back, all right?

185
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,529
I still owe you lots of mokkori.

186
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,326
Forget about it.

187
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,393
Otherwise, I won't be able to face Makimura.

188
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,435
Ryo, you don't intend to...

189
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,961
Take care of Kaori for me.

190
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,828
Make sure that she wants for nothing.

191
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,364
Got it.

192
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,653
Ryo...

193
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,421
Good, you came.

194
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,124
Looks like you still have a little pride left.

195
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,218
Sorry, but we'll have to postpone our match.

196
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,730
What?! Are you still going to...


197
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,131
Quit hiding like sewer rats and come on out!

198
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,173
I should have expected that of you, Saeba!

199
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,775
I was going to wait until
one of you went down,

200
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,911
but since you've noticed us,
I have no choice.

201
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,811
Guinness! How dare you?!

202
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,545
If we defeat the two of you, nothing could
better advertise the Guinness Corporation.

203
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,753
You could potentially lose all trust in you too.

204
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,348
We'll see how long your big talk will last.

205
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,038
I'll serve you plenty of treats:

206
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,335
Lead bullets.

207
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,920
Damn, what in the world?

208
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,454
Hey, don't leave me out. Serve me too.

209
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,495
Umibozu!

210
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,462
Umibozu!

211
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,600
Could that be Falcon?!

212
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,802
Why is he here?

213
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,771
Damn it! Shoot them all full of holes!
Kill them!

214
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,245
After them! Don't let them get away!

215
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,405
Yes, Sir!

216
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,684
You busybody, you should just
quietly play the café boss.

217
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,091
You stay here and rest, so you won't
drag down the rest of us!

218
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,867
Looks like we'll have a truce for a while.

219
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,235
I guess there's no choice.

220
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,567
You'd better not get killed by that rabble.

221
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,503
I'm the one who will kill you.

222
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,116
Are you okay, Ryo?! Your wounds must hurt.

223
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,452
Don't worry. You stay here and hide.

224
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,682
If anything should happen,
use this to defend yourself.

225
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,290
Got it?

226
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,663
Ryo!

227
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,895
Well, don't push yourself.

228
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,311
That's right, I shouldn't stop him.

229
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,782
Because this is Ryo's work.

230
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,072
What the?!

231
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,230
Damn Umibozu, he sure is
going wild over there.

232
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,202
Saeba!

233
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,647
It's all clear up there.

234
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,339
It's gotten quiet. I wonder if it's over?

235
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,806
Kaori!

236
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,243
Ryo!

237
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,051
Ryo, are you okay?!

238
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,723
You're slow.

239
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,918
It looks like the wounds Sophie gave you
are going to cost you your life.

240
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,888
We'll see about that. You never know
until it's all over.

241
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,990
This is the end, Mr. Saeba.

242
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,973
Impossible!

243
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,957
Looks like we swept them.

244
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,700
Now there's nothing to get
in the way of our duel.

245
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,129
As I promised, I'll fight you.

246
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,285
No!

247
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,286
Miss Kaori?!

248
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,520
If you're going to shoot, shoot me!

249
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,721
Get out of the way, Kaori!

250
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,747
No! There's no point in living if you die!

251
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,162
I've had enough of being
left behind to grieve!

252
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,823
My brother was bad enough!

253
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,669
Shoot!

254
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,432
Shoot us both together!

255
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,201
Get out of my way!

256
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,691
I knew from the beginning.

257
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,393
I knew that I couldn't shoot Saeba.

258
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,295
By continuing to hate you,
I felt like I was with him.

259
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,633
Miss Sophie...

260
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,638
Robert, I've lost you all over again.

261
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,823
I'm returning this to you.

262
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,430
I don't want any more sad
memories of Robert.

263
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,235
I think Robert would be happier if you had it.

264
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,443
All right, I'll hold onto it.

265
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,545
Miss Kaori, I'm sorry for all the trouble.

266
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,206
Not at all, take care.

267
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,729
Robert is dead, but from now on,

268
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,096
he'll continue to live on in my heart
through our happy memories.

269
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,227
It's all thanks to you.

270
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,797
Thank you.

271
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,377
Say, Falcon, did Saeba really intend to die?


272
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,073
He's a lucky bastard to have survived.

273
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:00,112
They both fought, intending to die. How sad.

274
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,891
Maybe in the end, we're all just
looking for a place to die.

275
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,951
I'll never forgive you if you die alone, Falcon!

276
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,423
When you die, I'll go with you.

277
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,235
What a public display of affection!

278
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,672
And they're getting into the
mood over there too.

279
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,142
Shall we go drinking, just us
unattached gals?

280
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,906
Of course! The one unattached
the longest gets to pay.

281
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,440
You go on home, okay?

282
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,974
Sister!

283
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,117
Flying through the sunrise

284
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,087
Searching for the sunset

285
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:57,299
Changing the color of my lipstick
doesn't excite me anymore

286
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:02,744
Because its color is far from that of dreams

287
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:11,020
A journey to see a sunrise
like a ball of fire

288
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:16,461
If I could invite you too

289
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:25,768
I would take to the sky like a feather

290
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:34,012
If I can become passionate,
that's all I want

291
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:42,351
An invisible sun will surely rise in my heart

292
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:50,318
I want to gaze upon something grand

293
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:56,835
Even my bit of courage goes barefoot

294
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:01,966
And runs away
