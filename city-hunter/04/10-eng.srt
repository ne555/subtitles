00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,526
Step on the gas

00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,896
Soaring too high

Running to the horizon

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,225
Break away from yesterday

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,261
Climbing on loneliness

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,996
Believe me baby

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,898
Running to the horizon

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,733
Break away from yesterday

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,703
Climbing on loneliness, seiza no kieta sora

24
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,507
Wow, wow, wow, joushiki no nai michi

25

Wow, wow, wow, yasashisa tada motome

Wow, wow, wow, yowasa to mukai au

Wow, wow, wow, sonna kimi wa iranai

28
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,679
Wow, the city's completely
in Christmas mode.

29
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,381
I just can't feel much enthusiasm
for a male client.

30
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,350
Don't be spoiled. It's the end of the year,
and we need the money.

31
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,822
Our client is the president of Yamaoka
Shipping, Shinzo Yamaoka, age fifty-seven.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,293
He became a widower ten years ago
and has not remarried since.

33
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,462
He's rumored to manage things in
a pretty dictatorial fashion.

34
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,829
He's a president! A president!
We might get a lot out of this.

35
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,935
If I'm going to get something out of this,
I'd rather get mokkori.

36
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,493
Jeez...

37
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,143
Shinzo Yamaoka

38
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:36,278
Looks like an old family that's
displaying its past glory.

39
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,562
We're from Saeba Firm.

40
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:47,124
Mr. Saeba and Miss Makimura?
We have been expecting you.

41
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:52,193
A Wedding Dress for Christmas
(Part 1)

42
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,211
He's sure taking his time.

43
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,838
Ryo is going to take a nap.

44
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,916
I haven't played billiards in a while.
Guess I'll kill some time.

45
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,888
Looks like I've lost my touch
since it's been so long.

46
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,773
What a mokkori!

47
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,210
Sir!

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,912
Miss, there is no need to grip
the cue so tightly.

49
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,587
Billiards is the same as capturing
the heart of a lover.

50
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,357
You aim for his heart and release the
arrow of love in one shot.

51
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,324
Okay...

52
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,662
It went in!

53
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,231
Excellent!

54
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,597
By the way, Miss, are you free tonight?

55
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,170
Kaori, I'll leave the rest up to you.

56
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,970
Saeba, I have a daughter who's about
to turn twenty-two, you see.

57
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,907
Well, Mr. President? Did you
just say something?

58
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,146
Her name is Tsubaki.

59
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,316
Actually, I want you to find her and
bring her back to me.

60
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:14,446
My, what a darling daughter! Why didn't
you say so to begin with?

61
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,389
Pardon me.

62
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,959
I could not help but be distracted by
the beautiful lady over here.

63
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,163
What?! But I'm not... How embarrassing.

64
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,290
But the word beautiful has
such a nice ring to it.

65
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,935
Sakurai, bring us a drink.

66
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,562
Yes, Sir.

67
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,846
It's a sherry from southern
Andartia in Spain.

68
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,481
What an expensive looking drink.

69
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,314
It doesn't bubble and it looks delicious.

70
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,954
The fragrance is wonderful.

71
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,421
Salute!

72
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,796
It's so delicious!

73
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,566
It's refreshing, and a mellow fragrance
spreads in my mouth.

74
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,436
It's a taste that reminds you of Spain,
the country of passion.

75
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,667
Hey, when did this turn into a gourmet show?

76
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,811
Watching the two of you reminds me
of when I was young.

77
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,113
I think we'll get along just fine.

78
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,615
Well, of course!

79
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,052
And I think I'll get along with your
daughter even better.

80
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,754
I'd like to know what this job is about.

81
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:25,892
Tsubaki is my only daughter and
she lost her mother early on.

82
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,996
So, I sent her to a strict Swiss
boarding school as a child.

83
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,833
I had her study management at a
university in Amsterdam, Holland.

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,701
And if I say so myself, her grades
were always top notch.

85
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,699
She's been good to me, and I've
loved her more than anything.

86
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,076
However!

87
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,415
Of all things, she was duped by the
idiot son of Umino Shipping,

88
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,217
and she eloped with him!

89
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,352
Umino Shipping?

90
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,556
If I recall correctly, Umino Shipping
is your competitor.

91
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,690
That's right.

92
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,493
My family and the Umino family have been
archrivals for a hundred years.

93
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,929
We've been battling fiercely for supremacy
in the shipping business

94
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,664
ever since the companies were founded.

95
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,467
There have even been several incidents
where blood was spilled.

96
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,204
I too have had my taste of grief and hardship
that I cannot share with outsiders.

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,900
I will never forget that hatred
for the rest of my life!

98
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,909
This is Kazuhiko Umino, who
duped my daughter!

99
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,914
Wow, quite the handsome young man.

100
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,245
He's no match for me.

101
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,285
I always thought that I could accept any
man as Tsubaki's husband

102
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,454
as long as it was what she wished.

103
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,789
I still believe it.

104
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,459
But I will never accept the idiot
son of the Umino family!

105
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,360
If that man takes my Tsubaki, I'll never
be able to rest in peace!

106
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:41,567
If you break them up and bring
Tsubaki back to me,

107
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,865
I would not mind giving you
her hand in marriage.

108
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,639
You think I'm good enough?!

109
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,007
I do not lie.

110
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:52,178
Wait, Mr. Yamaoka, do you have any idea
what kind of man he is?!

111
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,280
He's the world's biggest mokk...

112
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,578
Hey, now, you shouldn't slander
people, you know.

113
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,285
I know.

114
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:03,722
It was presumptuous, but I
investigated you thoroughly.

115
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,427
It seems that you are just like me
when I was young.

116
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,898
Every father wishes for his daughter
to marry a man like him.

117
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,800
Ryo's such a lucky boy!

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,292
Birds of a feather, aren't they?
Men are all the same.

119
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,807
I, Ryo Saeba, even if it should
cost me my life,

120
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,435
will take Miss Tsubaki back
from the idiot son.

121
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:24,944
I will be counting on you.

122
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,145
Leave it to me.

123
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,414
By the way, Miss Kaori, was it?

124
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,950
If you are free tonight, how about dinner?

125
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,185
No, thank you.


126
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,120
We will be declining this job as well.
Please excuse me.

127
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,960
What could she be mad about?

128
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,362
Oh, she's just being shy.

129
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,766
If I get Miss Tsubaki, Kaori
will become lonely.

130
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,000
I will be counting on you to take care of it.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,735
You don't need to tell me what to do.

132
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,473
Leaving a wonderful woman like that alone
would shame the name of any mokkori man.

133
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,963
Good luck to you too!

134
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,403
Truly a man just like Mr. Yamaoka
when he was young.

135
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,555
17,300 yen...

136
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,523
Completely in dire straits.

137
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,496
It's almost Christmas, but at this rate,

138
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,589
we won't even be celebrating
the New Year properly.

139
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,778
Three million?

140
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,913
Ryo!

141
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,048
Wedding garments sure are expensive.

142
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,650
You want to wear something like that?

143
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,052
Well...

144
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:40,686
Here!

145
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,754
What is it?

146
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:42,655
There's three million here.

147
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,123
You're going to buy it for me?!

148
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:44,924
Buy what?

149
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,361
You meant that it's the three million
for the dress, right?

150
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,029
It's an advance for the job.

151
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,732
Advance? You accepted that job?!

152
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,699
Yeah!

153
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,374
No way! No! No! Not ever!

154
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,311
When a man and a woman elope, it's
because they're really in love!

155
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,648
We can't accept a job that requires
us to split them up!

156
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,750
But we need money because it's
the end of the year, right?

157
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,787
This isn't about money! It's about
matters of the heart!

158
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,923
I never knew you were such
an insensitive guy!

159
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,257
I'm disappointed in you!

160
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,920
But the father even said that
Tsubaki was being duped.

161
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,398
And without the money, we can't
celebrate the New Year, right?

162
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,735
You just want to seduce Miss Tsubaki and
land in the lap of luxury! You're awful!

163
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,337
Kaori...

164
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,074
I draw a clear line between
business and pleasure.

165
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,809
I've always kept it that way.

166
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,546
Whatever! I don't know how many times
I've fallen for that!

167
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,013
How pitiful.

168
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:47,954
You think I'm the kind of man who would
forcibly split up a couple that eloped?

169
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,114
Pitiful.

170
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:53,593
A couple that doesn't have their parents'
approval must be unhappy.

171
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,959
It's a modern Romeo and Juliet.

172
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:02,298
I accepted this job with a mind to
do away with their unhappiness.

173
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:03,936
Ryo...

174
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,396
I don't want to see an ending
like Romeo and Juliet.

175
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,210
I had no idea.

176
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,715
I thought you understood that, but...

177
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,652
I'm sorry, I had no idea that was
what you had in mind.

178
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,779
I'll apologize, so go ahead and take this job.

179
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,824
You understand now?

180
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,860
Then, investigate for me why the
Yamaoka and Umino families

181
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,428
are so against each other.

182
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,496
You're right.

183
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,233
If we know why, we may be able to
talk both families out of it.

184
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,035
I'll find out where the two are staying.

185
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,502
All right.

186
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,104
Kaori, see you later!

187
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,343
Kabukicho Street 1

188
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,290
Wow! Balloon! Balloon!

189
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,891
Here!

190
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,426
Thank you.

191
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,586
Wasn't that great?

192
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,889
So that's the Kazuhiko Umino
who's duped Tsubaki.

193
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,937
You okay? Here, have a balloon.

194
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:12,835
Thank you!

195
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,408
My, what a kind Santa Claus.

196
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,073
I'm home!

197
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,369
Welcome home, Kazuhiko.

198
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,884
You must be tired.

199
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,319
Nope, not at all.

200
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,321
Oh, the owner of the shop is
a really nice guy too.

201
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,948
Really? I'm so glad to hear that.

202
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,720
That Kazuhiko doesn't seem like
such a bad guy to me.

203
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,436
Tsubaki Yamaoka and Kazuhiko Umino?

204
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,804
Who are you two?!

205
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,741
It's rude to enter someone's home
without permission!

206
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,044
I just came by to give you something
I was entrusted with.

207
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,841
Express tickets to Hell!

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,071
What's the meaning of this?! Who hired you?!

209
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,700
Who's there?! You won't get away
with interfering with us!

210
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,102
Look who's talking.

211
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,670
You're the ones who came into their
house with your shoes on.

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,898
Bastard!

213
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,976
Let's go!

214
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,409
Hurry up!

215
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,680
Next time I see you, you won't
get away so easily!

216
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,150
Well, thank you very much.

217
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,051
For what? There's no need to thank me.

218
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,043
I only did what would be expected
of me as your fiancé.

219
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,024
What's that supposed to mean?!

220
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,226
It means that Tsubaki's father officially
recognizes me as such.

221
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,028
Papa sent you!

222
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,296
Exactly.

223
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,562
Therefore, those guys were probably
dispatched by the Uminos.

224
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,371
Of course, I never thought they'd
go to such extremes.

225
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,672
Impossible!

226
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,375
No matter how much Mother
wanted us to split up,

227
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,343
she would never try to kill us!

228
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,513
Mother!

229
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,288
Kazuhiko, I searched everywhere for you.

230
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,357
You will be coming home tonight,
no matter what.

231
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,761
You'd better not have hired those guys
that just came after us!

232
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,129
What are you talking about?

233
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,892
Look at this mess!

234
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,303
Oh, how terrible.

235
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,439
This is not a suitable place for you to stay.

236
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,909
Now, let us go home where you belong.

237
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,036
No! I won't go home!

238
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,480
Kazuhiko!

239
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,548
And you are?

240
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:14,086
Ryo Saeba. Mr. Yamaoka has asked me
to bring back his daughter.

241
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,021
When you see Yamaoka, please tell him

242
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,458
that I have not forgotten his betrayal
of twenty-five years ago.

243
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,161
It seems that you know just as
little shame as he did.

244
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,129
What? What do you mean?!

245
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,233
I am referring to you having duped my son.

246
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,360
Like father, like daughter, I suppose.

247
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,539
That's not true! We love each other
with all our hearts!

248
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,974
What're you doing?! Let me go!

249
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:35,998
Kazuhiko!

250
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,415
Kazuhiko...

251
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,986
It'll be dangerous for you to stay here too.

252
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,079
Come with me for the time being.

253
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,794
There's no way that could be.

254
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,231
Kazuhiko's mother wouldn't
have hired those two.

255
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,102
They followed Kazuhiko Umino all the way.

256
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,538
If he was their only target, they
would have killed him then.

257
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,440
They must have wanted to find out where we
were staying and kill the both of us!

258
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,645
Any ideas who?

259
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,010
None.

260
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,082
By the way, his mother said

261
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,486
that she had not forgotten the betrayal
of twenty-five years ago.

262
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,454
Was there something between
your father and her?

263
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,690
I don't know. It's probably something
to do with business.

264
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,261
Just forget about it.

265
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,064
Forget that there ever was any love
between the two of you.

266
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,433
Just believe that you've been
having a bad dream.

267
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,937
That's not true! We seriously love each other!

268
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,064
Though I'm sure someone like you
could never understand!

269
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,074
No, I can't.

270
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,343
But I'd understand if you said you'd
save the one you love,

271
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,039
even if you had to storm the gates of Hell.

272
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,717
Right now, you seem as though you don't
care what happens anymore.

273
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,521
You're starting to suspect that
he really did dupe you.

274
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,490
That's not love. That's just a wild fancy.

275
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,262
So, forget about the heartless bastard
who abandoned you,

276
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,531
and go with the man your father
officially recognizes.

277
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,899
Get mokkori with me!

278
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,633
No!

279
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,368
It's dangerous!

280
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,835
I'll never marry you!

281
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,079
Wait! What're you going to do?!

282
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,015
I'll prove to you that the love we have is real!

283
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:30,984
I'm sorry! Kazuhiko's the only man for me!

284
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:40,099
I see, looks like she's serious, but...

285
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,899
Why does poor Ryo have to play this part?!

286
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,275
What?! She got away?!

287
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,811
I thought she was a sheltered rich girl,

288
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,938
but she turned out to be one mean shrew.

289
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,516
You didn't do something to her, did you?

290
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,212
Wait! I didn't do anything!
Before I got around to it...

291
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,622
I knew it!

292
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,524
I was an idiot for having trusted you!

293
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,961
You accepted the job to bring
them happiness, my ass!

294
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,230
Romeo and Juliet, my ass!

295
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,499
Yeah, my intentions were good.

296
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,335
Liar! If you seriously meant to talk to the
parents and make the couple happy,

297
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,739
there'd be no reason for her to run away!

298
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,343
If you'd tried harder, you could've taken
her home to talk to her father!

299
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,844
I'm very sorry.

300
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,047
And what about the advance we got?

301
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,182
What? You used it up already?!

302
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,550
Things such as paying off debts and

303
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,314
getting ready for Christmas and
New Year's used up half of it.

304
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,224
That's why we absolutely have to get her
back home at least once!

305
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,295
Really? And who was it that said
this wasn't about money?

306
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,130
That's not it!

307
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,466
We don't know why the two families
are fighting,

308
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,669
so I thought we'd take her home
and find out the reason!

309
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,171
I see.

310
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,005
In either case, we need to find her then.

311
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,378
I understand, Kaori. I'll give it another try.

312
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,415
Try? But what are you going to do without
even knowing where she is?

313
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,986
Well, Tsubaki said she'd prove
that their love is true.

314
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,157
In other words, she'll go to save him
from his mother's place alone.

315
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,425
I see.

316
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,695
If we keep an eye on the Umino mansion,
Miss Tsubaki should appear.

317
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,466
Exactly, we'll just go watch for her handiwork.

318
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,034
I'll go keep a lookout starting tomorrow.

319
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,468
Not you, I'll do it.

320
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,237
I get the feeling that I'm not very trusted.

321
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,172
Got it, Ryo? You're forbidden to go out
all day today, okay?

322
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:46,291
Hey, Kaori! What's all this about?!
Take these off!

323
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,918
What's the meaning of this?!

324
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,794
Hey, Kaori! What if I have to
go to the bathroom?!

325
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,904
Umino Yuki
Kazuhiko

326
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,485
Looks like Miss Tsubaki hasn't appeared yet.

327
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:28,367
Ladies and gentlemen, I know you
are all busy people.

328
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,969
Thank you for attending my
birthday party, welcome.

329
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,302
I have reached my fifty-fifth birthday
somewhere along my work-filled days.

330
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,012
Since I lost my husband and
took over Umino Shipping,

331
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,681
despite being a woman, eighteen years
have quickly passed.

332
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,206
I am thinking that it is about time
for me to retire.

333
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:52,558
But thankfully, I have my humble son,
Kazuhiko, as an heir.

334
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,892
Today, Kazuhiko has decided to take over
the company after me.

335
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,593
Kazuhiko lacks in experience,
and he is still a bachelor.

336
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:08,563
If there are any suitable young ladies
out there, please come forward.

337
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,376
Kazuhiko!

338
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,537
Did you hear?! Aren't you glad we came?!

339
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:21,053
Today, we celebrate my birthday and
the announcement of my heir.

340
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,817
Ladies and gentlemen, please
enjoy yourselves.

341
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,698
If what Ryo said is true, I wonder
how Miss Tsubaki

342
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,724
is going to escape with him from such
a heavily guarded place?

343
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,579
What?! What's going on?!

344
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:54,447
A horse?! No way! What's a
horse doing here?!

345
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,789
Tsubaki!

346
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,246
Kazuhiko!

347
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,164
What are you doing?! Go get Kazuhiko!

348
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,256
Yes, Ma'am!

349
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,034
Tsubaki!

350
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,524
Kazuhiko!

351
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,125
How daring.

352
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,251
Amazing!

353
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,795
But how refreshing.

354
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,128
It's quite something to go to such lengths.

355
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,695
That's right! They got away! That means...

356
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,935
What'll I do about the money I spent?

357
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:54,372
Miss Tsubaki, if you wish to take
Kazuhiko that badly...

358
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,131
We have both targets.

359
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,966
We'll follow them now.

360
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,797
Requesting backup, just in case.

361
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,283
Flying through the sunrise

362
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,221
Searching for the sunset

363
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:57,299
Mou kuchibeni kaete mo tokimekanai no yo

364
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:02,744
Yume no iro ni wa toui kara

365
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:11,020
Hi no tama no you na asahi o mini iku tabi e

366
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:16,461
Moshi anata mo sasoetara

367
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:25,768
Hane no you ni maiagaruwa sora e

368
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:34,012
Atsuku naretara sore de ii

369
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:42,351
Kono mune ni kitto mienai hi ga noboru

370
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:50,318
Ookina mono o mitsumetai

371
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:56,835
Chiiisana tsuyogari mo hadashi no mama

372
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:01,966
Nigete yuku yo

373
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,381
I've got to take my hat off to
Tsubaki for her courage.

374
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,049
But our worries aren't over yet.

375
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,452
There are still those guys who've been
following them all along.

376
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,021
I hope we can learn why the two families
are feuding soon

377
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,756
so we can let them be happy
and tie the knot.

378
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,492
While we're at it, you want to wear
a wedding gown too?

379
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,159
Really?!

380
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,360
Just kidding.

381
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,763
You're going to use me as bait
again, aren't you?!

382
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,031
City Hunter 3:

383
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,400
"A Wedding Dress for Christmas (Part 2)"

384
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,698
You won't be able to tie the knot
if you don't watch.
