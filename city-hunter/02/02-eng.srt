12
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,065
One day, I met this girl,
Akemi Tezuka, in the city.

13
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,969
She's only fifteen but already
a model and poster girl.

14
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,306
Later on, she asks me to be her bodyguard.

15
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,842
Oh, my Lolita woes!

16
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,545
Watch it now! Don't be making any
moves on a fifteen year old girl!

17
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,982
As it turns out, Akemi's made up
this marriage stuff with me

18
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,440
so she could quit modelling and pursue
her dream of being a photographer.

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,891
But this Kaijin X character who targets her
is actually her loving brother, Atsushi, right?

20
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,626
Well, case solved then.

21
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,494
You would think that, but it turns out
someone really is after her.

22
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,196
I wonder what will happen?

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,560
Ryo's Her Future Husband?!
Her Horoscope Says She'll
Meet and Marry Him!
(Part 2)

24
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:34,110
Oh, man, I bet Saeba told my sister
about me being Kaijin X.

25
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,651
She must be furious. What am I going to do?

26
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,458
How could you do such a thing?!
I want you to go back home.

27
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,121
Saeba can take care of me forever.

28
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:51,496
No! Sis!

29
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,366
She wouldn't do that.

30
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,035
Atsushi!

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,877
Akemi, I didn't...

32
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,616
What's wrong with you? Get up now.

33
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,914
Just cause it's spring break doesn't
mean you can sleep all day!

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,655
Breakfast...

35
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,532
Mister!

36
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,496
Not Mister, my name is Saeba!

37
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,032
Why didn't you tell my sister about me?

38
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:32,540
The truth about Kaijin X doesn't change
the fact that Akemi is a target.

39
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,646
Even you have something called
your honor to think about.

40
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,413
Oh, yeah, Mr. Saeba, I finally
have a day off today.

41
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,825
I wonder if you'd come with me?

42
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,158
Does that mean you're asking me
out on a date?! Wow!

43
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,863
I'm coming too!

44
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,353
You can't today.

45
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,966
You'll be in the way. Stay home.

46
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,001
How come?! Why?!

47
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,700
The position of the planets is
bad for you today.

48
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,545
You could meet with accidents
or disasters, they say.

49
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,103
Don't go outside now.

50
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,381
Bye!

51
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,785
Fine by me! I'll just follow you.

52
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,049
You think I'm going to let you
be alone with that guy?

53
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,450
And don't be trying to follow us either.

54
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,862
If you do, I'll tell your sister
about Kaijin X's identity.

55
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,963
Okay, take care of the house, Atsushi.

56
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,452
All right then, where shall we go for our date?

57
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,120
Let's see, how about the two of us alone
in a dark and secret room?

58
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,852
Secret room?!

59
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,902
Photo Studio

60
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,802
Dark Room
Film development in progress. Do not enter.

61
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,841
Well, this certainly is a dark room,

62
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,002
but coming to the studio on your day off?

63
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,212
I asked them to let me use it on my off days.

64
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,711
My own equipment is a mess because of
what happened the other day.

65
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,421
I'm so busy and I have all of
this undeveloped film.

66
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,955
Please give me a hand.

67
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,980
I get it. So that's what you wanted.

68
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,857
What?! Can't see a thing!

69
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,862
Oh?!

70
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,124
What's this?

71
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,600
That mokkori sensation!

72
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,502
Go over there! I need to open the film.

73
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,070
What is this? What a bad photo!

74
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,051
I was taking a shot with the timer
and the tripod fell over.

75
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,053
I guess this is that photo.

76
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,146
Even you make those kinds of mistakes?

77
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,792
That man...

78
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,483
What is it? Someone you know?

79
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,359
When did you take this?
Do you remember the date?

80
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,260
As I recall, it was last...

81
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,404
...last...

82
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,509
It's here all right, Ryo.

83
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,180
Last Saturday, a murder in
the business district.

84
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,424
The time was around three o' clock.

85
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,062
The place was the City Dai-ichi
Building in Yoyogi.

86
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,654
Why the interest?

87
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,499
That's what I was afraid of.

88
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,892
Saeba, what is it?

89
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,070
It's bad! Let's get back to your place!

90
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:56,471
Damn it! That Lolita weirdo!
I'll tell him off sometime!

91
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:06,754
What is it?! I'm the only one here.
A burglar?! Or could it be...

92
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,762
It's Akemi's room.

93
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,431
Could be a cat.

94
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,873
Maybe Saeba snuck back and
is looking for something.

95
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,507
All right.

96
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,258
Hey! Who are you?!

97
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,539
Who are you?!

98
00:07:55,608 --> 00:08:00,102
Bad luck you saw me, boy.
You didn't go with them?

99
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,156
That man in the photo is a professional killer

100
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,750
that the underworld calls the Silver Fox.

101
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,750
So he's afraid someone might take
this photo to the police.

102
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,432
Something like that.
Whatever they did though,

103
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,832
he'd probably attempt to kill the
person who took his photo.

104
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,729
I expect he thinks the film is still at
your place, and if he does...

105
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,740
You mean?!

106
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,377
Right, if he does, Atsushi is in danger!

107
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,146
Just chalk it up to bad luck
and give yourself up.

108
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,891
Considering how you saw my face,
I can't let you live.

109
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,702
Someone! Help!

110
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,605
That's it, little boy.

111
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,909
This time... this time, it's over.

112
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,790
Saeba!

113
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,763
It's been a while, Silver Fox.
Don't move now.

114
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,340
Damn it!

115
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,106
Wow! A bra-chan!

116
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,852
Where's the Fox? Where'd he go?

117
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,507
Damn! Quick on his feet as usual.

118
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,238
Just a second, if Kaori were here
at this very moment...

119
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,783
It's all because you're a sexual maniac!

120
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,212
I know!

121
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,385
Wait, no!

122
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,594
It's a war trophy more precious than
my own life. I'm not letting go!

123
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,100
Atsushi...

124
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,034
I'm okay, I tell you.

125
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,670
You seem unhurt. You did well, Atsushi.
I have a new respect for you.

126
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,677
Saeba...

127
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,139
Thank you, Saeba!

128
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,586
Your bouncibles are against my chest!
I can't breathe!

129
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:02,858
Butting in like that! I could have
whipped him by myself!

130
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,421
Atsushi, that's no way to treat the
man who saved your life!

131
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,506
Akemi, are you really going to
work at a time like this?

132
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,215
Well, what happened to that brave
knight who until just yesterday

133
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,116
was insisting he'd protect me.
Just look at you!

134
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,657
Anyway, why don't we get our knight there

135
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,592
to at least hold onto that package
so it doesn't fall.

136
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,351
Package? Oh, this. What is it?

137
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,199
Just a little present that the
Silver Fox sent us.

138
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,834
It was rigged to the car.

139
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,636
Rigged?!

140
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,505
Don't drop it. The slightest shock and...

141
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,773
It's a bomb?!

142
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,570
BOOM!

143
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,912
Just kidding, take it easy.
It's already been disarmed.

144
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,151
What's your date of birth, Saeba?
Could you tell me?

145
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,715
Why do you want to know?

146
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,884
I wanted to check the horoscope to
see if you can protect me.

147
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:15,601
Don't trust me? Well, if it'll make
you feel better, let's see,

148
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:21,233
March of 1967, on the 31st I believe.

149
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:27,145
March 31, you're an Aries.

150
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:34,920
Waiting room

151
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,821
Waiting room
Akemi, how can you just sit there like that?!
Aren't you afraid?!

152
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,279
Akemi, how can you just sit there like that?!
Aren't you afraid?!

153
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,894
It's amazing.

154
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:47,264
Just the thought that Mr. Saeba is nearby is
somehow enough to make me feel very safe.

155
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,796
She sure is placing her trust in Saeba.

156
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,479
Man, Atsushi, look at this!

157
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,506
It's a studio all right, nude photos
are all over the place!

158
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,677
Boy! I've never seen such a
sexual maniac before!

159
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:14,349
But when it comes to being a man,
he's really got me beat.

160
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,265
Hey, hey! Come on, what's wrong
with you today?

161
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,801
Why not look at these nude photos
to cheer you up?

162
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,068
Who cares about those?!

163
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,670
Come on, take a look, I tell you!

164
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,160
No, I said!

165
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,537
Still, that photographer sure is late.

166
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,347
You can just stay here and
take a nap for a while.

167
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:47,354
Akemi! Sorry to be late!
Let's go ahead and do a camera test.

168
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,050
Okay!

169
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,096
He came all right.

170
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,399
He came?! Him, you mean?!

171
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,026
Where?! Where?!

172
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,892
Take it easy. Calm down, Atsushi.

173
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,576
Where are your assistants?

174
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,170
This is just a test, so I didn't
ask them to come.

175
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,919
This is no ordinary camera.

176
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,689
I hit the shutter and a bullet
is fired through the lens.

177
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,657
It's a camera-shaped gun.

178
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,626
You won't even have time to scream.

179
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,296
Sir!

180
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,059
Yes?! What could it be?!

181
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,797
You aren't going to use any lighting?!

182
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,526
Yes, you're right.

183
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,906
My assistants always do that, so I forgot
completely. Okay, we're ready.

184
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,807
She surprised me. If I don't hurry,
my disguise will start peeling off.

185
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,476
I pity her, but...

186
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,456
What do you think you're doing?!

187
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,724
Mr. Saeba?!

188
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,319
I just wanted to join in is all.

189
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,425
That camera?!

190
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,664
You didn't happen to notice your
camera had been switched?

191
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,030
Silver Fox!

192
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,072
Silver Fox?!

193
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,002
Akemi, get over there!

194
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,271
I don't know what you mean.

195
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:18,115
You planted those nude photos to
keep me occupied, didn't you?

196
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,154
Well done, Ryo Saeba!

197
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,419
Sorry, but you can't trick me, Silver Fox!

198
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,125
Okay, don't make any trouble.
I'm the one with the gun.

199
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,255
Now look who's tricking who.

200
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,201
That stuff about switching cameras,
that's a lie.

201
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,096
Oh, really? Want to find out then?

202
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:51,111
If you're going to quit, you'd better
do it now! I know your tricks!

203
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:56,053
You go down with this gun and City Hunter
will be the laughingstock!

204
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,419
Listen to you chatter on.

205
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,824
Oh, well, this'll be your last
commemorative photo.

206
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,056
Just shut up and give me a big smile!

207
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,843
Okay, okay, don't shoot! I lose!

208
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,835
All right, I'll let you slide this time. See?

209
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,410
I have the negatives to that film
you want right here.

210
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,687
I'll hold on to them. So don't you
ever bother that girl again.

211
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,189
If you ever do...

212
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,953
Okay! Okay! Stay away from me!

213
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,296
Just kidding!

214
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,820
Darn it!

215
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,026
What?!

216
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,594
Married?!

217
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,475
Yes, the ceremony will be on my birthday.

218
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,705
I'd be delighted if you'd attend.

219
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,379
Ceremony?

220
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,846
Ryo! What have you...

221
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,913
You're serious!

222
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,887
It's all over!

223
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,055
Sir?!

224
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,392
We just put Kaijin X behind us,
and now look what happens!

225
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,793
We can't market a married pop idol!

226
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,654
We did it!

227
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,001
Thanks for your help!

228
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,371
I'm so happy! Now you are free to
do what you want to do!

229
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,239
I get it. That's what it was about.
You're so kindhearted, Ryo.

230
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,170
Kaori?!

231
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,911
Surprising me like that, you!

232
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,883
What did you think?! No way we
would really get married.

233
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,384
Don't be so angry.

234
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,154
Idiot! That's not what I'm angry about!

235
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,824
As compensation for you ruining her
debut in entertainment,

236
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,122
we won't be receiving payment!

237
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,463
Thanks to you, yet another freebie!

238
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,800
Mr. Saeba! It's my fault. I'm sorry.

239
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,394
No, it's okay. We're used to it.

240
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,199
You don't want me?

241
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,402
Won't you take me in lieu of your fee?

242
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,214
Take you? But you're not just
some cat or something.

243
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:09,484
What are you saying? I'm not your type.
This was just an act, wasn't it?

244
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,185
I wasn't acting at all.

245
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:19,398
I checked my horoscope using your date
of birth. We're the perfect match.

246
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,832
It says we'd be the perfect couple
if we get married.

247
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,035
My date of birth?

248
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,371
Come on, you just told me this morning.

249
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,933
You said you were an Aries
born on March 31, 1967!

250
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,606
How... how could you?!
That's my birthday!

251
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,986
What? No, how awful!

252
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,758
What can I say?

253
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,784
I'm sorry. I thought it would make you
feel better and it came right out.

254
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,495
I see, you and Kaori are the perfect match.

255
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,561
Akemi!

256
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,336
Are you ever going to stop laughing?!

257
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:10,211
Why do you have to get mad
no matter what I do?

258
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,679
Don't you know anything about
a young girl's feelings?!

259
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,922
She has been deeply hurt! Think about it!

260
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,682
Well, yeah, I...

261
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,433
In other words, he dumped you, right?

262
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:39,874
But that's for the best. With that guy,
he sees your underwear, mokkori.

263
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:44,481
Sees your poster, mokkori.
Mokkori this, mokkori that.

264
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,982
There's no other maniac like him.
He's the lowest of the low!

265
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,623
That's enough!

266
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,059
Saeba's not like that!
And never say that again!

267
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:02,060
I'll say it as much as I want.
He's the lowest of the lowest of the low!

268
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,025
Atsushi!

269
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,266
What do you want?! You want to tangle?!

270
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,263
You were Kaijin X, I'm told.

271
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,515
You played pranks on everyone
and got Saeba hurt.

272
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:21,286
I was going to give you a good scolding,
but Saeba said,

273
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,278
"Atsushi did those things because
he loves you so.

274
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,590
Please take his feelings into consideration."

275
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,992
He is the lowest! He broke his promise
as a man and told on me!

276
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,067
You still don't understand his
tenderness as a man?!

277
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,557
He is a wonderful person.

278
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,238
Those are the very qualities that
made me love him!

279
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:47,972
The truth is finally out. Then what are
you doing hiding here then?!

280
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,282
His date of birth, so what?

281
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,917
Your horoscope or being a
good match, so what?

282
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,010
Those things don't matter
if you love him, right?!

283
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,790
Hey! Open this door, Atsushi!

284
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,621
Shut up! Falling in love with that loser
makes you a loser too! Get out!

285
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:09,993
You can just go to that loser's place.
Say hi to the loser for me now!

286
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,531
Atsushi, you little devil.

287
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,568
Stubborn kid.

288
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,014
Boy-o-boy, some troublesome sister there.

289
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,619
Still, if they...

290
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,022
That makes him...

291
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,389
my loser brother.

292
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:41,400
I know you're asking to stay and all,
but like you said,

293
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,129
Kaori's the one who's compatible, so...

294
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,138
No, I've realized something.

295
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,473
You can't live your life according
to a horoscope.

296
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,010
What's important is trying to
make your life and destiny

297
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,773
go in the direction you choose.

298
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,843
I'm impressed, I'm impressed.

299
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,578
Or so it said in my book on astrology!

300
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,551
Let's make a happy home together, Darling!

301
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,588
Hey, Kaori! Don't leave me! Do something!

302
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:19,200
Maybe I should use astrology to
find a good man myself.

303
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,516
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

304
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,989

Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no

Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa

311
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,693
Don't you, don't you know

312
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:21,066
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

313

Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,

Hontou no dance, chance,

315
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,920
There's someone targeting Kaori?
What kind of doofus is he?

316
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,121
It has to be Silver Fox.

317
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,757
He probably wants to get back at Ryo
through me for his defeat.

318
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,660
What?! Because Kaori's my lover?!
This is bad.

319
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,895
He's not getting away with this.

320
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,830
Ryo, you'll protect me, won't you?

321
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,633
I have to clear up that misunderstanding
no matter what!

322
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,364
You irresponsible jerk! Bastard!
I hope you die!

323
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,005
City Hunter 2:

324
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,841
"Kaori's in Danger!
Love Means Saying Goodbye (Part 1)"

325
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,240
You'll get the hammer if you don't watch it.

326
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:08,244
Please look forward to the next episode
