Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,

00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Mayonaka no lady, hitogomi ni magire

00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
Utsurigi na steppin' kurikaeshite iru

Odori akashite mo

Oh, Sarah, akirame nai de,

Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,830
This time, the client is an
eleven-year-old girl, Sara.

14
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,467
Her father passed away and her
relatives are trying to kill her

15
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,902
because they're fighting over
the family property.

16
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,905
Anyway, her attendant, Akiko,
the nanny, is gorgeous!

17
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,375
Hey, hey, Ms. Sara can read
other people's minds.

18
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,212
Be careful, try not to let her
read your lewd mind.

19
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,315
However, I guess she fell in love with me.

20
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,550
I guess I'm attractive to children.

21
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,688
Oh, no, Sara read my mind and
she found out I love Ryo!

22
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,889
What should I do?

23
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:07,849
Mokkori Everywhere!
Ryo's Mind and an Esper Girl
(Part 2)

24
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,697
Well, Ms. Sara, let's start today's
study, Japanese.

25
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,663
I wonder how Mr. Saeba feels
about Ms. Kaori?

26
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:28,181
Ms. Sara, I told you not to peek
into Mr. Saeba's mind.

27
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,808
What? What's going on there?

28
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,013
Oh, Sara, studying?

29
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,588
You are a good girl.

30
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,078
Here, have some juice.

31
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,492
Ms. Sara!

32
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,664
What's wrong with her? Something's wrong.

33
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,155
I feel like she hates me.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,828
She read your mind, didn't she?

35
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,031
Sara can easily find out whether you're
a cold-hearted person or not.

36
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,009
Oh, no.

37
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,172
Am I really cold-hearted?

38
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,450
Now, the next incredible man is the
scary man from Yokohama, Mr. Genda.

39
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,351
Here comes Mr. Genda...

40
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,377
Ms. Sara, do you want to play
a TV game with me?

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,692
Here you go, Ms. Sara.
How about some cake?

42
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,365
Hey, this comic is funny.

43
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:25,071
She seriously hates me!

44
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,801
I'm going to be so depressed.

45
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,611
Wow, gorgeous! Looks good!

46
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,783
Sara, I heard you like it.

47
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,274
Ms. Akiko taught me and I made it.

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,626
Ms. Sara, cut it out! Ms. Kaori made
a great effort to make it!

49
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,594
It's okay, Ms. Akiko.

50
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,296
Ms. Sara!

51
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,763
Wait!

52
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,196
Ms. Sara, get out of there!

53
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:06,267
I wonder if I'm such a cold-hearted woman?

54
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,317
Sara really hates me. What shall I do?

55
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,121
Ms. Kaori...

56
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,657
I think there's a reason. Don't be depressed.

57
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,995
Mr. Saeba...

58
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,300
Why are you looking at her so generously?

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,291
Mr. Saeba, do you also love Ms. Kaori?

60
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,673
Are you all right, Kaori?!

61
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,110
Ms. Kaori...

62
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,746
Sara!

63
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,949
Ms. Akiko, follow Sara.

64
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,219
If she runs out into town at night,
they'll be waiting for her.

65
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,686
Yes!

66
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,656
Ryo, you too. Go!

67
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,217
This wound is nothing. Sara is
more critical. Hurry!

68
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,961
Kaori!

69
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,428
I understand.

70
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,768
I have to go too.

71
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,238
That was the door at the top.

72
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,686
What shall I do? I hurt Ms. Kaori.

73
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,120
I don't know what to do.

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,781
You are here, just as I thought.

75
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,825
I'm so relieved.

76
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,628
I was worried about you because I thought
you might have gone outside.

77
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,563
Well, it's cold here. Let's go back inside.

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,336
Oh, I see. You hate me, don't you?

79
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,167
I guess you won't come with me.

80
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,874
Here, your friend.

81
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,865
When you feel better, please
come back downstairs.

82
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,812
No, that's not it, Ms. Kaori.

83
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,981
I understand you without
having to touch you.

84
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,246
I can feel your kindness all around me.

85
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,849
I did a bad thing to you, but
you're worrying about me.

86
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,528
Sara...

87
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,463
I'm sorry. You're a warm person, Ms. Kaori.

88
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,134
I'm the one with a problem.

89
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,802
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,269
Sorry!

91
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,074
It's okay. You don't need to
apologize to me.

92
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,338
It wasn't a big deal.

93
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,268
I didn't intend to cause you trouble.

94
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,579
I was just jealous.

95
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,980
Ms. Kaori, you love Mr. Saeba, don't you?


96
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,023
What? What are you talking about?

97
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,958
How could I love a pervert like him?

98
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,292
It's useless to tell you something like that.

99
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:46,105
Ms. Kaori, you've been living with
Mr. Saeba for a long time,

100
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,076
and I was wondering if Mr. Saeba
also loves you.

101
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,703
So I was frustrated.

102
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,078
I see. You love Ryo too.

103
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,256
But his mind is just like the clouds

104
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,260
and there's no way for me to
find out what he's thinking.

105
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,990
He doesn't even react to my feelings.

106
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,699
Therefore, it's not reasonable
to be jealous of me.

107
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,261
We can't figure out what he's thinking
and we're the same.

108
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,375
Shake hands. We'll be good rivals.

109
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:29,007
But I won't lose to you ten years from now.

110
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,651
Ten years from now, I will be taking
advantage of you.

111
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,020
You smart mouth.

112
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,695
I wonder what they're talking about?

113
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,230
I don't know,

114
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,998
but what I said was right.

115
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,297
It's easier to solve the problem
if they talk directly.

116
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,803
Nishikujo

117
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,613
Idiots!

118
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,916
It's been five days since Sara disappeared.


119
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,941
How long are you going to be fooling around?!

120
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,423
Mr. Sadamitsu, that nanny has hired
a ridiculous bodyguard, Sir.

121
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,890
A ridiculous bodyguard?

122
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes, Sir. He's called City Hunter,

123
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,825
one of the top sweepers in
the underground world.

124
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:22,264
Then we'll hire someone who can rival him.


125
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:27,201
Yes, Sir. I have someone in mind.

126
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,343
Good, contact him as soon as possible.

127
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,411
I don't care how much he costs.

128
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,400
Yes, Sir.

129
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:42,515
After that weird Sara disappears, the
Nishikujo Concern will be all mine.

130
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,698
Mr. Shigenobu...

131
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,496
You were in love with Sara's father,
weren't you?

132
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,508
The way you serve Sara looks like
more than being just a nanny.

133
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,010
That's why, isn't it?

134
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,001
Oh, well, I...

135
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,415
But I think it must be painful for him as well

136
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,752
to be seen in that photo, so
emaciated from the poison.

137
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,912
What?

138
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,223
I know that you suspect

139
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,683
Sara's father might have been murdered,
rather than dying from an illness.

140
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,772
Then, who do you want me to kill?

141
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,208
The man called City Hunter.
Do you know him?

142
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,111
Yes, I've heard his name.

143
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,646
Can you?

144
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,012
Who do you think you're talking to?

145
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,985
Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,249
There are two more we want you to kill.

147
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,121
Here, their pictures.

148
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,793
Both of them are also at
City Hunter's apartment.

149
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,428
I don't want you to ask why,

150
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,760
but we will pay you as much as you want.

151
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,599
Okay.

152
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,801
Oh, you're accepting?

153
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,770
You're so lucky to have asked me to do this.

154
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:15,913
I owe him something, so you're really lucky.

155
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,920
Well, I guess we're lucky.

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,117
Indeed, we were able to ask
a strong man like you.

157
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,500
People called him
one of the Elite

158
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,567
This snapshot from a magazine
was taken six months ago.

159
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,838
Compared to this healthy looking
picture you can tell.

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,211
In less than six months,
he lost so much weight.

161
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,249
This is not because of an illness.

162
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,351
The way his cheeks became hollow
and his color,

163
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,081
these are the symptoms of being poisoned.

164
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,081
But the diagnosis of his doctor
was an illness.

165
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,390
What if the doctor was one of the criminals?

166
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,565
It's easy for a doctor to make it look
like he died from an illness,

167
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,829
by mixing poison into the medicine.

168
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,571
And now, the person trying to kill Sara
is probably the same person.

169
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,009
I've been thinking it was strange that
he died from an illness.

170
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,145
But there was no evidence.

171
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,850
But just as I thought, I was right.

172
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,976
It's horrible.

173
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,112
Somebody's coming!

174
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,776
Hi.

175
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,278
Umibozu!

176
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,612
What's going on?

177
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,512
I brought some lucky fellows.

178
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,517
Out of luck! Completely out of luck!

179
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,317
Nobody told me that Umibozu and
City Hunter were together!

180
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,395
I see. Those guys hired you
to kill me, didn't they?

181
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,885
Exactly, right?

182
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,292
The person who hired them
was Sadamitsu Nishikujo.

183
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,168
Mr. Sadamitsu did?

184
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,204
Who's that?

185
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,098
Mr. Shigenobu's older brother.

186
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,310
When Mr. Shigenobu was alive,

187
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,505
he had to accept being second in command.

188
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:31,211
Oh jeez, a dull older brother killed
his bright younger brother.

189
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,648
Now, he's trying to get his niece.

190
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,050
Ryo, what are you going to do now?

191
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,124
Let's see.

192
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,651
Since we found out who the criminal is,
we have nothing to do here.

193
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,392
Why don't we go to the castle and
get it back for the princess?

194
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,802
Are you scared, Sara?

195
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:08,277
You won't be able to win against the evil
minds if you continue to be scared.

196
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,490
I know that you've heard our conversation.

197
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,827
The person who killed your father
was your uncle.

198
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,796
Mr. Saeba, what on earth?!

199
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,966
You have to fight against the evil minds

200
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,867
if you don't want to lose what's
important to you.

201
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,275
Mr. Saeba, what are you going
to have Ms. Sara do?

202
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,505
Oh my, what a big mansion!

203
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,413
Since we passed the gate, how long
have I been driving?

204
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,608
I hope we'll be able to get there
sometime today.

205
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,652
What? Sara is back now?!

206
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,019
Yes, Sir. She's fine so please be relieved.

207
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,295
What's going on?

208
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,389
I thought Sara left because she found out
this place was dangerous for her.

209
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,534
Then why did she come back now?

210
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,731
I wonder if they came back quickly because
of the news of the kidnapping?

211
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,572
Excuse me, Sir, is anything wrong?

212
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,878
No, I'm overwhelmingly happy.

213
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,505
Well, where is Sara now?

214
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,750
Yes, Sir. She is at the heated
swimming pool down there.

215
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,151
What? At the heated swimming pool?

216
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,025
Is she there?

217
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,492
Yes, Sir!

218
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,861
Lucky me.

219
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,167
Listen, don't let anybody get close to
that place from now on. Nobody.

220
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,136
Yes, Sir.

221
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,135
Yahoo!

222
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,648
Indeed, this family is rich! What a huge pool!

223
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,352
I've been longing for a pool like this
from which I can see the sea.

224
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,588
In the summer, it would be nice to
have a party on a private beach!

225
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,783
What are you thinking, both of you?

226
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,928
We didn't come back here to play around
in the pool! How ridiculous!

227
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,064
Oh, don't be strict like that.
Why don't you join us and swim?

228
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,499
No, thank you.

229
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,102
I didn't bring my bathing suit like you.

230
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,403
Well, here you go!

231
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,870
What?

232
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,640
Perfect size for you.

233
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,716
The person we're waiting for is here, I guess.

234
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:18,683
I guess.

235
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,687
Hi, Sara. I'm glad you are all right.

236
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,314
I've been worried about you.

237
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,907
Akiko, I can't believe you are back
like this without any hesitation.

238
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,243
We trusted you a great deal,

239
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,545
but you kidnapped my lovely niece!

240
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,172
I'm going to take you to the police!

241
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,884
How dare you say such a thing about me?!

242
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,452
Well, come here, Sara.

243
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,216
You've been cheated by that evil woman.

244
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,492
What's the matter, Sara?

245
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,127
It's useless.

246
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:06,928
You can't hide your dirty mind
from Sara's eyes.

247
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,598
Who's that? Where are you? Come out!

248
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,163
Sadamitsu!

249
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:21,339
I'm impressed by your ability
to get scared like that.

250
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,742
You thought I was Sara's father's
ghost, didn't you?

251
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,787
What are you talking about?

252
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,322
I don't understand you at all.

253
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,224
More importantly, you bastard,

254
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,060
you're like Akiko, a kidnapper, aren't you?


255
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,551
I've already contacted the police.
Be prepared!

256
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,599
Who's really in trouble?

257
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,502
Well, Sara will answer that question.

258
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,298
What?

259
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,962
Sara, take my hand.

260
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,167
Mr. Saeba!

261
00:16:55,814 --> 00:17:00,376
Sara, now you're going to touch
your uncle's hand.

262
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,389
No way!

263
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,324
Don't hurt Ms. Sara any more!

264
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,558
Ms. Akiko!

265
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,461
Let me go, Ms. Kaori! I have to
stop this cruel thing!

266
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,828
No, this is what Ms. Sara has to do.

267
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,437
All Sara has been doing is running
away from the facts

268
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,172
because she's so afraid of being hurt.

269
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,697
But it's not right! Can't you understand?

270
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,678
Even though she might be hurt, she has
to be brave and strong-willed!

271
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:33,318
She'll be following after her father someday
and protecting the family by herself.

272
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,445
She has to be a strong person!

273
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,156
Ms. Sara...

274
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,429
Sara, I know you understand
what I'm thinking,

275
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,023
and the reason you have to do this.

276
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,723
Read my mind, Sara!

277
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,263
Find your bravery in my mind.

278
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,120
Sara, take my bravery.

279
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,795
Ms. Sara...

280
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,456
Please take mine too.

281
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,900
I can feel them.

282
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:29,004
Mr. Saeba, Ms. Kaori and Ms. Akiko,
their brave minds, strong minds.

283
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,516
What on earth are you guys doing there?!

284
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,983
Come here, Sara!

285
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,293
Sara, finally, you understand.

286
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,698
What the hell are you doing?
You weird little rat!?

287
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,132
What the hell are you doing?
You weird little rat?!

288
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,538
No way! She must be reading my mind?

289
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,508
No way! She must be reading my mind?

290
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,952
I can tell.

291
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,787
You killed my father.

292
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:20,451
And you tried to kill me, and tried to
take over the Nishikujo family.

293
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,863
You bribed the doctor, made him mix
poison into my father's medicine,

294
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,353
make his death look natural.

295
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,369
You hired assassins and tried to kill us.

296
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,497
How about that? Do you want
to hear the details?

297
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,805
No way! No way!

298
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,417
See.

299
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,452
His mask has been taken away.

300
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,221
What an ugly face!

301
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,822
You can't trick me!

302
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,358
This is a trick to get me.

303
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,292
What a poor loser!

304
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,686
Then why don't you look at that?

305
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,865
Mr. Sadamitsu!

306
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,480
These two confessed everything.

307
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,607
I'm so sorry, Mr. Sadamitsu.

308
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,016
Everybody, come out here!
What are you doing?

309
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,027
No way! What on earth happened here?

310
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,729
It was child's play for me to deal
with those soldiers.

311
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,469
Next time, you should hire better ones,

312
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,097
but I guess there won't be a next time.

313
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,814
Sara...

314
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,716
Mr. Saeba...

315
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,724
Mr. Saeba!

316
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,584
Good job! You really did a good job.

317
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,639
Well, take care, Sara.

318
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,640
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

319
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,245
When you grow up and look good in
that bathing suit, I'll be back.

320
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,075
There you go again.

321
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,852
Goodbye, Sara!

322
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,377
Ms. Akiko! Goodbye!

323
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,594
They're really, really good people.

324
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,027
Yes, they are.

325
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,532
Mr. Saeba has been bearing a
sadness beyond comparison

326
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,056
even with mine.

327
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,336
But he has overcome every one of them.

328
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,307
Those experiences make him attractive

329
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,775
to Ms. Kaori and Ms. Akiko and everyone.


330
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,602
Well, were you attracted to Mr. Saeba,
by any chance?

331
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:03,778
Well, if I met him before I met
your father, maybe.

332
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,460
Are you relieved because
I won't be your rival?

333
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,429
You don't want to have more rivals, do you?

334
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:13,565
But I might have lost.

335
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,201
But I might have lost.

Guitar o kikase ta katta

337
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,736
I guess I read Mr. Saeba's mind
a little too much.
