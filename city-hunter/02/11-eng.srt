1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,064
What? A request from the princess
to be her bodyguard?

13
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,066
I'm sorry, but the princess is a kid.

14
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:40,967
Don't worry.

15
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:45,205
Salina will be in the harem I'm
going to get as the reward.

16
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,740
But you can't have any mokkori
before you get the harem.

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,708
You would get the death penalty.

18
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,845
If I fear the death penalty,
then how will I do mokkori!?

19
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,872
Oh, my God! What is this noble aura?
I can't do mokkori!

20
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,080
I don't want to believe it
but she might be gay.

21
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,621
Oh, no! Princess Alma, who
switched identities with

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,624
her lady-in-waiting Salina, has run away
because she was so shocked!

23
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,353
What shall we do?

24
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:11,519
Mokkori Killer?!
The Princess's Noble Aura
(Part 2)

25
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:23,474
A man, Salina is a man.
She is the same as I am, a man.

26
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,113
Ryo!

27
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,583
Oh, my God! The princess, oh, no,
Salina ran away from here!

28
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,285
Hurry up and get her back!

29
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,820
Why don't we leave her alone?

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,421
What are you talking about!?

31
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,424
If the people from that country find
her, she'll be dragged back!

32
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:44,898
It's all right. Salina is a very
strong man, isn't she?

33
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,061
She's so strong that she can be the
bodyguard for the Princess.

34
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,404
Damn!

35
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:55,864
The princess followed Salina, so, please!

36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,945
I don't care.

37
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:03,348
You said Salina is a man, so I lost
all of my interest in this job.

38
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:09,987
It's a lie that Salina is a man.
Salina is a very nice woman!

39
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,152
What? Truly, one hundred percent,
she is a woman?

40
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,297
You idiot! Why did you tell me
a lie like that?!

41
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,500
Because we don't want you
to be close to Salina!

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,403
I see! You went that far, which means
she fell in love with me!

43
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,773
That's why you tried to keep me
away from her!

44
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,867
Hey, hey, nobody told you that.

45
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,245
Salina!

46
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,712
Oh, idiot! This floor is...

47
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,155
That man has no discretion.

48
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,248
I am not discouraged!

49
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:50,222
I'll be right there! Salina, wait for me!

50
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,826
I wish he would use that power
for something else.

51
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,664
Oh, no, I have to go look for her too.

52
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,488
How embarrassing!
Mr. Saeba thought I was a man.

53
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,615
Just thinking that makes my face
turn red as a beet.

54
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,426
What shall I do from now on?

55
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,862
I don't think I'll be able to look
Mr. Saeba in the face.

56
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,228
Don't say sad things like that.

57
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,602
Mr. Saeba...

58
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,400
I want to look at your face forever.

59
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,937
Wait, Salina, please.

60
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,646
Mr. Saeba...

61
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,511
I'm the one who is embarrassed
and can't look at you.

62
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,373
I was tricked by what they told me,
and I thought you were a man.

63
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:50,715
I put you, such a beautiful woman,
to shame. I am so sorry.

64
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,887
Please stand up. Men shouldn't do
things like this on the street.

65
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,932
No, compared to your embarrassment,
this is nothing.

66
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,163
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Saeba.

67
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,542
No aura?

68
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:14,580
I see. The aura was the rejecting reaction
of a girl who didn't know what love was.

69
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,013
That means...

70
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:22,084
Mr. Saeba, I... I have to tell you the truth.

71
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:30,463
He is a scary mokkori man.
He is perverted and a womanizer.

72
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,226
He chases beautiful women
whoever they are.

73
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,599
Well, why don't we go back?

74
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,243
I think I had better wait a little
longer to tell him the truth.

75
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,872
It was a very good mood. Why?

76
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,185
Salina!

77
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,850
Did you find her?

78
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:57,957
No, not yet.

79
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,584
Are you looking for someone?

80
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:04,656
We will help you if necessary,
Lady-in-waiting Salina.

81
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,533
You are the one who attacked the
princess today, aren't you?

82
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,000
Who is behind you guys?

83
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,572
You are very clever so I think
you already know who.

84
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,735
That's why you and the princess
disappeared at the airport.

85
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,799
Hey, what's going on?

86
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,505
Someone among the retainers
intends to murder the princess.

87
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,076
Well, Ms. Salina, you have to come with us.

88
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,786
Kaori, let's run!

89
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,253
Sure!

90
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:36,763
Hey, lady, tell the princess that if she
doesn't want us to kill Salina,

91
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,290
to come to Warehouse 7 at
Land Reclamation B by herself.

92
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,234
Come on!

93
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,002
Ms. Kaori, please don't worry about me.

94
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,972
Please tell Mr. Saeba the truth and
take the princess back to Celigia!

95
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,768
Shut up!

96
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,640
Wait!

97
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,436
If you do something stupid, we will
kill Salina! Understand?

98
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,480
Answer me!

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,970
Yes, I understand.

100
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,125
What the hell is going on here?

101
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,561
Why are the princess's retainers
trying to kill her?

102
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,763
Damn, nobody's home yet. I guess
they're still looking for you.

103
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,300
Well, I guess both of them will
be back shortly. Wait a sec.

104
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,274
This means, for a while,
Salina and I are alone.

105
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,886
I... I am going to look for the princess.

106
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,847
You don't need to worry about her at all.

107
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,391
But...

108
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,359
What's wrong?

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,626
Me? I won't do anything to you. Right?

110
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,522
But it's pretty late and I am
worried about her.

111
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,765
You can't distrust me that much, can you?

112
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,805
Nobody would trust you with
your face looking like that!

113
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,542
Damn! Why does she appear
like this every time?!

114
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,181
Damn! What are you doing at
this critical moment?!

115
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,378
Salina was, no, the princess
has been kidnapped!

116
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,599
Welcome, Ms. Salina.

117
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,737
Why don't you come out and show
your face, Minister Malmes?

118
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,749
You knew about us, as I thought.

119
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,479
That's why you ran away from
the airport, I think.

120
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,256
I wasn't really sure why you were trying
to take the princess's life,

121
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,156
since you don't have any right
to ascend the throne.

122
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,493
But finally I got it.

123
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,562
If you're going to take over Celigina
through military power,

124
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,396
Princess Alma is an obstacle for you
because the people love her.

125
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,037
Exactly. Indeed, you are the princess'
number one servant

126
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,597
and a genius with an IQ of 250.

127
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,510
We tried many times to kill her
by causing an accident,

128
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,603
but no matter what we did,
it failed because of you.

129
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:11,350
But that's it. You've been captured by me

130
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,286
and the princess is coming here
and she will be killed. I win.

131
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,523
No, the princess won't come here.

132
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,992
I already gave instructions to my
people to go back to our country

133
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,516
if a situation like this occurs.

134
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,196
You might have forgotten the reason

135
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,427
the princess is loved by the
people in our country.

136
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:34,431
I believe that the princess is
a very gentle woman.

137
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,983
Why didn't you tell me when you asked us
to guard you in the beginning?

138
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,086
There was no evidence that
Malmes was the leader,

139
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,748
and the previous incidents might
have been real accidents.

140
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,027
But why didn't they kill the princess quickly

141
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,829
and why did they tell Salina she
needs to go over there?

142
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,498
That's because...

143
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:04,959
Because Salina knew about Malmes's plot
and they would be in trouble if she was alive.

144
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:10,343
Well, I guess so, but what a stupid
princess she is! Damn!

145
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:10,643
Because of her, mokkori with
Salina was interrupted.

146
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,312
Princess, can you come here a second?
I have something to tell you.
Because of her, mokkori with
Salina was interrupted.

147
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:13,746
She is such an evil, unlucky omen.

148
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,581
I have a message from Salina.
She is such an evil, unlucky omen.

149
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,516
She told me that you must tell Ryo the
truth and go back to Celigina.

150
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,219
I was already told the same thing by her.

151
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:29,994
Salina foresaw the possibility of her capture
and gave me the same instructions.

152
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,056
Your Highness, then...

153
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:40,332
We grew up together just like sisters.
I can't leave without her.

154
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,067
Princess...

155
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,111
Mr. Saeba, please take me near the
place where they want me to go.

156
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,006
But if you do so, you will be in danger.

157
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,416
What the hell?! Your aura is revived again!

158
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,222
Aura revived? What is he screaming about?

159
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,156
Please, Mr. Saeba.

160
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,864
What is this girl? Does she have an
unusual physical feature?

161
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,771
Anyway, I can't let you go alone.

162
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,268
But if I don't, the princess will be killed.

163
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,881
Then you'll be killed as well.

164
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,849
I have a good idea.

165
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,318
Kaori, put this on.

166
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,945
What? A wig?

167
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,591
I get it. I'll go instead of Salina
by dressing up like her.

168
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,458
Exactly. If you put it on,
you'll look like a woman.

169
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,727
Idiot! I'm driving and it's dangerous!

170
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,818
It's too late. What the hell is the
princess doing?! She's way too late!

171
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,130
I told you. She is not coming.

172
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,198
Shut up!

173
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,733
Minister Malmes!

174
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,860
The princess is here and she is alone.

175
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,596
Ms. Salina, I guess I won.

176
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:27,341
All right. Let her in.
Keep watching around this area.

177
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,440
Yes, Sir. Come in.

178
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,979
Welcome, Princess. Ms. Salina is fine.

179
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,783
Your Highness, why did you come?!


180
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,989
Now, why don't you come here?

181
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:46,098
No, first, you have to release Salina,
or I'm not going in there.

182
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,828
What? Her voice? No way!

183
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,139
Idiot, do you think you can say things
like that in this situation?

184
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,572
Hurry up and come here!

185
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,103
I'm in trouble. Ryo, hurry up and help me!

186
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,113
Hi, I'm Ryo!

187
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,782
Who the hell are you?

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,909
I said, I'm Ryo.


189
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,014
You're suspicious.

190
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,756
Wow, all of you are fine, aren't you?

191
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:18,063
I thought you'd be tired because you
stayed up all night, didn't you?

192
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,098
Shut your mouth!

193
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,533
Get him!

194
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,093
What are you doing!? Hurry up
and come here! Damn!

195
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,563
Are you making more trouble for me
even at this final moment?

196
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,900
Hurry up, Ryo! He'll find out soon!

197
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,946
Hello, do you think I am beautiful?

198
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,774
Who the hell is this woman?!
She isn't the princess!

199
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,781
You were with Salina!

200
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,212
Yes, I was. Sorry.

201
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,491
Ms. Kaori!

202
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,859
You'll be all right, Salina!

203
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,394
Bitch!

204
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,330
You're fooling around too much!
You're prepared for this, aren't you?!

205
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,402
What?!

206
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:08,012
I don't like the idea of shooting
a person who isn't resisting.

207
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,182
Ryo, you're late!

208
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,150
Saeba!

209
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,954
Why are you here? What happened
to all the guards?

210
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,256
All of them were so tired because
they stayed up all night.

211
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,723
They're all sleeping.

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,967
Bastard!

213
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,208
Damn!

214
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,921
Now, I think I should make this
middle-aged man sleep forever

215
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,389
so that there won't be any trouble afterwards.

216
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,549
Forever? No way. Please help me!
I'll give you anything you want.

217
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:01,059
I don't want anything now because
I'll get the harem.

218
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:06,403
Harem? You want to have things like that?

219
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,706
How about this?

220
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,676
If you come over to my side, I'll give
you more than just a harem.

221
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,236
Why don't you make the whole
country into a harem?

222
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,482
The whole country?

223
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,919
Exactly! A paradise filled with women!
A sumptuous feast!

224
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,116
Enough of your nonsense!
You perverted minister!

225
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,693
Salina, no, Princess!

226
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,217
Salina!

227
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,123
Princess, why didn't you listen
to my instructions?

228
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,438
With you like this, I worry for the future,
even if you ascend the throne!

229
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,066
Indeed, that's why I need you.

230
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,638
Finally, everything is done.

231
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:50,783
Hey you, if you untie my rope, I'll make
the entire Earth your harem.

232
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,319
What? Hey, you aren't lying to me, are you?

233
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,120
Can you do something like that?

234
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,357
Oh, my God. Those two had
better die at least once.
Can you do something like that?

235
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:58,686
Can you do something like that?

236
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,131
Looking good!

237
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,095
Date?

238
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,639
Yes!

239
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,802
Yes? Why do you say yes to
something like that?

240
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:21,246
I've heard that Saeba asked the
princess to go out on a date

241
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,180
as his reward for rescuing me,
instead of a harem.

242
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,851
Such a jerk! As I thought, he wants
an immediate reward

243
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,409
rather than waiting until later.

244
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,918
Well, I had better get ready to go.

245
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,020
Excuse me, Your Highness. You don't
need to keep a promise to Ryo.

246
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,794
Yes, I do. A promise is a promise.

247
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,069
Salina, why didn't you stop her?

248
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,206
It's reckless to let her go out on a
date with Ryo. It's dangerous!

249
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:51,343
It will be all right. Saeba can't get
close to the princess' aura.

250
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,712
She sure is from the blood of
the imperial family.

251
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,081
She has that noble aura.

252
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,175
Why are you impressed by nonsense
at a time like this?!

253
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,288
Ryo is just puzzled by the
mysterious aura now.

254
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,957
If he finds out she is the real princess,

255
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,391
he'll break the aura with his
mokkori power, I'm sure!

256
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,697
The princess has no intention of
telling him the truth anymore.

257
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,799
So, you don't need to worry about that.

258
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,993
I hope so.

259
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,690
Is Ryo home?

260
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,270
Reika!

261
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,538
I did it, Ms. Kaori!

262
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,531
I asked my sister and got the picture of
the princess and her lady-in-waiting.

263
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,609
Here, look, look! This is
Lady-in-waiting Salina.

264
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,752
You're Lady-in-waiting Salina!

265
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,654
No, not her, Reika. She is not.

266
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,020
Hey, Reika, what makes you so noisy?

267
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,162
Ryo! Do you know who that lady is?

268
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,960
She is Princess Alma from Celigia!

269
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,567
What are you waiting for, Ryo?
You're going out on a date, aren't you?

270
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,769
Hurry up or you won't have enough time!

271
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,771
What the hell are you doing anyway?!

272
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,103
Well, don't worry about us.
Hurry up and go and have fun!

273
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:27,673
Mr. Saeba, thank you very much.
I had so much fun during my stay.

274
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,608
These will be my best memories.

275
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,906
There is one more place
I want to take you to.

276
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,557
Excuse me, Mr. Saeba, but
where are we going?

277
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,785
Don't worry.

278
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,566
Well, this is it. Here.

279
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,862
Here? What do you mean?

280
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,437
Here you go.

281
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,671
This place!

282
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,026
Wow, how beautiful!

283
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,162
This is the roof top of the super skyscraper.

284
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,789
Not many people have a
chance to come here.

285
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,367
A person like me, who lives in
the underground world,

286
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,995
only sees the dirty parts of the town.

287
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,472
Sometimes, I want to get the hell
out of a dirty town like this.

288
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,808
During times like that, I come here.

289
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,608
Then, I start feeling that this
place is not so bad.

290
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,682
This is my favorite place.

291
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,480
This is the only place where
I can see my dream.

292
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,520
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

293
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,790
I won't forget the scenery
from here in my lifetime.

294
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,884
You are exactly the man I expected.

295
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,925
I think my dream will come true
while I'm here.

296
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,328
Your dream. What is it?

297
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,064
Do you want to know? Then, close your eyes.

298
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,937
Why?

299
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,271
Don't ask, please.

300
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,239
Sure, I understand.

301
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:44,141
Ryo, what have you been doing?
You're late. They're leaving soon.

302
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,310
Oh, I'm sorry. The road was congested.

303
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,307
Now, you didn't do anything
to Salina, did you?

304
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,553
Of course, I didn't do anything. I didn't.

305
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,545
You sound too sincere.
You did something, didn't you?

306
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,987
Well, Your Highness and Ms. Salina,
we say goodbye here.

307
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,716
Mr. Saeba!

308
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,127
Well, I... I...

309
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,406
No matter who you are...

310
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,576
To me, you are Lady-in-waiting
Salina, an ordinary woman.

311
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:49,540
Your Highness, he is a wonderful
guard as you said.

312
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:58,009
Ryo Saeba, no, he is more than words.

313
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,987
Ryo, did you know?

314
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,094
Know what?

315
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:32,914
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

316
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:37,389
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

317
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,120
You skip dinner and eat diet food

318
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:48,259
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

319
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,671
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

320
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,004
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

321
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:03,108
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

322
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:12,187
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

323
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,092
Don't you, don't you know

324
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:20,465
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

325
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:28,304
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

326
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:34,204
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

327
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,713
Here she is! Her fatal weapon, Drop Kick!

328
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,523
This is one of the extreme sports!
I got hooked on it!

329
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,258
Kumi Akamatsu, she's cool!

330
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,827
But why? I see some kind of shadow
in her eyes sometimes.

331
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,262
She seems like she's afraid of someone.

332
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,563
I can't forgive a put-up job.

333
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,799
Exactly, smash the yakuza at once!

334
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,933
Well, shall we?

335
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,569
Sure! It's a female pro wrestler troop
vs. Yakuza battle royal!

336
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,804
City Hunter 2:

337
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,873
"Must Be the Bloody Battle Outside the Ring!
