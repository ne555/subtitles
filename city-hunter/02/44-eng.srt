Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Mayonaka no lady, hitogomi ni magire

Utsurigi na steppin' kurikaeshite iru

Odori akashite mo

Oh, Sarah, akirame nai de,

Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,063
Do you remember Kasumi Asou,

14
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,365
who wore the sailor outfit
and had a flying tush?

15
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,801
She's grown up and now she's
a college student.

16
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,336
She came to see me.

17
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,904
Because of the rules of her thief family,

18
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,340
she's going to be forced to
marry a guy she hates.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,075
In order to refuse, she asked
you to be her lover.

20
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,177
I have to compete with my thieving skills
against Takashi, who's a hypnotist.

21
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,546
I'm in trouble!

22
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:59,152
I was hypnotized by him and my mokkori
power was taken hostage.

23
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,055
Ryo without mokkori power, oh, no.

24
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,649
I won't be able to have mokkori any more.

25
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:10,485
Ryo is the Love Thief!
Hidden Love Affair Behind the Magic Mirror
(Part 2)

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,403
Ryo, wake up! How long do you
need to sleep?

27
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,939
No way, I'm tired.

28
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,741
I'm going to pass on the training today.

29
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,710
It would be impossible to train today,
even if you wanted to,

30
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,577
because Kasumi is gone. Hey, wake up!

31
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,313
No, I can't let him get involved.

32
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,192
I don't want to make Mr. Saeba suffer
because of my selfishness.

33
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,219
Everything will be solved if I give up.

34
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,342
You're now telling me you'll marry me,

35
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,038
therefore you want me to release him
from the hypnotic state.

36
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,810
Yes.

37
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,019
You love Saeba that much, I guess.

38
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,456
I thought he was just a tool to cancel
the engagement with me.

39
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,259
It's none of your business.

40
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,726
What's your answer?

41
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,597
Sure.

42
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,898
Really?

43
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,763
But in order to prove what you said,

44
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,539
why don't we do it right now
as husband and wife?

45
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,486
Who did this?!

46
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,088
You should be grateful that it wasn't a knife.


47
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:48,119
If it was, your snobby nose
would have been gone.

48
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,496
Jerk, when did you get here?!

49
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,022
Mr. Saeba!

50
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,203
Let's go home.

51
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,504
But I...

52
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,668
I only have one day left for the
special training, teacher.

53
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,310
Mr. Saeba...

54
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,510
Wait! Jerk, you can't leave!

55
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,214
It will be tomorrow before I see you again.

56
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,053
Bye.

57
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,323
Why are you still going to do this?

58
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,423
If I give up, you'll be able to
get your power back.

59
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,457
It's a simple plan, isn't it?

60
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:34,240
I'm sure you really thought you were right,
and the rule was stupid.

61
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,506
I can't believe that you're
giving up that easily.

62
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,212
Oh, no.

63
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,848
But...

64
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,440
Then, believe me.

65
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,686
Once I accept a request from
a client, I complete it.

66
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,916
That's the pride of being a professional.

67
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,889
Mr. Saeba!

68
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,264
Takashi is a master of hypnosis,

69
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,867
but his physical abilities are nothing special.

70
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,062
I know you won't lose, if you can be yourself.

71
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,835
But I feel he's not the same as usual.

72
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,272
Well, it might be because he doesn't
have his wild mokkori power.

73
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,269
Do you think he has a chance to win?

74
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,708
We have to do something.

75
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,363
Hi, how are you, Grandma?

76
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,731
You're late.

77
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,734
The other leaders and I were
about to give up on you.

78
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,369
I see.

79
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,439
These old men are judges, aren't they?

80
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,737
And you are the leader of
the judges, aren't you?

81
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,307
I thought you ran away because
you got scared.

82
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,307
Now, leaders, would you please
start explaining the game?

83
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,283
The target you need to steal tonight is...

84
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,831
This.

85
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:10,269
There's a mirror just like this one
where a mirror craftsman lives.

86
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,573
Whichever one can steal it faster, wins.

87
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,174
That's it?

88
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,039
That's what it's all about?

89
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,772
It's too easy for the final test.

90
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,216
But, Grandma...

91
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,435
The mirror...

92
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,072
A reflection on the ceiling?

93
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,673
Mr. Saeba, what are you looking at?

94
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,208
Nothing.

95
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,676
This is the mirror. Look at it very carefully.

96
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,387
Now, time to start.

97
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,122
Wait a second, Grandma.

98
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,658
I don't see Kasumi. Where is she?

99
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,185
You really don't know how to speak
properly to your elders, do you?

100
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,268
Kasumi?

101
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,571
Wow, it's been a while since I've seen
you in that mokkori leotard.

102
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,474
What's the matter with you,
in an outfit like that?

103
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,533
Grandma, I have a favor to ask.

104
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,546
Mr. Saeba is an amateur.

105
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,247
Please give him a handicap.

106
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,083
As his handicap, please
let me be his support.

107
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,448
What?

108
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,053
No.

109
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,655
But...

110
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,390
I don't care.

111
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,293
A handicap is necessary.

112
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,963
I was thinking that this game would be no fun
for me because he's an amateur.

113
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:48,434
When they understand they can't win
even with both of them trying,

114
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,994
Kasumi will marry me without
saying anything.

115
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,771
Okay, if you say so.

116
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,907
I give you permission to be his support.

117
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,914
I didn't expect you to hate me that much.

118
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,650
I'm so happy just thinking that
you'll be mine soon.

119
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,917
Ready? Start!

120
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:32,345
Kasumi, I kind of understand
how you feel, but...

121
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,937
The rule is the rule.

122
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,476
Follow me closely, Mr. Saeba.

123
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,723
Wow, I'm so happy.

124
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,325
The Flying Tush is still fine.

125
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,461
My cute tush!

126
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,894
How embarrassing!

127
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,669
I see, since he doesn't have
any mokkori power,

128
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,572
she needs to guide him like that
or he can't do anything.

129
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,064
However, from my point of view,
it's more complicated than that.

130
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,580
I can't believe they gave me
a sketch of the house.

131
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,649
This is too easy.

132
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,464
Please accept my thanks for spreading
rumors about me all over town.

133
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,193
Now you learn, snob!

134
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,037
You jerk, Saeba!

135
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,006
How dare you damage such a
beautiful face as mine?!

136
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,176
However, no matter how you struggle,

137
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,278
the winner is already decided, and it's me.

138
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,475
May you live your entire life
without any mokkori!

139
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,043
Anyway, about this test,
my feelings are mixed.

140
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,820
What do you mean?

141
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,759
Our family is prohibited from stealing
something for ourselves.

142
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,129
When we receive a request, we judge
whether the request is fair or not.

143
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,393
If it's fair, we take back something
which had been stolen before.

144
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,070
However, Grandma is making us steal
something without a good reason.

145
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,230
It's the first time.

146
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:10,301
Kasumi, who is Yayoi Asou?

147
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,846
It's Grandma's name,

148
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,337
but how do you know that?

149
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,508
Well, not a big deal.

150
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,399
If the sketch is correct, it
should be in this room.

151
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,011
That's it.

152
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,353
What? Is it stuck or something?

153
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,733
Ryo!

154
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,970
Hold me! Please!

155
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,437
What?

156
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,473
Ryo!

157
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,368
Damn, this must be Takashi's trap
in order to stop me here.

158
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,543
What are you talking about?!

159
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,445
Hurry!

160
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,657
Oh, no, I can't take my eyes off her!

161
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,629
Mokkori, mokkori, powerful mokkori!

162
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,773
Kasumi!

163
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,071
Mr. Saeba, your mokkori is back, isn't it?!

164
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,177
Yes, because of you!

165
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,585
What am I doing like this?!

166
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,214
I guess you were put into
a state of hypnosis,

167
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,989
so that when you saw the mirror,
you would start tempting me.

168
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,327
But because of that, my mokkori is back!

169
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,861
Where did the mirror go?!

170
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,566
I didn't expect that, but my
goal is accomplished.

171
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,034
I have the mirror!

172
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,580
I got you twice with the same trick.
Now, Kasumi is mine!

173
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,082
Wait, you coward!

174
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,454
What is it, Mr. Saeba?

175
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,092
I can get the mirror back now! Let me go!

176
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,753
You don't need to.

177
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,927
Oh, no, the resident heard us.

178
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,370
Go without me.

179
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,305
I have something to do here.

180
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,207
What are you going to do?

181
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,642
You might be caught!

182
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,110
Don't worry.

183
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,977
Please try to gain time until
I get back. Later.

184
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,745
Mr. Saeba?

185
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,969
I wonder if he was caught or if he ran away?

186
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,802
Great Aunt, I think it's useless
to wait for him any longer.

187
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,073
Please admit that I have won this game.

188
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,344
What are you talking about?!

189
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,880
He got the mirror faster than you,

190
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,583
but you used cowardly hypnotism
and snatched it!

191
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,051
Sure I did.

192
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:44,123
But you knew about it, so it was
your mistake not to plan for it.

193
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,488
What the hell?!

194
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,985
He's right, Kasumi.

195
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,631
Okay, I consider that Saeba
gave up the game.

196
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,800
Now, I'll give you my judgment.

197
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,267
Wait!

198
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,798
Hi, how are you doing?

199
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,903
Mr. Saeba!

200
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,311
What on earth were you doing until now?!

201
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,613
Calm down. Don't worry.

202
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,878
This game has been won by me.

203
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,917
What? What are you talking about, after
you came back here late like this?!

204
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,657
You think you won? What do you mean?

205
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:25,323
After all, this was not a simple
competition of stealing skills.

206
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:27,958
What?!

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,929
Well, before my explanation,

208
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,227
I want you to look at something.

209
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,475
Takashi, turn the mirror this way.

210
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,533
What?

211
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,648
That's enough! What do you want?!

212
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,845
Look at the reflection of
this mirror on the wall.

213
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,921
Reflection?

214
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,260
The fast stream of the river,
reaches the rock in the river.
The stream is divided into
two because of the rock.
But it will combine later.
Just like the stream, we
will see each other later.

215
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,795
The fast stream of the river,
reaches the rock in the river.
The stream is divided into
two because of the rock.
But it will combine later.
Just like the stream, we
will see each other later.
There are letters in the reflection.

216
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,598
The fast stream of the river,
reaches the rock in the river.
The stream is divided into
two because of the rock.
But it will combine later.
Just like the stream, we
will see each other later.
But why? There aren't any
letters on the mirror!

217
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,100
The fast stream of the river,
reaches the rock in the river.
The stream is divided into
two because of the rock.
But it will combine later.
Just like the stream, we
will see each other later.
It's a magic mirror.

218
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,498
The fast stream of the river,
reaches the rock in the river.
The stream is divided into
two because of the rock.
But it will combine later.
Just like the stream, we
will see each other later.

219
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,234
Magic mirror?

220
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,171
Don't move.

221
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,548
There are letters on the back of the mirror!

222
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,022
This was made with a special process

223
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,822
and letters or pictures will appear
only in the reflection.

224
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,022
A mirror like this is called a magic mirror.

225
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,293
But how do you know?

226
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,266
Lightning.

227
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,569
Before the game started,

228
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,840
Grandma showed us the mirror and, just
then, the lightning reflected on the mirror

229
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,467
and I saw those same letters.

230
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,446
Therefore, I thought this mirror was the same.

231
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,815
Oh, at that moment, such a short time!

232
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,339
He is good!

233
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:58,422
So what? I won because I stole that
mirror and brought it here.

234
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,681
You still don't get it?

235
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,862
This is one of the old waka
from the Shika Wakashu.

236
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,762
What? Waka?

237
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,025
Se o hayami, iwa ni sekakaru takigawa no.

238
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,998
Wakarete mo, sue ni, awan tozo omou.

239
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,078
The stream runs very fast.

240
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,247
The stream hits the rock and the stream
is divided into two streams.

241
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,613
However, later, those two streams
combine into one again.


242
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,920
This waka is about a dramatic love affair,

243
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,821
about lovers who had to separate.

244
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,731
I get it, Mr. Saeba.

245
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,757
We shouldn't have stolen this mirror, right?

246
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,460
What?!

247
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,374
I think this mirror was made by
lovers who had to separate.

248
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:53,379
They instilled it with their hope to meet
again, and they each kept one.

249
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,076
This mirror might be worth more
than their life to the owner.

250
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,978
We shouldn't take something like this
regardless of the situation.

251
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,625
Mr. Saeba, you didn't steal this

252
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,217
because you found out the meaning
of this mirror, didn't you?

253
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,897
Then, the purpose of this test
might have been to find out

254
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,134
how much the person understands the
meaning of our family business.

255
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,103
It sounds old-fashioned, but I guess so.
Right, Grandma?

256
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,141
You are so conceited, aren't you, Takashi?

257
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,871
You forgot the pride and the heart
of our family, didn't you?

258
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,913
You are neither qualified to
be Kasumi's husband,

259
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,649
nor to take our family name.

260
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,344
Go away right now!

261
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,756
No way...

262
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,027
I'm impressed, Saeba.

263
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,463
You understand our family so well.

264
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,300
Saeba, we welcome you as a member
of our family, and as Kasumi's...

265
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,031
Wait, I'm not qualified to be
her husband either.

266
00:17:54,973 --> 00:18:00,878
I was hired by Kasumi only to cancel
her engagement to Takashi.

267
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,338
Mr. Saeba!

268
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,350
And one more thing.

269
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,840
This magic mirror has a secret.

270
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,856
This mirror is one of two which
were kept by two lovers

271
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,092
who wished to meet again.

272
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,289
I wonder why you have one of them?

273
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:21,266
Also, there is more than just
the waka in your mirror.

274
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,501
Yayoi Asou
Also, there is more than just
the waka in your mirror.

275
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,130
Yayoi Asou
Yayoi Asou, your name is written in it.

276
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,503
There is only one answer.

277
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,646
A long time ago,

278
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,877
you fell in love with someone who
was not a member of the family.

279
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,854
However, because of the strict family rules,

280
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:46,223
you and the owner of this mirror
had to be separated.

281
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:52,490
I met a man in the house, who
woke up because of the noise.

282
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:59,294
I'm sorry, but your man passed
away a long time ago.

283
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,305
But he never forgot about
you until he died.

284
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:08,711
He died holding this mirror
and calling your name.

285
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,584
One more thing to add,

286
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,521
the man I met there was adopted,

287
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:21,323
so your lover didn't marry, because
he missed you too much.

288
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,940
I thought that my tears had
dried up back then.

289
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,617
He left a dying wish.

290
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,554
He said that he hadn't been able
to see you while he was alive,

291
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,022
but he wished that the mirror would
make its way back to you.

292
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,786
I'm sorry if I reopened old wounds,

293
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,795
but now, you've got your tears back,

294
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:09,575
so I think you won't force your grandchild to
have the same sad experience as you did.

295
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,304
Mr. Saeba!

296
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,352
Saeba, you jerk!

297
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,222
I'm going to make sure that you can never
have mokkori for the rest of your life

298
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,747
by using permanent hypnosis.

299
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,120
Saeba, eat this!

300
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,208
Idiot, did you think you'd be able to use
the same trick again and again?

301
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:51,839
Oh, no! I hypnotized myself in a way
which can never be undone!

302
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,514
Kasumi!

303
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,594
Grandma...

304
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,255
You greenhorn!

305
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,929
Your heart has been completely
stolen by Saeba, hasn't it?

306
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,128
Oh, no!

307
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,572
I...

308
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,841
It's our way to steal back what was stolen.

309
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,366
You can't come back home until you do this.

310
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,149
You must steal Saeba's heart.

311
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,310
That is the condition to cancel the family rule.

312
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,385
Grandma!

313
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,782
I wish I had been brave enough
back then, just like you.

314
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:48,674
Therefore, I'm not able to go back home
until I steal your heart.

315
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:53,941
So, I decided to try and get you
while I stay here and work.

316
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,017
Ryo, you're incredible!
You're so attractive to girls.

317
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,986
So, I'm pleased to meet you again.

318
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,624
Well, you say that, but shouldn't the
priority be a mokkori as my reward?

319
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,527
No, only after you let me steal it.

320
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,394
I see.

321
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,727
I'll give you one!

322
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:13,665
Guitar o kikase ta katta

323
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,434
I don't need you!
Guitar o kikase ta katta

324
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,636
Oh, don't hesitate like that! Here you go!
Guitar o kikase ta katta

325
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,136
Oh, don't hesitate like that! Here you go!
Ai o todoke ta katta

326
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,264

Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

336
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,487
I'm invited to the house of a beautiful lady.

337
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,257
But who are those people around Ayako?

338
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,492
Foreign cars, female boss, cutting
fingers off, what do you think?

339
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,927
A yakuza family, just as I thought!


340
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,996
Aya's the widow of the late fourth
