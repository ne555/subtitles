1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:16,049
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:25,481
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,795
Lady in the middle of the night,
blended in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:41,399
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,379
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,711
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,686
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,985
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:05,031
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:12,072
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:19,679
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:29,645
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,503
We're late for the meeting.

14
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,834
Let's hurry up, Ryo!

15
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,173
Thank you.

16
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,676
You're welcome. By the way, lady,

17
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,507
why don't we go out and have some coffee
together after you visit the patient?

18
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,240
What the hell are you doing?
We've got to go to work?!

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,253
Because this is a kind of illness
I've had for a long time, so...

20
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,989
If you're ill, you should get better
after being treated in here.

21
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,859
Then I'm going to be admitted here
and have fun with angels

22
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,094
who wear white uniforms and then...

23
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,062
What?

24
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,264
We have to work before you
can be admitted here.

25
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,788
Oh, my angels!

26
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:18,238
Wounded Innocence!
A Bullet and an Angel's Prayer

27
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:18,638
Maiko Tonegawa

28
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,573
Maiko Tonegawa
No, I said no!

29
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,130
Maiko Tonegawa

30
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,641
This is it.

31
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,744
Absolutely not!

32
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,113
Maiko, don't get so excited.

33
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:27,313
It's not good for you.

34
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,610
No!
It's not good for you.

35
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,650
Yes!

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,653
I won't have the surgery unless
that man comes to see me!

37
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,821
I won't!

38
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,788
Excuse me!

39
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,084
Hey, Ryo, wake up!

40
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,295
Hey!

41
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,190
Are you sure you're okay?

42
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,369
He's fine.

43
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,098
He trains himself everyday.

44
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:55,575
Instead of talking about him, I've heard
your daughter has a heart problem.

45
00:02:55,575 --> 00:03:00,813
Yes, but her doctor guarantees she'll
be fine after the operation.

46
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,150
However, she really hates the idea
of having surgery.

47
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,448
I see. By the way, how old is your daughter?

48
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,788
She is sixteen.

49
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,889
Sixteen...

50
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,924
That's too bad.

51
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,593
Ryo! What the hell are you thinking?!

52
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,361
Does her age present any
problems or something?

53
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,996
No, nothing really.

54
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,089
Well, please continue to tell us about her.

55
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:27,373
I tried to convince her to have the operation.

56
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:33,379
Then she said to me, "Bring that man to me,
then I'll have the surgery."

57
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,641
That man? Who is it?

58
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,250
It happened last month.

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,652
Maiko snuck out of the hospital
without telling anybody

60
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,313
while the nurses weren't looking.

61
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,625
Hey, girl, hurry up and go home.

62
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,262
It's no fun if you catch cold.

63
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,944
Here.

64
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,615
Excuse me...

65
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,115
Bye!

66
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,582
Excuse me!

67
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,650
Maiko!

68
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,526
Finally, I've found you. I'm so relieved.

69
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,825
Momma, that man gave me this
umbrella and coat.

70
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,371
I only saw him from behind.

71
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,572
I see...

72
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,008
That man seems like a good yakuza
in an old yakuza movie.

73
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,171
Your daughter fell in love with
that man, didn't she?

74
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:43,316
Maiko insists that she won't have
surgery unless he is with her.

75
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,376
Then, what we need to do is find him, isn't it?


76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,688
Can you do that?

77
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,223
Yes, of course.

78
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,557
This is our job.

79
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,024
Right, Ryo?

80
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,456
Where did he go?

81
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,264
Excuse me, but could you give me
your phone number?

82
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,391
Why don't we go out on a date
when you get off work?

83
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,935
You look like you don't want to work on
this mission at all, do you?

84
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,409
But Kaori, she's only sixteen years old.

85
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,480
Basically, my policy is not to work for
girls under eighteen years old.

86
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,349
I see, I understand.

87
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:16,916
Yes...

88
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,051
Are you stupid?

89
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,612
She's sixteen now, but in two years,
she is going to be eighteen.

90
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,858
If you keep fishing, the number of
fish is going to decrease.

91
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,759
You need to raise fish and make the effort to
increase the number of fish, don't you?

92
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,157
I see, raise them...

93
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,536
It might be a good idea to
raise girls for the future.

94
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,738
The technique of saving money
in the low interest era,

95
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,073
the technique of saving beautiful girls...

96
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,041
Compound interest in ten years,
no tax, high return...

97
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,536
Then, tons of beautiful girls come back
to me more and more.

98
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,651
Trust me, Mother.

99
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,688
I, Ryo Saeba, will take full responsibility
for your daughter's happiness.

100
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,918
Well, thank you very much for
accepting my request.

101
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,119
That jerk. I wonder if he's actually
going to go through with the idea?

102
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,503
You can't be just a messenger
forever, right, Tetsu?

103
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,473
Yes, Sir, you are absolutely right, Mr. Gonzo.

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,922
Ken and Masa will lead you.

105
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,125
Be a man, Tetsu, the Errand Boy.

106
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,226
Yes, Sir.

107
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,660
I'm going to give you that gun. Keep it.

108
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,256
Thank you so much.

109
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,329
The real thing... A real gun...

110
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,740
What the hell are you doing?

111
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,575
Pump yourself up! Pump up!


112
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,810
Sorry!

113
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,412
This is the first time I've had to kill someone.

114
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,013
I am good at running, but...

115
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,482
I really don't know what we're going
to do with you. It'll be all right.

116
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,919
Once you do it, then you'll be able to
do it again easier than before.

117
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,254
Really?

118
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,288
Yes, it is.

119
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,389
Let's go.

120
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,482
Hey, heads up, dumb ass!

121
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,762
Do you think he'll be all right?

122
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,131
The enemy is the famous City Hunter.

123
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,166
Don't worry.

124
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,635
Tetsu is just a bullet we hired for now.

125
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,737
Even if he fails, we won't lose anything.

126
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,103
Really, you are so clever.

127
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,843
After getting rid of Saeba,
I'll be a big shot in Tokyo.

128
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,539
Exchanging Tetsu's life for all that
is a very good deal.

129
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:33,184
Maiko Tonegawa

130
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,760
Guest
Elevator

131
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,228
Maiko!

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,127
You can't go out, my ten-year,
compound interest, no-tax girl.

133
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,374
If I'm patient for two more years,
this girl will be good to go.

134
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,280
You are the middle-aged man
I threw the flower vase at.

135
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,406
Middle-aged man?

136
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,647
I, a young man, am a professional detective.
I find missing persons.

137
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,489
A professional who finds missing persons?

138
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,792
Yes, your momma has been worried
about you so she hired me.

139
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,661
Did Momma actually hire you?

140
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,329
Yes...

141
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,057
No!

142
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,595
Impossible, impossible, it's so impossible!

143
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,133
It's impossible to find him.

144
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,269
Nobody in Tokyo knows where he is.

145
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,105
Are you going to be in trouble if I find him?

146
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,902
Oh, not really.

147
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,210
If I can't find him, you won't
get the operation.

148
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,677
That's what you are thinking, aren't you?

149
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,149
The story about the umbrella might
have been a lie too.

150
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,117
No! It's true!

151
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,889
Why won't you accept the surgery
without struggling?

152
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,653
After you're healthy, you'll be able to
go out without hiding like this.

153
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,129
I hate surgery.

154
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,264
Are you scared?

155
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,865
No!

156
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,267
I hate it.

157
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,495
I hate hospitals too.

158
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:02,975
I have a good idea.

159
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,705
Let's look for that man together.

160
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,615
I'm the only person who knows his face.

161
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,249
Right?

162
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,945
If you say so, but Maiko, you
have a heart problem.

163
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,887
I'll be fine.

164
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,354
I have medicine with me.

165
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,724
Right?

166
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,761
On top of that, if I get sick, we can
come back here immediately.

167
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,322
Oh, no, you make it sound like
it's very easy, but...

168
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,607
Time to go.

169
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,596
Yes, Sir.

170
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:46,319
I don't think it's a good idea to take
Maiko out of the hospital.

171
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,887
I had no choice.

172
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,889
She said she wanted to go out.

173
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,092
Also, she's the only one who knows his face.

174
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,152
But she's a patient.

175
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,858
Exit to Gaien
Shinanomachi, Aoyama Area

176
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,701
Maiko, this is Harajuku.
Is this the right place?

177
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,879
I thought you met the man who let you
have his umbrella in Shinjuku?

178
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,747
It's okay.

179
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,113
I don't think he stayed in Shinjuku that long.

180
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,752
Well, you might be right, but...

181
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,844
Stop the car!

182
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,991
Did you find him? The umbrella man?

183
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,058
What an incredible coincidence!

184
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,025
Wait!
What an incredible coincidence!

185
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,776
Here you go.

186
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,572
I really wanted to eat this.

187
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,909
You were in line for that ice cream shop.

188
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,613
It's cold.

189
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,013
Wow, it's so cute!

190
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,947
Oh, boy.

191
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,279
I wonder if Maiko is serious about
looking for him or not?

192
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,923
What's the matter, Maiko?

193
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,666
Is he the one?

194
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,133
No way...

195
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,605
I...

196
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,074
Just for a little while.

197
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,510
If you take this hand, I'll think
you're not leaving me.

198
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,444
But that's...

199
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,575
Your kindness, I can feel it through
this beautiful hand.

200
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,518
What a beautiful woman you are!

201
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,645
Would you please accept this present?

202
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,491
The rose has bloomed.

203
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,924
How beautiful!

204
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,089
How interesting!

205
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,664
That guy!

206
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,623
Yes, in episodes 43 and 65,
he interrupted me so much.

207
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,837
An evil man!

208
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,804
What's wrong?

209
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,730
I have to go now.

210
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,138
I don't want to leave you, but...

211
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,836
Please take these roses on my behalf.

212
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,014
Goodbye...

213
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:29,810
But...

214
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,121
Wait a second!

215
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,589
What's the matter, Maiko?

216
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,023
He's the one you were looking for, isn't he?

217
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,091
We should chase him.

218
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,159
No way.

219
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,260
It's not him.

220
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,557
But you were...

221
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:47,299
That man and woman looked cool,
so I was watching them.

222
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:51,201
I thought I would like to have a date
like them someday.

223
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,105
Oh, that's not him?

224
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,475
Two years from now, I will have a date
with you. After two years, okay?

225
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,942
Too persistent!

226
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,871
It hurts.

227
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,250
Look, he is the City Hunter.

228
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,818
Him?

229
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,620
Kill him and you will become the man!

230
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,087
Go, Tetsu!

231
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,463
Be the man...

232
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,565
Be the man...

233
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,233
I'm gonna be the man!

234
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,539
Ryo Saeba!

235
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,637
Be ready!

236
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,707
What an idiot!

237
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,286
Hello!

238
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,753
Who the hell is this guy?

239
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,864
You're the one, as I thought!

240
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,066
Maiko, is he the one?

241
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,401
He really exists!

242
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,337
Oh, no, not this man.

243
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,072
He's not the one who let me
borrow his umbrella.

244
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,674
I just know him.

245
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,576
Hey, come, come with me!

246
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,376
Maiko!

247
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,365
Wait!

248
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,679
Hey, don't run!

249
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,613
Maiko!
Hey, don't run!

250
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:07,977
Maiko!


251
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,841
What the hell is Tetsu doing?

252
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,690
Mr. Tetsu, you're a good man.

253
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,724
You mean me?

254
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,860
Because you let me borrow your
umbrella and coat.

255
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,161
Oh, that.

256
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,231
Well, my late grandma used to tell me
all the time to be kind

257
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,966
to old people or people who are in trouble.

258
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,957
I see. You're great.

259
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,371
Compared to you, I'm a bad girl.

260
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,440
I used a good person like you.

261
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,908
Used?

262
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,443
What do you mean?

263
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,280
I told my momma that I wouldn't have
surgery unless I meet you.

264
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,985
However, now I'm meeting you so
I can't say no to the surgery.

265
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,453
I'm in trouble.

266
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,520
Surgery?

267
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,680
What's wrong?

268
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,423
It's not a big deal.

269
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,653
I can go out like this.

270
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,895
Well, I guess so.

271
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,529
You look fine.

272
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,898
No one thinks you're ill.

273
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,632
Do you think so?

274
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,933
Yes!

275
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm glad to hear that.

276
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,471
By the way, where did those two people go?

277
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,773
I wonder if they went home?

278
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,375
They might be in the car.

279
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,865
Yes, that car.

280
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,012
In the car...

281
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,446
Good, I'll still be able to be the man.

282
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,082
What's the matter?

283
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,350
You look scary.

284
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,084
No, nothing.

285
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,655
Well, I have to go pee, well,
the bathroom, so...

286
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,782
If you need to go, I saw restrooms over there.

287
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,168
Maiko denied it but that man is the one
she was looking for, I guess.

288
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,294
I don't know.

289
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,514
City Hunter, I won't fail this time.

290
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,552
What are you doing?

291
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,918
City Hunter, when did you...

292
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,657
Wow, you know me very well, don't you?

293
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,550
Damn! What a dumb ass!

294
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,662
In a situation like this...

295
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,901
Hey, are you the man Maiko
has been looking for?

296
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,300
What do you mean?

297
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,071
Don't try to fool me.

298
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,538
You might have to die and it
depends on your answer.

299
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,335
Maiko's shoe!

300
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:24,984
Maiko!

301
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,784
Mister!
Maiko!

302
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,686
Where is he taking Maiko?!

303
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,821
I don't know.

304
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,389
He did it without telling me!

305
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,458
Maiko has a heart problem.

306
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,892
If she has an attack...

307
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,427
A heart problem?

308
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,563
But she is active and looked fine.

309
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,864
Her heart needs to be operated on.

310
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:44,427
But she refused surgery until she met the
man who let her borrow his umbrella!

311
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,872
Your target is me, not her.

312
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,208
She has nothing to do with you,
but they kidnapped her,

313
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,577
in order to entice me, didn't they?

314
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,602
Where? Where did he take her?!

315
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,150
Warehouse 7 in Harumi.

316
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,777
Hurry up, Kaori!

317
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,549
This is not good.

318
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,760
It's all my fault.

319
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,762
Because of me, Ms. Maiko was taken.

320
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,229
Damn!

321
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,767
Wait for me.

322
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,530
I'll come rescue you!

323
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,539
Ryo, hurry up!

324
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,631
Stuff happens...

325
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,014
Is he...

326
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,601
Are you sure City Hunter is coming?

327
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,728
I'm positive!

328
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,174
Tetsu! Don't scare me like that!

329
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,641
Mr. Tetsu!

330
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,646
Mr. Gonzo, please let that girl go.

331
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,815
What are you talking about, sleepy head?!

332
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,051
This girl is the trap for bringing him to us.

333
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,820
Please, please let her go.

334
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,887
Idiot!

335
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,980
Shut up, you're just a disposal bullet!

336
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,991
Disposal bullet?

337
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,992
Me?

338
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,127
Exactly.

339
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,895
You're just a messenger.

340
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,230
There are many others who can do your part.

341
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,932
You are expendable.

342
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,500
That's cruel.

343
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,769
My ideal yakuza world shouldn't be like that.

344
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,535
I can't believe I have sacrificed my
youth for a filthy world like this.

345
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,841
Idiot.

346
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,442
This ain't a movie.

347
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,910
No one would be able to survive
in a world like this

348
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,378
by believing in such beautiful relationships.

349
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,845
You're so naive.

350
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,579
Tetsu, this is such a short term
to be brothers, isn't it?

351
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,587
Sir...

352
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,713
No!

353
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,281
You bitch!

354
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,094
Mr. Tetsu!

355
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,584
Good, you're okay.

356
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,022
Blood...

357
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,224
Mr. Tetsu, pull yourself together!

358
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,739
Tetsu, I'll make you be at peace
once and for all.

359
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,899
No!

360
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,209
Who the hell are you?

361
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,680
Don't touch those two.

362
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,549
City Hunter!

363
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,784
You're the ringleader, aren't you?

364
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,776
You just want to be happy and not do
the dirty work, do you?

365
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,978
Shut up! Die!

366
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:32,096
Do you know what the last days of jerks
like you are like, who try to kill me?

367
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,206
Please forgive me.

368
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:38,110
I'll go back to my hometown so
please don't kill me. Please!

369
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,212
I'll let you go this once, just this time.

370
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,213
Hurry up and disappear.

371
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,771
Yes, yes, Sir! I am so sorry.

372
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,885
Mr. Tetsu, please don't die.

373
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,451
He won't survive if he doesn't have surgery.

374
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,928
No, it's just a little wound.

375
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,029
I'm going to call an ambulance.

376
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,462
No, you don't need to.

377
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,432
You're bleeding so bad.

378
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,922
You'll die from blood loss!

379
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,270
I did whatever I wanted to do
in my yakuza life.

380
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,439
I have no regrets in my life
if I die right now like this.

381
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,209
Idiot! If you die, your life will
have been worthless.

382
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,443
No!

383
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,111
I'll go anywhere but the hospital!

384
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,102
I've hated hospitals since I was a kid.

385
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,148
Mr. Tetsu...

386
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,351
Don't worry.

387
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,719
Nothing to be scared of.

388
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,486
I have an idea.

389
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,479
Mr. Tetsu, I'm going to have surgery,
so are you. Please, Mr. Tetsu.

390
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,886
Maiko, you...

391
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,191
Right? Mr. Tetsu, please.
I don't want you to die.

392
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,429
I understand. I will go to the hospital.

393
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,601
Mr. Tetsu...

394
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,311
I'm not scared.

395
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,778
It will be over soon.

396
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,844
Maiko, you are a good and gentle girl.

397
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,226
Don't worry.

398
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,626
Actually, his wound is not that bad.

399
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,265
I wonder if I didn't exaggerate his condition?

400
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,833
Really?

401
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,834
Yes...

402
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,301
He will be fine soon.

403
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,072
In Operation

404
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,415
I'm glad that Maiko's surgery was successful.

405
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,522
Mr. Saeba! Ms. Kaori!

406
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,356
Hello!

407
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,391
You look fine.

408
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,158
Here, a present for you.

409
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,284
Thank you.

410
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:35,894
Oh, I have to ask you this.

411
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,298
Maiko, I've heard that Mr. Tetsu is studying
to become a registered nurse.

412
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,699
Yes, he is.

413
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,759
He says he will devote his life to helping
other people, and he is full of energy.

414
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,071
Super Express Train!
There's Mr. Tetsu.

415
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,629
It's gonna be so fast!

416
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,344
When he has time, he comes here to
volunteer to take care of the kids.

417
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,107
He's very popular among the kids here.

418
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,581
People have their own suitable way of living.

419
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,817
He's a good guy and suitable for this
world, not the underworld.

420
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,978
Kids are all over him.

421
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,123
By the way Ryo, what happened to
your "raising fish" mission?

422
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,291
I forgot about it...

423
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,452
Damn, I shouldn't have mentioned it to him.

424
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,763
Hey, Maiko, I'll take you for a ride on
the Ultra Super Express.

425
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,664
Really?

426
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,926
Here we go!

427
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,302
Two years will be very soon at this speed!

428
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,566
Ryo, are you serious?!

429
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:33,383
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

430
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,856
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

431
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,587
You skip dinner and eat diet food

432
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:48,726
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

433
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:53,138
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

434
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,471
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

435
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:03,576
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

436
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:12,654
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

437
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,559
Don't you, don't you know

438
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,932
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

439
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:28,771
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

440
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:34,671
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

441
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,919
Kaori, why are you here?

442
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,088
My money was stolen in a bank robbery.

443
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,489
I'm too frustrated!

444
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,159
You chased them all the way? What a pain!

445
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,293
Same to you, Ryo.

446
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,227
This is inside of the ship.

447
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,228
Following Saeko.

448
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,062
Shame on you.

449
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,464
You were tricked and dumped, weren't you?

450
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,900
I'm sure that the person Saeko is
flattering is the suspect.

451
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,734
Really?!

452
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,370
Hey, thief! Give my 100,000 yen back to me!

453
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,538
City Hunter 2:

454
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,340
"Ryo, Please Be Deceived
Present to a Girl From Saeko"

455
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,137
If you miss it, I'm going to trick you.

456
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,268
Please look forward to the next episode
