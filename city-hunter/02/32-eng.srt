Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:25,481
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

3
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,795
Mayonaka no lady, hitogomi ni magire

00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:41,399
Utsurigi na steppin' kurikaeshite iru

Odori akashite mo

00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,686
Sono hitomi wa kodoku na iro

Oh, Sarah, akirame nai de,

Oh, Sarah, sono omoi o, wasurezu ni ite

00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:19,679
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:29,645
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,353
Kaori, this is my best friend Robert Harrison.

14
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,301
I'm going to act as bodyguard for
Princess Angela with him.

15
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,303
What? He called me charming?

16
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,105
Indeed, he is the best sweeper in the US.

17
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,039
His eyesight is super!

18
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,508
Well, his eyesight is getting worse,
but he has incredible skill.

19
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,542
What the hell?

20
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,780
Anyway, who is behind the assassination
team trying to kill Princess Angela?

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,247
General Marukido.

22
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,851
He plans to take control of
the Felidan Kingdom

23
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,487
and set a bomb at the villa where the
peace talks will be held soon.

24
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,751
Oh, my God! Ryo, Hurry up!

25
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:07,882
So Long, My Friend
The Last Shot Echoing in My Heart
(Part 2)

26
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:10,554
Wait!

27
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,032
We have time.

28
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,024
It would be better to wait to go into the
villa until everybody gets here.

29
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,604
Are you saying there is some trap in there?

30
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,408
There's no guarantee that there
are no betrayers.

31
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,273
Being too careful can't hurt.

32
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,511
Yes!

33
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,680
What's the matter?

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,015
Why don't they go in?!

35
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,884
They're seeing how things will turn out.

36
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,685
Do you think they're suspicious
about the villa?

37
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,947
Maybe.

38
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,216
Damn...

39
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,920
No, as we thought, the line
is not connecting.

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,332
I'm sure the line has been cut.

41
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,367
Let's go, Kaori!

42
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:47,992
Sure!

43
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,979
Oh, no, we won't be able to
make it if this keeps up!

44
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,776
Hold on, Kaori.

45
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:15,920
This is bad!

46
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,154
I'm going to get sick!

47
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,669
Truck!

48
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,703
Oh, no, we can't go through.

49
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,670
Stop!

50
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,833
The other group is here, I guess.

51
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,200
Well, the explosion will be at
11 o'clock as we planned.

52
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,582
You must be the representatives of the
People's Liberation Organization.

53
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,784
I'm the representative, Gauss.

54
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,953
These two are Moran and Gali.

55
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,215
By the way, who is he?

56
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:20,360
This is my bodyguard, Mr. Robert Harrison.

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,421
I can't send the princess alone
into a cage of wolves.

58
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,393
I guess he doesn't like us.

59
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,934
Somebody has been trying to
kill her since yesterday.

60
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,409
They were your friends, weren't they?

61
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,777
What the hell?

62
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,846
We've never tried to kill the princess.

63
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,748
If you're making up your own side
of the story, I won't forget it.

64
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,882
Cut it out, Moran.

65
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,579
We came here for peace talks, not to argue.

66
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,423
Mr. Robert, you should stay out.

67
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,858
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:58,263
However, if something happens to the
princess, I won't let you out alive!

69
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,933
Same to you.

70
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,435
If we don't return from here,

71
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:07,040
our companions will attack the
government in our country.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,406
We don't want that to happen, do we?

73
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,544
We can't stand up here and talk for long.

74
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,912
Why don't we go inside the villa?

75
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:13,980
Not yet.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,581
There are some members missing.

77
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,176
General Marukido is not here yet.

78
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,652
Unless all the members are here,
we can't trust each other, can we?

79
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,850
Of course not.

80
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,399
I'm sorry for being late.

81
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,034
The traffic was bad.

82
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,901
Let's go inside and start the peace talks.

83
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,906
It's 10:25.

84
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,277
The explosion is exactly at 11 AM.
Understand?

85
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,335
Yes, Sir!

86
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:14,396
I guess these peace talks will be
useful, Princess Angela.

87
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,509
I'm glad.

88
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,876
It's worth it for me to have come all the
way to Japan to have these talks.

89
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,416
We still haven't finished the details,

90
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,018
but we've both agreed in principle to
the peace accord, haven't we?

91
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:30,890
Well, I guess my part is over.

92
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,520
I'm going to relax in the room upstairs
for a while now.

93
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,002
Excuse me, but I would like to
make a phone call

94
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,771
to the consulate general to report
how things are going now.

95
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,238
Sure.

96
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,546
Mr. Mosada, it's about 11 o'clock now.

97
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,584
The villa! We finally got here!

98
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,489
What is that noise?

99
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,928
Run! A bomb has been set in here.

100
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,031
What?!

101
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,498
Mr. Gauss, hurry up!

102
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,103
Princess Angela, you too!

103
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,038
Mr. Robert is upstairs having a rest.

104
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,206
What?

105
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,936
Anyway, Kaori, take Princess Angela outside!

106
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,404
Robert! Wake up!

107
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,345
Robert, where are you?

108
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,948
Marukido!

109
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,810
Go!

110
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:35,954
Robert!

111
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,754
Robert!

112
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,061
Ryo...

113
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,077
No way...

114
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,544
Ryo...

115
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,683
Ryo!

116
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,353
Ryo...

117
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,231
Ryo! I'm glad you are safe.

118
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,365
Where is Robert?

119
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,832
He's also safe, isn't he?

120
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,830
He... Robert didn't make it.

121
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,801
Oh, no, no way!

122
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,978
Damn!

123
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,818
Because of that strange bodyguard,
I failed again!

124
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,119
Don't worry.

125
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,655
We'll accomplish the request
no matter what happens.

126
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,756
No, it's okay now.

127
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,247
Since things turned out like this,
please withdraw from here.

128
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,495
What do you mean by that, General?

129
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,190
Do you mean you can't trust us?

130
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,600
Oh, no, I didn't mean that.

131
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,435
If we withdraw from here
without doing anything,

132
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,238
we'll become the laughingstock of
everybody in our business.

133
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,638
We will kill Princess Angela, we promise.

134
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,309
I understand.

135
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,410
Do whatever you want to.

136
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,378
Anyway, I'm going to go.

137
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,509
Just as I thought, General Marukido
is the ringleader of everything.

138
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,657
Princess Angela, don't worry too much.

139
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:22,720
After we get back to our country, we will help
you to clean up corruption like Marukido's.

140
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,989
Watch out!

141
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,731
Mr. Gauss!

142
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,369
Are you all right?

143
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,637
Don't worry.

144
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,372
It's just a scratch, the same as Molan.

145
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,170
Kaori, please take care of their wounds.

146
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,411
Ryo, where are you going?

147
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,078
Cover him!

148
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,204
Yes, Sir!

149
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,928
That noise...

150
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,100
You, jerk!

151
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,144
Where is General Marukido?

152
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,181
That wimp ran away a long time ago.

153
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,192
Wait!

154
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,897
Who are you?

155
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,389
I still can't believe you finished us
just like killing a little baby.

156
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,037
Ryo Saeba...

157
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,666
You can call me City Hunter.

158
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,013
I see.

159
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,641
He is the City Hunter.

160
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,275
I have something to talk about
after I get to Hell.

161
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,502
You saved us.

162
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,969
Let me thank you.

163
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,062
This is my business.

164
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,665
Mr. Saeba!

165
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,112
You are going to chase
General Marukido, aren't you?

166
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,340
Let me go with you!

167
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,290
Ryo, leave Princess Angela here.

168
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,257
It's dangerous!

169
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,702
For you, Mr. Saeba, Robert
was a good partner.

170
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,967
Well, he was more than that, wasn't he?

171
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,173
He...

172
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,177
I owe him.

173
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,974
It happened five years ago.

174
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:01,751
I discovered the stolen plutonium and
the criminal group was chasing me.

175
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,296
I had used all my bullets and there was
nothing I could do except run from them.

176
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,801
There are two things which a man has to do.

177
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:57,610
To love girls and to pay back his friends.

178
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,374
And I couldn't pay him back.

179
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,747
There's just one thing I can do now...
one thing.

180
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,019
I will kill Marukido by myself
and send him to Hell.

181
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,425
Mr. Saeba...

182
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,234
General, there's a car following us.

183
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,030
What?

184
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,794
Princess Angela and that bodyguard?!

185
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,006
Mosada failed again!

186
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,302
Damn, speed up and escape.

187
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,284
What are you doing? Push that
tiny car off the cliff!

188
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,839
We did it! We did it!

189
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,491
General, that's them! They should
have fallen off the cliff!

190
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,458
What? No way!

191
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:09,937
Damn!

192
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,281
Please help me!

193
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,215
Please don't shoot me!

194
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,150
I'll give Marukido to you!

195
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,418
Wait!

196
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,784
You should have been shot to death
escaping under enemy fire.

197
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,424
Your misbegotten fate is over now.

198
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,918
Since I'm kind, I'll kill you with just
one bullet and send you to Hell.

199
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,064
Wait, don't be hasty.

200
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,098
What do you want?

201
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,067
If you help me, I'll give you as
much money as you want.

202
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,038
What I want is your life.

203
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,997
That's the only payback I can give poor Robert.

204
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,345
Poor Robert?

205
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,812
Pay back?

206
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,950
I see.

207
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,584
I understand now.

208
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,747
You want to kill me because you
want to pay back Robert.


209
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,757
What a good story!

210
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,190
It makes me happy!

211
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,758
What's so funny?

212
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,252
Yes, it's funny.

213
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:09,197
That's because Robert is alive.

214
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,763
What?!

215
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,704
Princess!

216
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,186
No way... It's so ridiculous.

217
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,256
Die!

218
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:41,800
Ryo!

219
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,768
Oh, no, Princess Angela!

220
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,132
Kaori, I'm going to leave the princess to you.

221
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,143
Hey, what's the matter, Ryo?

222
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,610
Where are you going?

223
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,441
Come out!

224
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,846
I know it's you hidden somewhere.

225
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,813
Robert!

226
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,954
You discovered it as I expected.

227
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,423
Why? Why did you betray me?

228
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,997
I didn't betray you.

229
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,165
First of all,

230
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,468
I came to Japan because I accepted a
contract to assassinate the princess

231
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,403
in case the attempt to blow up the villa failed.

232
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:57,643
I was free until I took the princess to the villa.


233
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:01,477
I agreed to be her bodyguard until then.

234
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,884
But Marukido expected me to be on his side.

235
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,852
Anyway, you should understand since
you're also a professional.

236
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,577
No, I don't understand.

237
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,459
You're such a spoiled baby.

238
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,962
You can't live in this world if you
become too emotional.

239
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,530
This is the iron rule.

240
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,566
This time, I'll let you go.

241
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,533
Go away now.

242
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,035
Okay.

243
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,502
I guess you hate me.

244
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,493
No way!

245
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,639
Princess Angela!

246
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,376
I see.

247
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,745
A bullet-proof vest...

248
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,647
Even though she'll have some fractures,
she's still okay, I guess.

249
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,654
I don't think I can go away now
without doing something.

250
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,524
No, I don't want to fight against you.

251
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,694
Marukido is dead and the
contract is useless now.

252
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,595
It's not true.

253
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,359
Even though Marukido has died,
the contract itself is still alive.

254
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,634
Oh, no.

255
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,237
Mr. Robert and Ryo have to fight.

256
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,704
I have to stop them!

257
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,306
I've been expecting that someday
we would fight like this.

258
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,019
Listen, Ryo.

259
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,783
When this scope touches the surface
of the water, that's it.

260
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,425
Ryo, please be safe, both of you.

261
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,586
I think Ryo can do it.

262
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,429
No...

263
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,624
If their skill is even, one of them will die.

264
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,365
Ryo!

265
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,012
Robert!

266
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:20,147
The gun was lighter since I removed
the scope, so my aim was off.

267
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,286
Don't talk!

268
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,923
Too late.

269
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,259
I can't be saved.

270
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,228
Take care of Kaori, okay?

271
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,395
I'll be waiting for you in Hell.

272
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,436
Robert!

273
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,029
Thank you for everything.

274
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,463
I am glad that the peace talks
were such a success.

275
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:11,425
Mr. Saeba didn't come today, did he?

276
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,038
I'm sorry.

277
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,506
He told me that he really wants
to be alone today.

278
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,810
By the way, how is your wound?

279
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,335
Yes, it's not a big problem now.

280
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,681
My wound can be healed with
the passage of time.

281
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:40,326
However, Mr. Saeba's heart was injured
so badly it will never be able to heal.

282
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:33,383
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

283
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,856
Marude juni dake kisou Faye Dunaway

284
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,587
Yuushoku mo tabezu ni, diet food

285

Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

Kimi wa kangeki mo sezu morau dake de

287
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,471
Mansion no temae de, say goodbye

288
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:03,576
Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no
otoko to iu mono o

289
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:12,654
Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa

290
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,559
Don't you, don't you know

291
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,932
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

292
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:28,771
Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,
ju-yon-kai mo shogezu ni

293
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:34,671
Hontou no dance, chance,
romance wa jibun shidai da ze


294
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,153
It's easy to find a missing person, isn't it?


295
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,554
Why don't you hurry up and
bring them back?

296
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,222
What part do you think is easy?

297
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,591
Sakura is the queen of the Pirates.

298
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,692
A street gang?

299
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,362
I'm going to be chased by hundreds
of armed gang members.

300
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,098
Since they have weapons, I wonder if there
is some organization behind the gang?

301
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,933
I have to put up with all kinds of trouble.

302
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,435
Even Umibozu is interrupting me.

303
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,003
Oh, no, why does he do so?

304
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,171
City Hunter 2:

305
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:03,208
"Mokkori Contract! The Strange Journey
of Ryo & a Bad Girl (Part 1)"

306
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,607
If you miss it, I'm going to become a bad girl.

307
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:08,611
Please look forward to the next episode
