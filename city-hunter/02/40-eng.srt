00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Mayonaka no lady, hitogomi ni magire

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
Utsurigi na steppin' kurikaeshite iru

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Tsuyogari no face, tough na furi de

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Odori akashite mo

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
Sono hitomi wa kodoku na iro

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
Kakushi kire nai

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, akirame nai de,

Oh, Sarah, sono omoi o, wasurezu ni ite

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,130
What?

14
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,700
Miki is pressuring Umibozu to get married?

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,869
If Ryo is hit by a paint bullet from Miki,


16
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,405
Umibozu has to marry her.

17
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,040
Ryo, get hit!

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,974
No way!

19
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,844
I'll run away until the end.
I'll win a mokkori with Miki!

20
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,012
Those two are falling in love with each other.

21
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,280
Don't you get it?

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,984
But Umibozu has been running away from
Miki for a long time, hasn't he?

23
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,386
There must be some story behind Umibozu.

24
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,021
But I still don't understand why
a beautiful woman like Miki

25
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,823
loves a stupid octopus like him!

26
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,484
Only I can get a woman like her.

27
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,193
I'm so sorry!

28
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:12,287
Umi-chan, What a Sexy Guy!
Beautiful Sweeper Miki Gets Close
(Part 2)

29
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,939
Shoot! How persistent!

30
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,077
Don't stop at a place like this and say,
"Ippatsu, ippatsu," for an hour.

31
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,146
Go somewhere else.

32
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,215
No, I won't move until you say yes.

33
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,817
You have only two more days.

34
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,352
The result of the bet is obvious.

35
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,880
To have mokkori two days from now, or
do it today, it's the same. Ippatsu!

36
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,029
He knows that I won't leave him.

37
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:43,663
Wait!

38
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,597
Yes!

39
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,064
Wait!

40
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,834
You!

41
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,202
Such a pervert!

42
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,169
Yes, Ma'am.

43
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,206
Oh, what's the matter?

44
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,572
Come here, I'm going to run into this place.

45
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,243
Now, I don't care anymore.

46
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,513
Oops, she's gone.

47
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,710
Well, in that case, I'm going to find
somebody else around here.

48
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,854
Excuse me, but won't you have
some coffee with me?

49
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,822
Let's go, let's go, let's go to a hotel.

50
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,289
Oh, boy! He is acting so like himself.

51
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,318
That Mokkori Man, I'm going to
get him this time!

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,497
He's gone?

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,768
No, no.

54
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,305
I can tell where you are one minute
before you shoot.

55
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,673
How?

56
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,939
Even if you hide, your presence is so strong,
I know where you are immediately.

57
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,011
Presence?

58
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,483
I see, my presence.

59
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,058
If I eliminate it, I might be able to shoot him.

60
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,550
But I wonder if it can be eliminated so easily?

61
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,600
Self-hypnosis.

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,301
Yes, that's it.

63
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,837
I'll hypnotize myself, and when Saeba
speaks some key word,

64
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,204
I'll shoot him without realizing it.

65
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,444
The key word is the point.

66
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,607
A word he says pretty often...

67
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,820
Yes!

68
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,591
Anyway, how long does she need
to be in the bathroom?

69
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,058
What's she doing?

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,424
Well, I guess she's planning
something anyway.

71
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,002
The key word is ippatsu.

72
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,267
I'll count to three then forget
about this hypnosis.

73
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,439
Okay?

74
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,208
One, two, three!

75
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,690
Oh, how cute!

76
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,285
Really, young mothers are so cute.

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,900
Listen, I was saying the baby was cute!

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,068
I don't like babies.

79
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,535
They're not in my field of vision.

80
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,372
Just as I thought.

81
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,680
Even if your techniques are equal, Falcon
is a lot better than you personally.

82
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,847
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,816
My facial features are a lot more
human-looking than Umibozu.

84
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,681
I'm not talking about features.

85
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,382
For example, well...

86
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,823
If you meet a girl, about eight years old,


87
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:28,283
no family, no relatives, on her own in a
foreign country, what would you do?

88
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,263
About eight years old?

89
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,765
I would look forward to seeing her
again in ten years.

90
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,900
Well, I guess you would,

91
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,061
but Falcon is different.

92
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,199
He wouldn't leave a girl there.

93
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,706
He wouldn't...

94
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,244
I see.

95
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,838
The girl is you.

96
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,718
If I knew that girl would grow up and
become a beautiful woman like you,

97
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,916
I would take care of her and wait for her
to become an adult and ippatsu!

98
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,534
Oh, did I do something?

99
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,470
It was close.

100
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,506
It was seriously close!

101
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,996
Nozomi!

102
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,741
Oh, God!

103
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,947
Oh, no, I can't get her with these shoes!

104
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,218
Saeba!

105
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,129
Get out of my way!

106
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,858
You wanna get hit and killed?!

107
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,533
Damn, such idiots!

108
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,397
What the hell?! I can't see!

109
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,358
Is the baby all right?

110
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,592
Yes...

111
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,857
Sorry to make you waste ippatsu.

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,535
Oh, what?

113
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,669
What's wrong with me?

114
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,296
Saeba?!

115
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,176
Anyway, that is what happened.

116
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,574
It's a miracle that Miki has
been safe until today.

117
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,555
But both of them are in bed together now.

118
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,760
Is it true?!

119
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,227
Lie.

120
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,756
As I thought, you love her.

121
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,437
But time is critical.

122
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,972
The deadline is today.

123
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,735
I don't think she's going to win.

124
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,344
Wait a second.

125
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,780
Don't you care if things really
happen like that?

126
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,381
It's not too late.

127
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,916
Please stop this bet.

128
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,215
Both of you love each other so why
don't you get married?

129
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,784
My mind is not sharp enough to protect
loved ones in the world I live in.

130
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,221
Not like Ryo.

131
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,835
Protect loved ones...

132
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,462
Like Ryo?

133
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:26,868
What?

134
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,012
That bastard!

135
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,810
He has a mistress behind my back?

136
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,312
You missed. That was the last one.

137
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,597
Miki!

138
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,732
Yes, Ma'am!

139
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,467
Come with me.

140
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,128
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,327
Hey, Kaori, she didn't do it on purpose.

142
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,170
What the hell was that power?

143
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,917
What? Are you sure?

144
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,578
I can't stay away from this matter any more.

145
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,788
No matter what happens, I'll help you win.

146
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,846
Trust me!

147
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,894
Miki, you're so quiet.

148
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,629
What's going on?

149
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,395
Mokkori, mokkori, just like a gecko.

150
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,629
It's strange. I can't find her anywhere.

151
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:42,813
I took Kaori hostage.
If you want me to return her,
come to Land Reclamation Block B
at 6:00 PM without any weapons.
Miki

152
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,543
Took Kaori hostage?

153
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,356
We should stop this, Kaori.

154
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,789
Why?

155
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,217
It's not fair to use Saeba's love for you.

156
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,731
Love?

157
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,234
Yes, I can tell that both of you
love each other.

158
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,036
Not at all!

159
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,561
He has a mistress.

160
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,343
We're just partners.

161
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,144
Our relationship is not what you think.

162
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:16,376
But he can't do anything without me,
so I know he'll come to rescue me.

163
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,977
If he doesn't show up, I can't
be his partner any...

164
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,322
Saeba...

165
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,657
I wonder where he's going?

166
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,259
It's too early to get there on time.

167
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,659
Anyway, let's follow him.

168
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,071
Who is it?!

169
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,043
Something wrong?

170
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,840
You were daydreaming, weren't you?

171
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,545
Ryo!

172
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,584
Why are you here?

173
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,051
What do you want?

174
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,053
Look at this.

175
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,525
What? Miki did this?

176
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,016
See? I told you, things like this happen.

177
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,730
If you have someone important
to you staying close to you,

178
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,432
things like this will happen.

179
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,766
That's why I...

180
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,758
I see, someone important. You mean Miki?

181
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,541
You finally confessed.

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,009
What's so funny?!

183
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,411
Your partner is in danger, isn't she?

184
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,878
Don't worry about it.

185
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,083
This was all planned by Kaori. Look!

186
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,350
Do you think this is Miki's handwriting?

187
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,553
This is such child's play.

188
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,454
What?

189
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,555
Damn...

190
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,216
He suspected it, just as I thought.

191
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,726
But isn't it cute?

192
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,387
Miki is pretty much desperate.

193
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,763
Actually, it's dangerous for
a person like you or me

194
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,129
to keep our important people close to us.

195
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,796
But that's not the only reason, is it?

196
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,904
You, when did you take it?!

197
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,429
Wow, how cute Miki was!

198
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,904
I would like to hear the whole story
about this picture.

199
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,048
I know you have something hidden.

200
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,345
Tell me.

201
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,990
I'm surprised.

202
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,458
This place is Umibozu's hideout.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,061
That country was constantly embroiled
in a civil war. It never ended.

204
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,942
A girl whose parents were dead and
who had no relatives or anything...

205
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,409
That was Miki.

206
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,248
The only thing I could do to help her
survive on her own

207
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,716
was to pass my mercenary knowledge to her.

208
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,185
That's what I thought then.

209
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,685
I taught her all of my techniques
so she could protect herself.

210
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,387
Everything from how to use guns, to knives.

211
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:21,956
Someday, when I left that place,
Miki would be alone.

212
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,636
At that time, I was sure that such
knowledge would be useful to her.

213
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,903
However, I was wrong.

214
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:37,011
When she turned fourteen, I thought
she would be all right on her own.

215
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:42,547
She told me that she would join
my troop as a mercenary.

216
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,519
Then I finally realized.

217
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,728
What I had been doing for her, what I
thought would be useful to her,

218
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,731
was to raise an innocent girl who
didn't have any experience in love

219
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,528
to become a mercenary.

220
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,572
But it was because she yearns for you.

221
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,940
Shut up.

222
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,541
No matter what the reason was,

223
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:07,580
the result was that I took away her
opportunity to fall in love and her youth,

224
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,140
and sent her to the bloody battlefield.

225
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,917
That's why...

226
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,350
That's why...

227
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,786
You did Falcon, you...

228
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,262
Are you sure, Falcon?

229
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,991
Are you really going to quit
being a mercenary?

230
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,424
I see. Then you're going to take me
with you, aren't you?

231
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,774
You'll marry me, won't you?

232
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,107
I will be with you forever!

233
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,027
I understand.

234
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,758
That's why you made me quit
being a mercenary.

235
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,337
And then you disappeared.

236
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,068
That's about it.

237
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:16,904
I knew that she wouldn't quit being
a mercenary until I quit.

238
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,084
I see.

239
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,578
Now, she's finally re-starting her ordinary life.

240
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,860
And if she loves a person like you, she'll be
coming back to a bloody world again.

241
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,764
You understand me, Ryo.

242
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,464
Good!

243
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,491
I'll win the bet and give her enough
happiness as a woman!

244
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,237
Bastard!

245
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,373
You don't understand me at all!

246
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,077
You belong to the same place as I do.

247
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,513
You can't make her happy!

248
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,310
Ryo, give up on Miki!

249
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,711
Nobody knows about it until
someone tries, I think.

250
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:59,658
I promised myself that I would
cut off all the evil hands

251
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,684
that might pull Miki into a world like this.

252
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,166
This is a good opportunity, Ryo.

253
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,135
I've been thinking that we would have to
settle our relationship someday.

254
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,873
A duel?

255
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,341
What a stone head you have, just as always.

256
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,781
Good...

257
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,646
But I don't have any weapons today.

258
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,320
And you call yourself a pro?

259
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,823
You were fooling around without
carrying any weapons?

260
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,727
But this note says come
without any weapons.

261
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,786
I came here on my way to the place.

262
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,732
Wait there.

263
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,063
Sure!

264
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:59,579
Miki, I'll never, ever take your
happiness away from you.

265
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,156
Use that one.

266
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,714
I'm going to use the same type of gun.

267
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,524
We have one bullet each.

268
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,498
Okay, good gun.

269
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,033
But...

270
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,801
I'd rather use that one than this one.

271
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,835
What?

272
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,872
There might be some trick in this one.

273
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,474
I'm sorry I'm so skeptical, but
I just want to make sure.

274
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,304
All right?

275
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,972
Whatever!

276
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,580
This can't be happening.

277
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,047
Those two can't do this.

278
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,084
Anytime, Ryo.

279
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,052
Draw!

280
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,354
Are you sure?

281
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,755
If you let me draw first, you won't be
able to regret it in this world.

282
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,985
Oh, I've never seen Ryo being so serious.

283
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,957
They are serious. Their fighting
signals can't be faked.

284
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,759
Their skills are equal.

285
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,004
If those two fight each other,
both of them will be hurt.

286
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,439
The one who is abandoned by the
Goddess of Victory will die.

287
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,481
Or...

288
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,518
Both of them...

289
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,985
will die!

290
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,855
No!

291
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,428
No! Too late!

292
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,706
My best outfit is ruined!

293
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,333
What the hell is this?!

294
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,476
This is ink from the paint bullets?!

295
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,644
Ryo!

296
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,111
Falcon!

297
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,505
Miki, why are you here?!

298
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,278
Oh, I see. You did this, Miki, didn't you?

299
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,889
You expected that we would duel

300
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,756
and you changed the bullets for
the paint ones, I see.

301
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:25,898
You couldn't do it yourself so you let
Umibozu get paint all over me.

302
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,195
What?

303
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,735
Ryo, you knew we were following you
and did this on purpose, didn't...

304
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,707
Is it so, Miki?

305
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,842
Well...

306
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,645
Yes, that's right.

307
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,510
How was our plan?

308
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,575
We succeeded perfectly.

309
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,815
I guess we lost the bet, Umibozu.

310
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,991
No way! You did this.

311
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,050
You pretended to check the gun and then...

312
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,769
I know you did it.

313
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,971
Hey, you, poor loser.

314
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,340
Hurry up and marry Miki.

315
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,479
Falcon, you didn't take my
happiness away from me.

316
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,615
It's the total opposite!

317
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:22,076
You gave me a larger happiness.
Love, youth, you gave them all to me.

318
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:27,851
Falcon, all these mean you are with me.


319
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:35,928
If there was a time when you
took my happiness away,

320
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,799
it was the time you disappeared.

321
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,671
Damn! I thought you might disappear
again and go away from me!

322
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,275
You, idiot!

323
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,180
Miki...

324
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,124
It's over.

325
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:04,096
The man who duelled with me for Miki
should be able to protect her.

326
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,462
Beauty and Beast, case closed.

327
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,660
No, it's not over.

328
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,603
There's your mistress.

329
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,771
Mistress?

330
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,762
What the hell are you talking about?

331
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,676
Don't try to fool me.

332
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,444
I've heard about her from Umibozu.

333
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,002
You, idiot, pervert!

334
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,781
Oh, wait, Kaori.

335
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,146
You misunderstood me!

336
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,610
Wait!

337
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,078
Miki, I live next to death all the time.


338
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,692
You want to come into a world like that...

339
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,529
You're such a stupid woman.

340
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,996
I don't care what happens.

341
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,601
Falcon, you mean...

342
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,835
I have no other choice.

343
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,504
I lost the bet.

344
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,995
It wasn't fair, but well...

345
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,411
I can't really marry you,

346
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,209
but you can stay with me as my partner.

347
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,083
Falcon...

348
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,032
Hey, wait! Confess! You, pervert!

349
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:14,599
Hey, wait! Confess! You, pervert!
Guitar o kikase ta katta

350
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,002
It's a false accusation!
Hey, wait! Confess! You, pervert!
Guitar o kikase ta katta

351
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:17,669
It's a false accusation!
Guitar o kikase ta katta

352
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,136
Guitar o kikase ta katta

353
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,833
Ai o todoke ta katta

354
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:27,735
Omoi ga tsutae rare na katta

355
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:38,254
Boku ga sumu kono machi o,
kimi wa nani mo shiranai

356
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,651
Boku ga koko ni iru wake sae mo

00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,790
You don't have time to talk about that.

00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,664
I like her better than a kid.

00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,733
You can't be thinking something
perverted in front of Sara.

00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,567
Why not?

372
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,402
She can read people's minds.

373
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,270
