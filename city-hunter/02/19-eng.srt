1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:39,132
Kaori, can you read this?

13
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,360
It says X, Y, Z.

14
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,070
Good, good job for a young woman. Exactly.

15
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,901
You understand what I want
to say, don't you?

16
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,431
Yes, yes, I know.

17
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:53,046
The client must be a man, and the
person who wrote letters like this

18
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,105
must be an old man, so you
won't take this job.

19
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,249
Exactly!

20
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:03,318
I guess you've finally become
an adult as my partner.

21
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,492
Then, your mission is...

22
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,356
Sure, I know.

23
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,331
You want me to tell the client that we
won't take the job, don't you?

24
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,821
Yes, that's right.

25
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,528
You're too gentle, aren't you?

26
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,205
The job offer's from an old man,

27
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,470
so he wants a bodyguard for his
granddaughter, I'd guess.

28
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,613
Kaori, what did you just say?

29
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,774
Granddaughter?

30
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,918
Nothing. Well, I'd better be on my way
to turn down this offer.

31
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:36,589
Wait, Kaori. It's against my policy to turn
down a request without hearing the details.

32
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,456
On top of that, the client is an
old man who won't live long.

33
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,163
It's our responsibility as young people
to look after the elderly.

34
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,462
If we don't do it, who will?

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Kaori Takes a Great Active Role!
Cheers With the Memorial Wine

36
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,983
The client is a grandfather, and we're
guarding his granddaughter.

37
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,314
I'm so happy.

38
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,456
If he doesn't have a granddaughter,
what shall I do?

39
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,014
Ryo may kill me.

40
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,019
Katano
Fruit Parlor

41
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,923
Is this the place we're supposed to meet?

42
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:27,066
Well, from the front of Katano Fruit Parlor,
six steps towards the street.

43
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,711
From there, five steps to the left.

44
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:39,874
Facing the Parlor, at exactly 4 o'clock,
I will be there.

45
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,622
The meeting place is...

46
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,798
How lucky I am!

47
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,766
Here, this spot is the best seat.

48
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,463
Hey, young man, you're dirty, aren't you?

49
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,468
You too, old man.

50
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,725
No way!

51
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,595
Oh, incredible!

52
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,365
What? No!

53
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,794
No! No!

54
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,271
It's so cute when she's shy like that!

55
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,841
Ryo, you knew this was going to happen!

56
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,276
No, I didn't know anything!

57
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,504
But I knew.

58
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,381
Damn, this is the wrong one.

59
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,815
Grandpa, pull yourself together! Grandpa!

60
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,485
I'm so sorry.

61
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,613
Ryo! Oh, no, what shall I do?

62
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,056
Guard is off!

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,524
Stay there, you pervert!

64
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,666
Wait a second, can you see this?

65
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,400
Ecks
Whai
Zed
Ryonosuke
Wait a second, can you see this?

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,264
Ecks
Whai
Zed
Ryonosuke

67
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,940
Well, are you a client, Grandpa?

68
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,981
I like you because you're very active.
My name is Ryonosuke.

69
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,448
Please do a good job for me.

70
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,884
I saw a chick on your panties.

71
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,564
A modern girl wearing such cute panties.
It was good for my eyes.

72
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,100
Hurry up and tell me what you want us to do!

73
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,601
Bodyguard.

74
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,331
Yes, that's it. Is your granddaughter cute?
Do you have a picture?

75
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,100
Granddaughter? What are you talking about?

76
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,374
I don't have any relatives, so I don't
have a granddaughter.

77
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,313
Then who do you need a bodyguard for?

78
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,715
Grandpa, you?

79
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,050
Of course, who else would it be?

80
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,984
Pass.

81
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,078
Wait, Ryo. You shouldn't do so
at a time like this.

82
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,358
No kidding. I came here because you
told me about a granddaughter.

83
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,451
You interpreted it that way, didn't you?

84
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:05,696
Well, as I thought, an old man like me
is abandoned by society.

85
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,600
I won't live long because I'm old.

86
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,606
Even if I die, nobody will feel sorry for me.

87
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,071
Ryo!

88
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,445
I guess I have to accept it.

89
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:24,784
My wife passed away and an old man
like me is going to die alone

90
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,446
in a small nook of the big city.

91
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,490
Excuse me, old man.

92
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,992
I am not saying I don't like this job
because you're old.

93
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,688
I have my own job policies to adhere to.

94
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:45,369
How nice she is, a blonde beauty
wearing a mini skirt!

95
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,002
Those two are very similar.

96
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,708
No way! Are you saying I look
like this pervert?!

97
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,113
I don't want to be guarded by
a man like this!

98
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,638
Good! I don't want to guard you either!

99
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,454
Ms. Kaori, I want you to protect me.

100
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,388
Me? No, no!

101
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:10,319
What shall I do if you abandon me,
Ms. Kaori? What shall I do?

102
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:15,063
Okay, I'll do it, so please don't cry.
Right, Ryo?

103
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,869
Kaori, this is a good chance for you
to become independent.

104
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,708
People say that lions throw their
cubs into a deep valley

105
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,677
and only raise the ones who can make it out.

106
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,179
I'll do the same with you. Do your best.

107
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,280
Hey Ryo!

108
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,015
I know you're just trying to escape when
you make excuses like that!

109
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,509
Kaori, I trust you. I know you'll be able
to do the job as a professional.

110
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,820
See you.

111
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,826
You cruel man. I see, I understand.

112
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,953
I'll do a perfect job of protecting him.

113
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,773
Well, I'll have a pizza and a cola.
How about you, Grandpa?

114
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,741
I like tush!

115
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,912
Tush is not on the menu!

116
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,113
Seaweed tea.

117
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,013
Sure, wait a second.

118
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,918
This restaurant hasn't trained
their employees properly.

119
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,753
She doesn't treat old people right.

120
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,380
That's your fault, Grandpa.

121
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,293
Hey, Kaori, why don't you stop calling
me Grandpa? Call me Ryonosuke.

122
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,897
Yes, sure, if you stop what
you're doing right now.

123
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,661
What the heck are you talking about?

124
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,393
Your nasty foot!

125
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,163
Hey, Grandpa, are you sure somebody
is trying to get you?

126
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,708
Ryonosuke!

127
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,834
Mr. Ryonosuke...

128
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,577
Good!

129
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,314
Anyway, my house has been
broken into twice recently.

130
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,885
I guess they're targeting houses where
old people live alone.

131
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,054
Oh, no! Leave things to me!

132
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,522
I'll stay at your house tonight and
I'll capture the burglars.

133
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,255
Great! If you do, I'll feel like I have
a hundred people with me.

134
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,198
Well, Ms. Kaori, let's hurry and go to my
house before you change your mind.

135
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,133
But we just ordered.

136
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,435
We can come back tomorrow and eat it.

137
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,902
Hey!

138
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,442
Mr. Ryonosuke, I don't think you
need to hurry like this.

139
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,111
Mokkori has to be quick.

140
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,913
Well, I should say, strike the iron
while it's hot.

141
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,040
This pattern, exactly the same as
someone I know.

142
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,825
Wow, you live in such a big house!

143
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,127
Hey, Ms. Kaori.

144
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,130
To celebrate our new friendship, why don't
we have some wine and cheese?!

145
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,799
No, no. I have to catch burglars.

146
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,289
Well, take it easy.

147
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,770
This is my wine cellar

148
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,939
and the temperature is kept at
14 Celsius all the time.

149
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,340
Bordeaux 1970. This is good.

150
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,644
You know a lot about wine, don't you?

151
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:45,145
My late wife loved it. We drank wine
together all the time.

152
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,591
Well, Mr. Ryonosuke, why don't we
enjoy the wine together tonight?

153
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,118
Well, yes, good idea. Let's have a party!

154
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,637
Mr. Ryonosuke, I can't drink any more.

155
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:10,598
I promised I would catch burglars.

156
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,997
Kaori is a good girl, isn't she?

157
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:35,093
She's just like you when you were young.

158
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,803
The day after tomorrow.

159
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,073
The day I promised you is
the day after tomorrow.

160
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,042
I will protect it until then, no matter
what happens to me.

161
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,347
Oh, Kaori?

162
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,082
You guys!

163
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,965
You're so persistent. I keep saying
I don't have it.

164
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:10,698
Oh, really. Then I have no choice but
to ask your corpse. Hey!

165
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,895
What the hell are you going to do now?

166
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,332
I'm going to break some of your
bones, are you ready?

167
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,214
Who are you?

168
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,916
Ms. Kaori!

169
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,747
You are the burglars, aren't you?

170
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,886
Damn, even though you are a woman,
I won't be gentle with you!

171
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,388
Don't move!

172
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,362
We're professionals.

173
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,830
Do you think you can fool us
with a toy like that?

174
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,825
Do you want to try?

175
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,034
Sure!

176
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,892
Sure, I don't care what happens!

177
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,576
How about that? Do you still
think this is a toy?

178
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,047
Why the hell do you have
something like that?

179
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,015
One more bullet left. Do you
want to try again?

180
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,941
Help me!

181
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,347
You did it! Ms. Kaori, you are so strong!

182
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,294
I've become quite drunk suddenly.

183
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,763
Ms. Kaori, Kaori, are you all right?

184
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,997
Water...

185
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,532
Sure, water.

186
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,969
Damn! What a bitch! I won't forgive her!

187
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,596
What the hell?

188
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,070
Do you also want to see if
this gun is a toy or not?

189
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,182
Oh, no, I've had enough.

190
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,951
Then get the hell out of here!

191
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,145
Yes, yes, yes, Sir!

192
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,659
She has to be disqualified as a bodyguard
because she got sick after she drank.

193
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,559
I value her effort though.

194
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,935
I guess I drank too much wine.

195
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,005
Excuse me, Mr. Ryonosuke, but I don't
think you've told me the whole story.

196
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,905
What were they trying to get from you?

197
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,510
They didn't pay attention to the place
under the family altar.

198
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,281
This is it.

199
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,771
I see, a bottle of wine.

200
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,877
Chateau Madonna, 1867.

201
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,785
This wine was made more than
a hundred years ago?!

202
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,093
This is a vintage wine made
before pro-phyloquicera,

203
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,129
when all the grape vines in France died
because of the bacteria called phyloquicera.

204
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,030
Why do you have such a great
wine, Mr. Ryonosuke?

205
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:25,493
Twenty-five years ago, I had a small
import-export business.

206
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,810
At that time, one of my good clients in
France liked my wife and me.

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,379
The client gave this to us as a gift for
our silver wedding anniversary.

208
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,446
I see.

209
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,746
My wife told me she wanted to keep it
for our golden wedding anniversary.

210
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,288
I guess she was worrying about me
because I was very attractive.

211
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:46,926
Twenty-five years ago. Then your golden
wedding anniversary is this year!

212
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,190
Exactly. It will be the day after tomorrow.

213
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,093
Finally, I can taste this wine with my late wife.

214
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,657
Oh, yes, why don't you join us the
day after tomorrow, Kaori?

215
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:02,236
Good, I'm glad to hear that,
Mr. Ryonosuke. Good...

216
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,751
Kinzou Takamori

217
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,755
I'm sure you got it today, didn't you?

218
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:23,095
Well, that old man has a stone head
and he's hired strange guards.

219
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,187
Strange guards?

220
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:28,701
Yes, an unidentified big man and a
tomboy who wears a mini skirt.

221
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,370
Look, they were pretty good with their guns.

222
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,099
I'm sure they're professionals.

223
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,440
That's enough! Your story makes
my drink taste bad.

224
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,509
I'm not paying you good money
to hear a story like that!

225
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,950
I've managed to take possession of all the
wines I wanted no matter what I had to do.

226
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,078
I even dug them up from the grave
if it was necessary.

227
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,056
This Chateau Madonna is a very rare wine.

228
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,092
It is more valuable than anything
else in my collection.

229
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,660
You have to get it no matter what you do.

230
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,391
Yes, Sir. I will get it for you.

231
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,331
That's it. Go.

232
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,217
Oh, no, I fell asleep! Mr. Ryonosuke,
Mr. Ryonosuke, where are you?

233
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,844
Hi, I'm here.

234
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,221
Good morning...

235
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,190
Yahoo, let's go, Ms. Kaori!

236
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,680
Go where?

237
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,726
To the pool.

238
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,929
But someone is trying to get you!

239
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,631
I'm fine because you are with me, Ms. Kaori.

240
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:37,469
Also, an old man like me has to exercise
daily, or his body becomes very weak.

241
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,902
This is a necessary daily activity.

242
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,802
Your words are very persuasive!

243
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,362
Young girls grow so well nowadays!

244
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,592
Wow, what great scenery!

245
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,095
I was convinced by him. I'm such an idiot.

246
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,971
Ms. Kaori, we don't need to
hurry back home.

247
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,878
Mr. Ryonosuke, you're in danger.

248
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,747
Staying at home is the best way
to protect yourself.

249
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,451
But an old man who can't see well like
me has to train his eyes too.

250
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,782
Be patient, just for today.

251
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,784
You are scary, Ms. Kaori.

252
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,530
Help me, Ms. Kaori!

253
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,724
Mr. Ryonosuke!

254
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,695
Oh, my God! Mr. Ryonosuke
has been kidnapped!

255
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,978
The old man was kidnapped?

256
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,247
Yes, on the way home from the pool.

257
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,416
That's because he went out even
though he was in danger.

258
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,180
Anyway, we have to hurry up and rescue him!

259
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,056
Then what?

260
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,058
What do you mean, "then what?"

261
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,548
I am going out on a date now.

262
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:13,825
Date? I'm in big trouble and you're
going out on a date?

263
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,695
Listen, Kaori. You accepted this job.

264
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,065
If you can't deal with this by yourself,
you should retire.

265
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,582
Sure, I understand! I won't accept
any help from you, never, ever!

266
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,987
Yes, that's right. I'll rescue
Mr. Ryonosuke all by myself!

267
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:46,298
Two guys trying to steal wine, that's
all the information you have?

268
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,597
Please, Mr. Tetsu. I need your information.

269
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,572
Well, I've heard a story
about Kinzou Takamori,

270
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,700
a wine collector, who hired bad guys.

271
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,946
A wine collector? Yes, that must be it!

272
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,850
His house is in the Kawasaki area,
but Kaori, be careful.

273
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,685
His reputation is very bad.

274
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,175
Thank you, Mr. Tetsu.

275
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,489
Did I do good, Ryo?

276
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,560
That was perfect, Tetsu.

277
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,050
I understand you are in a tough situation.

278
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,693
Yes, I don't have time to even
go out on a date.

279
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,941
What the hell is this place?
There are no women here?

280
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,738
Why aren't you getting bored?

281
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,680
You can be a big mouth just for now.

282
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,305
Hey!

283
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,071
Yes, Sir.

284
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,649
Wait for me, Mr. Ryonosuke. I will rescue you.

285
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,694
What the hell was that noise?

286
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,441
Mr. Ryonosuke, run!

287
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,370
Oh, Ms. Kaori, you came to rescue me?!

288
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,208
Chase him! Don't let him go!

289
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,832
What a ridiculous woman she is!

290
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,635
Damn, what the hell are you doing?!
Don't let her do things like that.

291
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,636
Don't let her go alive!

292
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,500
Sir!

293
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,933
Damn, this leads to the basement.
We have to go back.

294
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,580
Here they come. Let's hide in
the basement for now.

295
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,389
Fools, they are like trapped rats now.

296
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,962
Where is he? I can't tell where he is
because of the echoes.

297
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,233
You have to pay me back.

298
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,413
Oh, that's him.

299
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,096
What was that noise? Where are you?

300
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,620
Why don't you stop hiding and come out?

301
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,574
Stop! My wine collection, my
collection is being damaged!

302
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,283
Sure, I'll stop.

303
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:56,345
But you have to promise me that
you'll leave Mr. Ryonosuke alone.

304
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,925
I will. I'm so sorry.

305
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,692
If you break your word, be prepared to
see all these wines destroyed.

306
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,521
Yes, Ma'am, I understand.

307
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,667
You understand?!

308
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,500
Kaori, you did a great job.

309
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,610
Sweety, today is the day.
Let's drink together.

310
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,083
Well, please pour the wine.

311
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,551
This is also a celebration of
Ms. Kaori's independence.

312
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:28,782
Thanks.

313
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,081
This is for you, Ma'am.

314
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,625
And this is for Mr. Ryonosuke and me.

315
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,956
That's it!

316
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,795
I would like to have some.

317
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,599
No! You don't have the right to taste it.

318
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,969
Oh, no, Kaori. Let me taste
a little, just a lick.

319
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,703
No way!

320
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,604
Well, well, Ms. Kaori, why don't you
let him drink some?

321
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,240
Don't worry about him, Mr. Ryonosuke.

322
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,908
You shouldn't let a cold-hearted man
like him drink this wine.

323
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:56,676
If you say so, but I think he is a pretty
good man. I like this man.

324
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,049
I also like this grandpa!

325
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,323
He changes his mind so easily!

326
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,950
Well, it's not a big deal I guess.

327
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,054
To Ms. Kaori's independence!

328
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,063
To Mr. Ryonosuke and his wife's
golden wedding anniversary!

329
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,655
Cheers!

330
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:32,348
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

331
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,822
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

332
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,553
You skip dinner and eat diet food

333
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:47,692
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

334
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:52,104
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

335
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,437
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

336
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:02,541
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

337
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:11,620
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

338
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,525
Don't you, don't you know

339
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:19,898
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

340
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:27,737
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

341

Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,340
Kaori, are you all right?

343

Who are you?

344
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,789
Hey, I don't believe that you
forgot about me.

345
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,359
I feel like I've known you, but I'm not sure.

346
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,556
You fell down the stairs when you tried
to protect me from the gangs.

347
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,164
Don't you remember that?

348
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,654
I can't remember anything.

349
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,555
Excuse me, Mr. Saeba,

350
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,468
but can you tell me what I meant to you?

351
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,904

Goodbye, My Lovely Partner"

353
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,634
