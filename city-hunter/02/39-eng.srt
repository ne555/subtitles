1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,138
I don't think the real world is
really that peaceful,

14
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,163
but we haven't had any clients for so long.

15
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,534
My wallet is very cold.

16
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,679
How persistent!

17
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,112
Go away!

18
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,049
Why not?

19
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,516
Why don't you go out with me?!

20
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,353
No! Cut it out!

21
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,585
After that, why don't we go to the hotel
and have some fun?

22
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,417
What an air-headed jerk he is!


23
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,966
While I've been searching for clients,
he's out like that.

24
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,602
Please, please, please go out with me!

25
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,737
Let me go. I'm going to call the police!

26
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,364
Don't say things like that, please.

27
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,912
Get down!

28
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,047
Get off of me! Pervert!

29
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,652
The feeling is gone now, but that
was an incredibly menacing...

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,861
You shameless pervert!

31
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,230
I can't believe you pushed a woman down
under you in the middle of the day!

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,926
She's right! You, pervert!

33
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:53,928
Umi-chan, What a Sexy Guy!
Beautiful Sweeper Miki Gets Close
(Part 1)

34
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,375
It's true!

35
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,410
I'm sure I heard the noise
of a hammer cocking.

36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,211
Shut up.

37
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,480
Nobody would be able to hear
a noise like that.

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,182
You are just unbelievable!

39
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,184
You don't work. You don't have any money.

40
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,585
You don't have any taste when
it comes to women.

41
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,453
The three worst "don'ts" in a man!

42
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,454
But that's...

43
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,946
Believe me! Someone aimed a gun at me.



44
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:21,935
Kaori!

45
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,596
Oh, no!

46
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,005
Look, he's doing it again.

47
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,700
What kind pervert is he?!

48
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,939
As I thought, someone is trying to get me.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,147
Kaori, are you all right?

50
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,719
At last, you tried to get me.

51
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,522
You've completely lost control
of your taste in women.

52
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,887
Oh, no...

53
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,820
Anyway, you could have chosen
a better place.

54
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,493
No! A rifle was aimed at us from
the top of a building!

55
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,364
Damn!

56
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,169
Hey, who the hell are you standing...

57
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,285
Umibozu?

58
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,420
Ryo, I have something we need to talk about.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,887
Come with me.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,527
Oh, I didn't know there was
a cafe like this here.

61
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,301
But this place is the farthest place
from your image.

62
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,836
We could talk at my place.

63
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,303
Shut up and go in.

64
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,940
Welcome.

65
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,019
How old are you, beautiful girl?

66
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,021
What's your name? Do you have a boyfriend?

67
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,222
Well...

68
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,452
Cut it out!

69
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,567
Excuse me, but what can I get for you today?

70
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,831
Coffee, right, Ryo?

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,362
Yes...

72
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,180
Sorry!

73
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,841
You have something to talk about.

74
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,218
Well, go ahead and hurry up.

75
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,709
I have to ask her out.

76
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:34,500
Well, have you been targeted
by someone recently?

77
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,967
Targeted?

78
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,098
Then, Ryo, that was true a little while ago?

79
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,474
What's the matter with you, talking like that?

80
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,272
You sound like you know what
happened to me today.

81
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,101
What the hell?

82
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,514
Sorry.

83
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,351
What?

84
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,919
Don't do unexpected things like that.

85
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,284
You scared me.

86
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,124
Honestly speaking, the person
who attacked you today

87
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,394
was one of my comrades when I
was in a mercenary troop.

88
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,861
What the hell?

89
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,458
I've been running away from that person.

90
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,565
The other day, that person found out
where I am and came to Japan.

91
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,806
Running away? Is the person that scary?

92
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,244
Well...

93
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:22,215
The reason is that person has been
requesting something of me for a long time.

94
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,118
I can't accept that person's request.

95
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:30,523
Well, anyway, we made a bet.

96
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:36,195
If that person gets you, I will
accept the request.

97
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,165
What a ridiculous bet!
You're so irresponsible!

98
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:43,736
Because of you, girls hit me
and Kaori almost killed me.

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,934
What the hell is the request that
you are so afraid of?

100
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,267
It, it is... Well, that person wants me to...

101
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,409
Ma... Ma...

102
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,548
Marry!

103
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:07,093
No way, the person you're
talking about is a woman?

104
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,996
Yes, a female commando.

105
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:10,897
I'm so sorry.

106
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,525
I never thought she'd really get you.

107
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,830
You're such an idiotic octopus.

108
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,238
But what kind of female commando is she

109
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,002
that this guy hates the idea of
getting married so much?

110
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,749
Looks strong...

111
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,101
You?

112
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,568
No way!

113
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,338
What do you think, Miki?

114
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,830
I set up two situations, but you
failed to win against Saeba.

115
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:01,347
To marry me means to become my partner.

116
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,282
You can't be my partner with such poor skills.


117
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,252
Give up. You've lost the bet.

118
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,888
No, I won't give up yet.

119
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,957
I don't have anybody but you.

120
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,891
I will put Saeba down.

121
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,928
She thinks so seriously about him!

122
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,997
Why does a beautiful woman like her
want a stupid octopus?

123
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,031
Why?

124
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,124
On top of that, why has my life become
the condition for this stupid bet?

125
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,437
Don't worry.

126
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,405
I don't intend to make Miki into a murderer.

127
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,241
What do you mean?

128
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,574
The bullets Miki is using are
special paint bullets.

129
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,313
Even if the bullet hits a person, he won't die.

130
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,941
But the paint will stick to the
body very colorfully.

131
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,354
I told her that she has only
ten bullets to hit Saeba.

132
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,723
Please, Falcon, ten more days, no, one week
will be enough for me to get Saeba.

133
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,119
If I fail to do so...

134
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,959
I'll give you up completely.

135
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,728
I don't have any more to say
since you said that much.

136
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,273
I'm sorry, Ryo, but...

137
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,941
Wait a sec!

138
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,966
I have one condition.

139
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,312
In this circumstance,

140
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,177
I have to gain some kind of benefit
to be involved in this bet.

141
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,782
What do you mean?

142
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,517
Tell me what you want.

143
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,352
Well, it's simple.

144
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,922
If I escape from your attack for a week,

145
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,058
I get one mokkori with you, Miki.
How about that?

146
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,494
Don't be ridiculous!

147
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,962
Oh, really.

148
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,630
Okay, if you say so.

149
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,121
I'll let her hit me at once.

150
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,728
I accept your condition.

151
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,005
He is absolutely right, Falcon.

152
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,942
Since he has to participate in this bet,
he deserves to have a condition like that.

153
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,642
Miki!

154
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,109
Miki!

155
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,478
I did it!

156
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,782
This is the trial of my love which
I have to overcome.

157
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,951
After I overcome it, our love will be real.

158
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,085
Exactly!

159
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,154
Now, I'm getting horny...

160
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,850
No, I have fighting spirit now!

161
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,596
Hi, Miki.

162
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,336
Are you sure?

163
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,738
Yes, a beautiful babe!

164
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,840
You're strange, aren't you?

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,943
I thought you would disappear
from my sight.

166
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,310
I accepted the bet, so I can't adopt
a cowardly attitude like that.

167
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,215
Well, shoot me anytime.

168
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,682
Sure!

169
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,622
I'm so sorry!

170
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,759
What the hell is this?!

171
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,960
Hey, are you okay?

172
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,326
What a place! I won't come here ever again!

173
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,493
Oops, they're gone.

174
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,936
Now you have only nine bullets.

175
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,971
That was a kind of greeting for you.

176
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,768
I didn't expect I would succeed in
hitting you immediately.

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,878
But if I hadn't seen you yesterday
at this place,

178
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,481
I still wouldn't have believed that
you are so good.

179
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,083
I still can't believe that a beautiful
woman like you

180
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,948
is attracted to a sea monster
like Umibozu.

181
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,190
Don't call Falcon such a strange name!

182
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,026
Sorry, sorry!

183
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,895
But why do you like that stupid octopus?

184
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,626
He looks like a gorilla, can't deal with
women, he's really a pervert and...

185
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,333
Only six bullets left.

186
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,307
Five left.

187
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,377
Wow, four left.

188
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,679
You had better stop.

189
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,705
He intends to make you waste bullets
by making you mad at him.

190
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,850
Let me handle him now.

191
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,841
I know all of his weaknesses.

192
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,954
Kaori?

193
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,800
Here you go, temporary truce.

194
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,759
Oh, finally a cup of coffee is served, not a
bullet, just like a normal cafe.

195
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,607
Where did Kaori go?

196
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,074
Bathroom?

197
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,583
Wow! The best mokkori kit!

198
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,352
Bra-panty set! Wait for me!

199
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,377
Hey, wait!

200
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,161
Wait!

201
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,006
Wow, I found a mokkori girl!

202
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,884
Oops, I can't go forward.

203
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,317
Oh, no!

204
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,589
I'm stuck!

205
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,028
Perfect, I got him.

206
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,724
Miki, now he won't able to move!

207
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,300
Damn!

208
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,070
Hey, Kaori, you cheater! You betrayed me!

209
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,204
Shut up!

210
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,673
You're a person who interrupts
someone's love affair,

211
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,142
so stay stuck up there with paint
all over your body.

212
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,443
Now, Miki, hurry up and shoot him.

213
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,910
Yes!

214
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,012
Oh, damn!

215
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,708
The more eager I get, the worse
the mokkori becomes.

216
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:09,854
Well, in this situation, Full Power Mokkori!

217
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,663
Oh, no!


218
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,755
Hurry up and shoot him!

219
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,344
What are you going to do about this?!
My shop!

220
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,108
I won't be able to open this place
for at least a week!

221
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,616
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,617
Well, how about this?

223
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,387
In order to express my apologies, I'll
let you stay at my place for a week.

224
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,389
Which part of that was the apology?

225
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,416
If we live together, you'll have a better
chance to shoot me, won't you?

226
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,432
No, Miki. It's a trick.

227
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,899
Don't listen!

228
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,132
Sure, I'll take the offer.

229
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,638
Wow, I'm so lucky!

230
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,105
Damn...

231
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,269
Well, don't hesitate, come in.

232
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,646
You can use this room as you like,

233
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,773
and you have six more days
until the deadline.

234
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,385
So you don't need to hurry, take
plenty of time to shoot me.

235
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,852
See you later.

236
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,419
Am I a little thoughtless?

237
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,716
But people say nothing ventured,
nothing gained, I think.

238
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:28,634
Kaori, you told Umibozu that she's
going to stay here, didn't you?

239
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,101
Oh? What are you talking about?

240
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,104
Don't try to cover it up.

241
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,368
I can tell it's so, when I see
your composed attitude.

242
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,774
Look!

243
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,547
Don't come closer, cat!

244
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,312
Go away!

245
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,189
Just as I thought.

246
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,892
I knew he would come after Kaori
told him about this,

247
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,060
so I put a very friendly cat in here.

248
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,296
Well, why did you come here?

249
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,966
Are you worried about Miki,
because I might get her?

250
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,968
No, that's not true.

251
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:07,200
You don't want to get married and
planned this bet that she can't win.

252
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,334
But you honestly love her
to death, don't you?

253
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,779
I said, it's not true!

254
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,747
Who would love a woman like her?

255
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,172
I hate women.

256
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,109
Oh, really, then you like men, do you?

257
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,226
I came here to check on the situation.

258
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,229
I'm going home.

259
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,097
I was just kidding...

260
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,039
Why are all these things happening?

261
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,105
What shall I do?!

262
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,817
Ryo, you are a man, so don't try
to get your friend's lover.

263
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,694
Lover?

264
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,992
He denied it very clearly, didn't he?

265
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,565
You don't see it by looking at his face?

266
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,931
Umibozu has fallen desperately
in love with Miki!

267
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,771
If so, why is he trying to run away
from a beautiful woman like her?

268
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,239
I don't understand.

269
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,742
I'm sure there must be some story behind it.

270
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,209
Is it so?

271
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,813
But anyway, he isn't my friend.

272
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,116
Rather than call him so, he is my enemy.

273
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,884
I know he would say the same thing.

274
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,352
Therefore, I don't have any obligation to him.


275
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,117
Shoot, how selfish!

276
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,891
Information Analysis Room

277
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,694
Saeba, I have you!


278
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,973
That's it.

279
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,778
It was a good idea to attack me
in the bathroom where I relax,

280
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,245
but you still underestimate me.

281
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,982
If you really want to shoot me, the only
time you might be able to do so

282
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,041
is when I'm in deep sleep, or when
I don't have any weapons with me.

283
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,498
I think this is a kind of mean way,
but I don't think I need to care

284
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,363
about being fair against a man like him.

285
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,671
Hi!

286
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,440
Oh, Miki.

287
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,744
Such taste! You have been peeking at
me every time. I'm so embarrassed.

288
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,008
If you want to take a bath with me,
first, take off your clothes and...

289
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,817
You gave me good advice to target you
when you don't have any weapons on you.

290
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,318
Thanks for such good advice.

291
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,521
I win, Saeba!

292
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,988
Ready?

293
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,870
A little while ago, when I took
your gun away in the toilet,

294
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,273
I exchanged bullets for blanks.

295
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,434
You used to be a professional, didn't you?
You didn't realize it, did you?

296
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,905
The paint bullets are in the
pocket of my pants.

297
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,614
It won't open!

298
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,252
The door can be locked with this remote.

299
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,388
If you want to open it, take
this remote control and...

300
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,123
Oops, damn.

301
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,590
It slipped out of my hand and
dropped in there.

302
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,062
Oh, my! If you want to have
the remote control,

303
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,364
you have to take a bath with me to get it.

304
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,298
Or it might already be broken.

305
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,504
Well, if you take a bath,
you have to be naked.

306
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,132
I'll help you take off your clothes.

307
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,834
Miki!

308
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,337
Oh, no! Don't!

309
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,513
Shoot! Trying such an obvious trick!

310
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,658
I have no other choice.

311
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,328
In order to prevent you from
attacking Miki tonight,

312
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,997
I'll set traps around this room.

313
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,433
I mean all kinds of traps that
Umibozu taught me.

314
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,126
Whatever you want to do.

315
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,134
Because tonight, she is the one who
will come here to attack me.

316
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,380
If someone is going to be caught
by a trap, it will be her.

317
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,849
Do you intend to hurt her?

318
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,718
No, I won't stop!

319
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,722
No matter what happens, I'll finish him
tonight while he is sleeping.

320
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,724
But I'm asking you not to do that.

321
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:23,729
No, if I stay here any longer,
I don't think I'll be safe.

322
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,060
That is...

323
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,128
Well, I guess she's right.

324
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,798
But in this situation, I can't set any traps.


325
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,005
Wait, I have an idea.


326
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:43,148
Waiting and waiting, one day,
he is working and waiting...

327
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,951
Well, well, come on, Miki, anytime!

328
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:50,012
This time, I don't need to work hard,
because I'm just waiting here.

329
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,376
He protected himself while he's
sleeping by setting traps.

330
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,019
Anyway, with so many traps,
it looks like showing off.

331
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,321
I can't go through all of these.

332
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,399
I guess he's good, or the person
who set the traps is,

333
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,095
but he can't come out from his room easily.

334
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,131
Tonight, I can sleep well.

335
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,078
Success!

336
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,915
Well, I removed the contents of the traps
to make sure no one would get hurt.

337
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,883
I had to prepare so many grenades.

338
00:20:59,224 --> 00:20:59,992
She's late!

339
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,793
What is she doing?!

340
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,251
Yes, I guess she is waiting for me
to fall completely asleep.

341
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,666
She will be here shortly.

342
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,226
I know she'll be here soon.

343
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,148
Why?

344
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,879
She didn't show up!

345
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,724
Lack of sleep and so tense, I'm dizzy...


346
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,547
Kaori actually did it, didn't she?

347
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,191
Sorry, Ryo.

348
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,251
I guess I missed removing the contents
from one of the grenades.

349
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,490
I wonder what he's thinking?

350
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:13,832
He was caught by a trap that he set himself.

351
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,233
He was caught by a trap that he set himself.
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

352
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,769
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

353
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,466
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

354
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:27,368
But I couldn't do so

355
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:37,884
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

356
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:44,284
You don't know the reason I'm here

357
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:59,211
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

358
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,578
I wouldn't have let you go

359
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:10,853
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

360
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:17,094
Everyday life is starting

361
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:27,371
In my mind, time has stopped

362
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:33,711
And a double-decker bus is passing

363
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,221
I'll help Miki win no matter what I have to do.

364
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:43,989
It's useless.

365
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,558
No matter how much you help her,
it's too obvious that I will win.

366
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,560
To help her in a situation like this
is called humanity.

367
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,962
I don't know. I simply accepted the bet.

368
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,964
I think this bet itself is stupid.

369
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,300
How about a duel between us, between
two men who started this.

370
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,568
You wouldn't complain about that,
would you?

371
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,136
How did you come up an idea like that?

372
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,237
City Hunter 2:

373
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,974
"Umi-chan, What a Sexy Guy!
Beautiful Sweeper Miki Gets Close (Part 2)"

374
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,177
If you miss it, someone will steal your lover!

375
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:09,136
Please look forward to the next episode
