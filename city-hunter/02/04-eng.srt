12
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,069
Defeated by Ryo in the
Akemi Tezuka incident,

13
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,607
Silver Fox has targeted me as Ryo's lover to
restore his reputation in the underworld.

14
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,907
But Ryo isn't willing to protect me,
nor does he consider me his lover.

15
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,048
What's worse, I'm just a burden to Ryo.

16
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,017
What should I do? Where should I go?

17
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,451
Kaori in Danger!
Love Means Saying Goodbye
(Part 2)

18
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,906
Hold on! Hold on! It's just me, remember?!

19
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,745
Calm down. I have no intention of
harming you whatsoever!

20
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,122
What are you talking about?

21
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,822
I was just doing my morning exercises is all.

22
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,729
With a handgun and a bazooka?
You're a pro all right.

23
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,219
Ryo could learn a lot from you.

24
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,223
Anyway, what do you want with me?

25
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,568
Barging into someone's room like that
with no warning!

26
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,061
Breakfast is ready.

27
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,965
Breakfast?

28
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:32,240
No need to bother! Eating breakfast
just dulls my brain.

29
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,477
Sorry...

30
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,664
Eating that much in the morning would
make anybody's brain dull.

31
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,840
Umibozu, aren't you going to ask

32
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,206
why I appeared here so suddenly
out of the rain?

33
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,678
Would my asking make any difference?

34
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:10,638
Make any... Not really. I'm a bother, right?

35
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,552
Yes, you are.

36
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,291
I... I guess so. I'd better be going then.

37
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,222
I wouldn't want to put you in danger as well.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,966
Well, you can stay here for a while.

39
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,578
But...

40
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:45,043
As long as you don't barge into my room
or make any awful breakfasts.

41
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,454
Thank you, Umibozu.

42
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,253
Will that do, Ryo?

43
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,062
Thank you, Umibozu.

44
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:05,564
I tell you, always coming to me
with the hard ones.

45
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:10,474
But that's how we make our living
after all. It can't be helped.

46
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,496
Oh, it's you Kaori. What's wrong?
Sneaking around like a cat.

47
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:37,036
Sneaking like a cat?!
Look who's talking, Reika!

48
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,936
Coming into someone's house uninvited!

49
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,640
I hear tell Ryo's partner got fired.

50
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,513
I thought this would happen sometime.
I see. Fired?

51
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,880
I chose to quit! I wasn't fired!

52
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,718
I just had enough of working
with that loser is all!

53
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:59,459
How happy I am! This means
I can team up with Ryo

54
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,361
without having to worry about
you from now on!

55
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,795
I won't allow such a thing!

56
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,254
Do you have the right to stop me?

57
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,661
No.

58
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,640
Or perhaps, you came here to check up on
Ryo because you still have feelings for him.

59
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,211
You... You've got to be kidding!
That mokkori man!

60
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,406
I just came for a change of clothes.

61
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,479
Wasn't your room downstairs?
Ryo's room is on this floor.

62
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:31,850
I just came to say goodbye to Ryo!
I've had enough. Tell him I said hi.

63
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,230
Perhaps I carried my teasing a bit too far.

64
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,256
How frustrating those two are!

65
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,696
They are the only ones who've yet
to realize they'll never be apart.

66
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:54,213
No one wants me around!
All right then! I'll just die!

67
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,737
Just watch me die!

68
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:02,221
Just a second. My life's in danger, so why
don't I just get the police to protect me?

69
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,156
That's it! All I have to do is ask Saeko!

70
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,368
Metropolitan Police

71
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,909
Saeko and Ryo!

72
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,422
That loser! Taking advantage of
my absence like that!

73
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:40,518
No, just maybe he's here to
ask Saeko to protect me.

74
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,586
No, I guess not.

75
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,735
Why go to all the trouble of bringing me
out to a place like this?

76
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,677
It's about Kaori. I hear the
Silver Fox is after her.

77
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,785
That was fast. You're as impressive as ever.

78
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,815
After all, I do have that talented informant
called Reika working for me.

79
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,626
Why did you fire Kaori?

80
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,399
Well, it's like this.

81
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,831
That stupid girl's gone all gaga over me!

82
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,272
She doesn't raise a finger to protect
herself and puts it all on me.

83
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,646
I'm sure she'll be paying you
a visit before long, Saeko.

84
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,015
She'll have forgotten she belongs
to the underworld

85
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,482
and she'll be begging for your protection.

86
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,653
Some loser who won't even try
to put out her own fires

87
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,883
and is all crazy over some guy,

88
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,088
has no right to be City Hunter's partner!

89
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,595
What do you mean, I'm in love with you?

90
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,927
What do you mean, I can't protect myself?

91
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,029
I have no right to be your partner?!

92
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,132
How dare he insult a woman's pride?!

93
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:39,041
Ryo, what's the truth here?
That's not all there is to it, is it?

94
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,649
I made very un-professional
mistakes in front of Kaori.

95
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,907
Not once, but twice.

96
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,814
I mistakenly thought the shot to
her heel had hit Kaori herself.

97
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,191
And I was taken in by my
opponent's trick and fired.

98
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,589
It just isn't like me to make those mistakes.

99
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:05,126
You had an uncharacteristic
loss of composure. Why?

100
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,707
No, I think you already know the reason why.

101
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:20,816
I'm going to protect Kaori from him.
Then it's goodbye.

102
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,313
You won't keep Kaori close to you
where it's dangerous.

103
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,692
You're saying once you get serious about a
woman you can't do this work, right?

104
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,629
I'm a little jealous.

105
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:54,080
Damn! I tighten it down and it breaks.
What a fragile piece of crap!

106
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,851
Umibozu!

107
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:06,692
You're a pro right? An underworld pro, right?
The number one pro, right?

108
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,722
What are you trying, Umibozu?

109
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,959
I thought maybe you'd gone
all gushy over a woman.

110
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,303
You don't go breaking down someone's
door over something stupid like that!

111
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,671
You're paying for that door!

112
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,607
Watch your mouth!
I was just worried about you!

113
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,911
The likes of you can just go die in a ditch!

114
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,175
I ought to just shoot you!

115
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,048
Trouble! Kaori was in the armory!

116
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,661
Look at this! She grabbed all the
weapons she could carry!

117
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,125
Umibozu, what did you do?

118
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,535
That Ryo! Saying whatever he pleases.

119
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,509
Now I have no choice but to show him that
I'm the only one who can be his partner!

120
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,806
Just you watch!

121
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,663
Attention Silver Fox!
I challenge you to a showdown!
Come to Tokyo Harbor Landfill D.
- Kaori Makimura -

122
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,924
What's going on?
She wants a showdown with me?

123
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,538
Developments have taken a
strange turn it appears.

124
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,642
What if it's one of Saeba's traps?!

125
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,502
If so, I must proceed very carefully.

126
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,326
You're causing me a lot of trouble.

127
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,626
But I won't be bothered with you
anymore after this.

128
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,644
Okay, I'm ready any time you are, Silver Fox!

129
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,506
He's here!

130
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,265
Hi there, Kaori!

131
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,434
Ryo! Why are you here?! What's going on?!

132
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,203
That's what I want to ask you.

133
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,805
What did you mean by that message
to the Silver Fox?!

134
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,441
What's it to you?! Leave!

135
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,238
No! Not until you tell me!

136
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,250
You said it!

137
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,319
You're the one who said someone
who can't protect herself

138
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,344
has no right to be your partner!

139
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,851
Leave! I'll take care of the
Silver Fox by myself!

140
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,664
Ryo!

141
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,157
Those words alone are enough.

142
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,804
Protecting my precious Kaori is my job.

143
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:46,105
I'll take care of the rest.
Now, give me that gun.

144
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,506
Say, Ryo...

145
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,218
What? I'm so happy, I'm so happy!
You gave me your brassiere!

146
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,432
But what Ryo really wants is that gun!

147
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,797
You're not Ryo!

148
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,907
What are you saying, Kaori?!
This is your mokkori Ryo here!

149
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:20,174
Shut up! Ryo's not that sweet, and he
wouldn't go mokkori over my bra!

150
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,974
Your disguise is not as clever as your
name would imply, Silver Fox!

151
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,524
Nicely done, I must say.

152
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:37,188
But to think you can face me is
foolhardy beyond measure.

153
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,094
This should be effective even if
my aim is slightly off.

154
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,364
What?! That too?!

155
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,045
What's wrong? You can't seem
to hit me at all!

156
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,190
You won't defeat the Silver Fox like that!

157
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,584
We'll just see about that!

158
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,227
What the...

159
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,777
She's booby-trapped the whole place.

160
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,651
You mean that bazooka fire was used
to drive me into her traps?!

161
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,357
That's right!

162
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,461
You fell for it because you were busy
ridiculing me as an amateur!

163
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,963
And there are still many, many traps left!

164
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,398
Who do you think you're talking to?!

165
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,567
Some miserable traps set by an amateur,

166
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,228
as long as I'm careful...

167
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,300
You still don't understand.

168
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,042
You lose, Silver Fox!

169
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:02,605
I was conferred mastership in traps
by Umibozu himself!

170
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,647
Not the great Umibozu?!

171
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,344
I think I'll observe for a while.

172
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,688
Finally out of the trap zone.

173
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,301
Well? I expect by now you've exhausted
your energy and stamina

174
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,496
and have no strength left to fight.

175
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,441
If you don't want to die, you'd better
give up and get out of town!

176
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,033
Don't mock me!

177
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,323
Think I got him?

178
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,067
Knowing whether you've hit the mark or not,

179
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,973
that's the difference between
an amateur and a pro.

180
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,975
And a pro shoots to make his shots count.

181
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,489
My finger, my finger.

182
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,541
Without that finger, you'll never
pull a trigger again.

183
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,910
Life's going to be tough from now on.

184
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,743
Saeba, you son of a...

185
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,015
Or would you rather die here?

186
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,495
Did I beat him? I beat Silver Fox by myself?

187
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,769
I can't believe it. Did I really do it?

188
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:44,436
You still have a long way to go.
You did well, but...

189
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:06,660
Well? I took care of Silver Fox
by myself, didn't I?

190
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,498
Are you still going to tell me I have
no right to be your partner?

191
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,803
I know Kaori, but you and I...

192
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:19,703
And give me a break! Who are you saying
is all gaga over you?!

193
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,179
Gaga?!

194
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:25,751
I can't stand a cold-hearted,
womanizing maniac!

195
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:30,656
I really want to be around to see how
a crumb like you ends up dying!

196
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,090
So, I'll never quit being your partner!

197
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,524
Okay, I guess we'll figure it out.

198
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,566
Okay, you're going to have to
let me off today.

199
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,210
How dare you?! Who do you think
you are trying to touch me?!

200
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,336
I'm too good for you!

201
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,381
What's happening to me?! My face!
I can't control my thoughts!

202
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,316
You...

203
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,225
You're not Ryo! You survived, Silver Fox!

204
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,692
Don't be crazy! Wait!

205
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,297
I'm the real thing!

206
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,898
Ryo wouldn't go all mokkori
over me like that!

207
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:33,349
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

208
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,823
Marude juni dake kisou Faye Dunaway

209
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,554
Yuushoku mo tabezu ni, diet food

210
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:48,693
Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

211
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,105
Kimi wa kangeki mo sezu morau dake de

212
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,438
Mansion no temae de, say goodbye

213
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:03,542
Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no
otoko to iu mono o

214
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:12,621
Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa
sou wa inai hazu sa

215
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,526
Don't you, don't you know

216
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:20,899
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

217
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:28,738
Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,
ju-yon-kai mo shogezu ni

218
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:34,639
Hontou no dance, chance,
romance wa jibun shidai da ze

219
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,380
A bestselling writer sure doesn't have it easy.

220
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,188
She has to go collect material before
she can start writing.

221
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,725
That doesn't mean she has to get
caught up in a dangerous case!

222
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,959
That was just a coincidence!

223
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,028
Azusa just sticks her nose
into things too much.

224
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,530
I can't keep up with this.

225
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,532
Then we'll just leave the rest up
to Umibozu and...

226
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,368
No way! I'll show you how
hard-boiled I can be!

227
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,836
Oh, you're so worked up about it now.

228
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,204
City Hunter 2:

229
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,002
"A Mischievous Mokkori Detective?!
A Beautiful Writer's Mystery Game"

230
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,767
You'll get the hammer if you don't watch it.

231
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,511
Please look forward to the next episode
