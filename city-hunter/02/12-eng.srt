Fighting Spirit Women's Professional
Wrestling WWWL Championship

13
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,557
In this incredibly hot air, the
grudge battle is flaming up.

14
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,704
The star of Fighting Spirit Women's
Professional Wrestling,

15
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,174
Kumi Akamatsu, and the biggest heel
in this century, Lucifer Rei,

16
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,835
are showing their hatred of
each other by fighting!

17
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,247
The winner will become the champion
of the WWWL, of course.

18
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,249
Not only that, but the loser will
have to shave her head,

19
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,716
so this will be called the
Haircut Death Match!

20
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,615
Oops, Kumi is doing a Pile Driver!

21
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,319
I thought woman's wrestling
was just a play, but...

22
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,720
Stirring bodies! Shining sweat!
Touching skin to skin!

23
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,202
The best of women's sports! This is it!

24
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,363
Oh, I'm going to be addicted...

25
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,280
Lucifer Rei, she can't move!

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,872
Is she going to be cast out
from the ring like this?!

27
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:43,918
Must Be the Bloody Battle Outside the Ring!
Love Cobra Twist

28
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,669
As you saw yesterday, Kumi Akamatsu
is the best athlete

29
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,407
with power, speed, technique and beauty.

30
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:59,868
She is a promising star who will help expand
the women's professional wrestling business.

31
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,813
However, strange things are continuously
happening around her.

32
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,343
You are saying that Kumi is being
harassed by someone, aren't you?

33
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,758
Yes, during the past few days,
somebody played a cheap trick

34
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,125
and cut the rope of the ring
while she was practicing.

35
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,423
An unidentified car crashed into some
fans who wanted her autograph.

36
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,472
Considering these incidents, it might
continue and get worse.

37
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,939
I can't stop worrying about the situation.

38
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,210
Do you have any idea who
may be doing this?

39
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,700
I have no idea at all.

40
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,242
Leave the matter to me.

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,685
Even though they are strong inside the
ring, they are women after all.

42
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:43,056
I'm sure they are frightened by
the unknown dangers.

43
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,253
So, if a knight like me appears
in front of them...

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,030
Don't get so excited just because you haven't
had any mokkori jobs like this for a while.

45
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,692
Oh, weapon attack! No!

46
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,108
Oh, what beautiful scenery!

47
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,269
Indeed, Mr. Fuji is the best
mountain in Japan.

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,018
Lucifer Rei, who lost the
Haircut Death Match,

49
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,610
declared, "I will kill Kumi!"

50
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,455
Number one suspect.

51
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,757
Fighting Spirits Women's
Professional Wrestling
Joint Camp

52
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,336
What a delicious clean atmosphere!
They're all training here.

53
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,567
Their healthy bodies are
created in this place!

54
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,198
What is this great view?

55
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,813
Oh, they are fans. This facility has
regular accommodations

56
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,940
and fans can watch the wrestlers practice.


57
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,520
Oh, what a wonderful smell of girls!

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,487
Wait!

59
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,590
Work is our first priority, isn't it?

60
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,760
Yes, I think so too.

61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,888
Yes, the work I have to do now is...

62
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,429
Close contact bodyguard, skin to skin,
sweat and sweat!

63
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,506
I went shopping to prepare for today.

64
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,236
Ryo! I said WAIT!

65
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,341
I guess he underestimates female
professional wrestlers.

66
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,727
What?

67
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,695
Now, you understand, don't you?
I don't need any bodyguards.

68
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,236
Kumi, you shouldn't say things like that.

69
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,295
Someone is trying to get you.

70
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,634
Why don't you be more obedient
and rely on me?

71
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,805
Right?

72
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,009
Are you saying that you can protect me
with this poor arm?

73
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,091
I came all the way here and I can't
go home without doing anything!

74
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,889
Kumi!

75
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,131
Saeba Special Mokkori Tie-up!

76
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,582
You are an idiot, aren't you?

77
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,981
Your intentions are so clear that
everyone can see them.

78
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,678
But in order to spar, I have to
touch her body, don't I?

79
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,512
What? Who came here to spar?

80
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:37,355
I have something to check on, so
wait here and watch them. Okay?

81
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,031
Yes, Ma'am.

82
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,862
Don't even think about sparring!

83
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,399
Yes, yes, Ma'am! I understand
completely! Yes, Ma'am!

84
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,847
Wow, what a nice smile!

85
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,469
They must hate her the most because
of the Haircut Death Match.

86
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,052
Lucifer Rei!

87
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,253
Well, let's start preparing.

88
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,974
Who is it?!

89
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,441
Oh, damn!

90
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,536
What? There's nobody here.

91
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,248
Now, this is the second time...

92
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,920
...that I have seen fear in your eyes.

93
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,318
How the hell did you get in here?!

94
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,598
I told you that I don't need a bodyguard!

95
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,065
No!

96
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,167
It's my job to bring back your bright smile.

97
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,338
I'm not scared of anything.
Hurry up and get out!

98
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,535
Your obstinacy won't last.

99
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,206
No bra! Nothing!

100
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,653
You can't be unfriendly like that.
I'm your knight.

101
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,348
You haven't got it yet, I guess.

102
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,195
Holding Technique
Cobra Twist

103
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900
I really hate persistent men.

104
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,237
My ribs!

105
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:38,008
I can feel the heat from you all over my body!

106
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,412
I don't like vulgar men either.

107
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,077
Please give me more violent love, Kumi!

108
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,289
Ms. Kumi, you have a phone call.

109
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,792
Who?

110
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,420
Lucifer. Who is this?

111
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,319
A pervert. Kick him out!

112
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,335
Welcome back.

113
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,402
Thanks.

114
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,039
I found out who's behind all this.
Lucifer Rei and her evil troop.

115
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,529
Her evil troop?

116
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,071
It's true. It's because of the Haircut
Death Match the other day.

117
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,941
No way. Even though they lost the match,
they shouldn't get serious.

118
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,941
Hair is very important for women.

119
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,725
Where is she going at a time like this?

120
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,196
I think she got a phone call from Lucifer.

121
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,399
I'm sure she is going to their camp site.
I have to follow her.

122
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,520
Wait, Kumi! Don't go!

123
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,321
Kumi, get down!

124
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,305
What?

125
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,405
Kumi, happy birthday!

126
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,844
Wow, thank you everybody!

127
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,481
What are you two doing here?

128
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,059
I didn't know this was a birthday party.

129
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,617
Congratulations!

130
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,849
Kumi, you are mean.

131
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,443
If you had told me, I would have prepared
a birthday present for you!

132
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,713
Anyhow, you hired a stupid
bodyguard, didn't you?

133
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,859
It wasn't me. My company hired him
without my approval.

134
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,960
Well, it's all right.

135
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,986
A man can be among us and be cheerful,
so we can have fun.

136
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,457
Sure! Let's party!

137
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,625
Finally, I got it.

138
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,836
Kumi and the evil troop are friends.

139
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,039
Of course, we have been training
together for long time.

140
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,778
There's no way I could murder someone!

141
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,012
You sure looked like you would.

142
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,309
Jerk!

143
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,583
Professional wrestling is an entertainment.

144
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,676
Fans should enjoy the show
as much as they can.

145
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,386
Wait!

146
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,921
But please don't misunderstand.

147
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,616
Friendship and the battle in the ring
are totally different things.

148
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,093
She's right. My attack is seriously painful.

149
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,061
Ouch! Ouch!

150
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,858
You win or you lose, it's all up to your skill.

151
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,993
A fixed match? Let them say whatever
they want to. Right, Kumi?

152
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,793
Have you made up your mind yet?

153
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,701
Good, finally, you agree with us.

154
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,370
Well, our boss is waiting for you. Come on.

155
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,471
Kumi, I was looking for you.
What are you doing?

156
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,612
Without the main guest, the party
gets boring. Now, let's go back.

157
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,584
Mr. Saeba!

158
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,821
Who the hell are you?
Who do you think we are?!

159
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,346
I see. I was wondering who you were.

160
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,422
You are members of Ginsei Kai.

161
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,490
You're trying to make fools of us, aren't you?!

162
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,126
Bastard!

163
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,243
Mr. Saeba, you're reckless.

164
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,837
You can't be safe after you
do things like that!

165
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,541
I want to know why you're really frightened.

166
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,954
A fixed match?

167
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:19,288
Yes, they told me that I have to lose
the next match with Lucifer.

168
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,823
If I don't, they'll let gangs into the
arena and it will get violent.

169
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,899
I see. So that's why you're frightened.

170
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,958
So, what are you going to do?

171
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,768
I have no choice.

172
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,702
I can't bear the thought of horrible
things happening to my fans.

173
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,067
They won't come back to enjoy
our matches ever again.

174
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,113
Are you sure?

175
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,014
If you fought in a fixed match, wouldn't
your fans leave you anyway?

176
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,344
I could do it without the fans realizing.

177
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,354
Fans leave their dreams to you.

178
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,187
But a fixed match can't be a fan's dream.


179
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,232
It will be found out immediately.

180
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,359
I know that you already know that.

181
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,229
Of course, I don't want to fight
in a fixed match.

182
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,506
But what else can I do?

183
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,634
I promised you that I would bring
your smile back, didn't I?

184
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,244
Mr. Saeba...

185
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,946
It's late now. Let's go meet up
with everyone else.

186
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,698
What a powerful snore. I can't fall asleep.

187
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,320
Kumi, you don't snore so why
don't you sleep with me?

188
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,466
Mr. Saeba, are you half-asleep?

189
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,636
What's the matter? Why are you so upset?

190
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,366
I didn't do anything to you.

191
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,609
Your face tells me you're hiding something!

192
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,748
Well, their snores are too loud
and I can't sleep over there.

193
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,075
No excuses!

194
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,957
Watch out! Get away from the window!

195
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,627
Ryo!

196
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,330
Kumi, run!

197
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,932
Kumi!

198
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,632
Kaori, you interrupted me
so I couldn't catch them!

199
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,526
Oh, sorry.

200
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,471
What's the matter? What's going on?!

201
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,098
Kumi has been kidnapped!

202
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,765
What the hell?! Who did it?!

203
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,975
I know who did this.

204
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,982
I guess they won't understand the rules
unless I teach them the hard way.

205
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:46,027
Kanto Ginsei Kai

206
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,529
What the hell? Did you say no?!

207
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,731
I can't betray my fans.

208
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,612
I bet lots of money on Lucifer
in the next match.

209
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,706
That has nothing to do with our match.

210
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,475
Are you saying you don't care
if I lose all that money?

211
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,811
Our Women's Professional Wrestling
is not a tool for gambling.

212
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,747
You bitch!

213
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,697
If you try to hurt my fans,
I will protect them!

214
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,995
You don't think I'll let you leave
here safely, do you?

215
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,016
Those guys are not showmen like in
women's professional wrestling.

216
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,483
They are real professionals.

217
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,219
Now, why don't you reconsider?

218
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,458
No way.

219
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,925
Good, Kumi.

220
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,433
Mr. Chairman, if you really want
to have a fixed match,

221
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,401
you need to convince someone else.

222
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,303
Yes, he's right.

223
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,270
Lucifer!

224
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,772
Lucifer Rei!

225
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,486
Here we go.

226
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,790
Now for today's main event.

227
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,095
The evil troop, led by Lucifer Rei,
and the funny gangs.

228
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,330
The battle royal is starting.

229
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,597
I am your commentator and
referee, Ryo Saeba!

230
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,067
Damn! This is nonsense.
Everyone attack them now!

231
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,099
Get them all!

232
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,023
Well, the battle has started.

233
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,389
Already, the situation has
deteriorated into chaos!

234
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,183
First, stomping, stomping!

235
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,193
Next, jumping hip attack! How feminine!

236
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,559
Now, there's the Drill Hall Pile Driver!

237
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,359
Folks, don't try these at home.

238
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,397
I am a referee.

239
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,107
Oops! Now, the orthodox wrestler,
Ms. Kumi is joining the battle!

240
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,943
You jerk!

241
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,127
Here comes Kumi Akamatsu!
Legendary final weapon, Cobra Twist!

242
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,426
I have a painful but happy memory
of this technique!

243
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,531
I can't believe this. The girls are
stronger than the men.

244
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,287
Oops!

245
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,724
That's a violation of the rules, Mr. Chairman.

246
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,532
Damn!

247
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,947
Help me!

248
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,958
If you try to contact Ms. Kumi, you
will be kicked out of the ring

249
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,755
and on your way to Hell.

250
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:39,293
I understand. I promise I won't contact
her at all. Please spare me!

251
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,812
Wow, what a nice morning!
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

252
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,917
Don't thank me.

253
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,750
All of this happened because of your
consideration for the fans.

254
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,756
Lucifer, we're going to have
a fair fight at the match!

255
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,316
Of course! Right, everybody?

256
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,959
Yes, Ma'am!

257
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:32,149
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

258
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,621
Marude juni dake kisou Faye Dunaway

Yuushoku mo tabezu ni, diet food

Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

Kimi wa kangeki mo sezu morau dake de

262
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,236
Mansion no temae de, say goodbye

263
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:02,341
Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no
otoko to iu mono o

264
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:11,419
Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa

265
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,325
Don't you, don't you know

266
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:19,698
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

267
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:27,537
Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,

268
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,436
Hontou no dance, chance,
romance wa jibun shidai da ze

269
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,051
I'm sure that you hate dentists,
don't you, Ryo?

270
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,721
Yes, I love them. Dr. Sayuri is beautiful.

271
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,523
I can't believe that you went there
in the middle of night.

272
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,358
But a burglar targeted her.

273
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,359
Just for your convenience?

274
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,762
Of course, the best way to protect her
is to sneak in there at night.

275
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,253
I see, then why don't you get treated
by her more often?

276
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,533
Win!

277
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,091
Please stop!

278
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,736
City Hunter 2:

279
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,072
"The Most Advanced Smuggling Maneuver!
Treatment By a Beautiful Dentist"

280
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,040
If you don't see it, you'll have cavities!

281
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:07,200
Please look forward to the next episode
