Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

13
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,968
Good! A job! It's a job after so long!

14
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:42,764
What?

15
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:44,304
Female Only

16
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,896
Female Only
Female only?

17
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:50,840
What the hell is this?! Finally we
got a job after so long, but...

18
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,812
Oh, wait a sec.

19
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,748
This means I can...

20
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,884
That's right. I can take this job.

21
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,079
Yes, I am a woman. Indeed a woman!

22
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,522
What's the matter with that woman?
Is she a man?

23
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,922
Could be.
I see. The world is changing.

24
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,218
I'm glad I am a woman.

25
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,365
There's a signal on my mokkori radar.

26
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,663
That handwriting smells like the
writer is a beautiful woman.

27
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,698
Love is Magic
Ms. Magician with a Male Phobia

28
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,772
You are the client?

29
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,914
My name is Naomi Okabe. Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,393
Wow! She is a mokkori lady
just as I expected!

31
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,794
Why did you specify females only?

32
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,402
I'm not good at dealing with men.

33
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:53,606
When my condition is bad, I've lost
consciousness if they just touch my hand.

34
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,609
That's why female only.

35
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,978
A male phobia, you mean?

36
00:02:58,978 --> 00:02:59,774
Yes...

37
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,017
I see. There is no way that
he can do this job.

38
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,143
What?

39
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,756
Oh, nothing. Well, let's start our business.

40
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,724
This is the ransom note.

41
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:14,928
If you don't want to be killed,
decline the succession to the
name of Tenho II!

42
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,429
If you don't want to be killed,
decline the succession to the
name of Tenho II!
If you don't want to be killed,

43
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,159
If you don't want to be killed,
decline the succession to the
name of Tenho II!
Decline the succession to the
name of Tenho the second.

44
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,803
Tenho, is this Tenho Oshida
who died last month?

45
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,105
Yes, he was my teacher.

46
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,841
That means, you're a magician?

47
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,842
Yes...

48
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,913
Then, my job is to be your
bodyguard, isn't it?

49
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,074
Yes, can you do that?

50
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,077
Trust me!

51
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:43,019
I don't care if I lose my life, once
or twice or more, just for you!

52
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,283
Ah, no! Don't touch her!

53
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,812
There she goes, male phobia.

54
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,427
I can't believe that a cute girl
like her has male phobia.

55
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,630
Well, now you understand,
so hurry up and get out.

56
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,632
This job can't be handled by a man.

57
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,429
Then why are you...

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,467
What?!

59
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,163
I'm so sorry! I am a woman!

60
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,471
Still, I can't believe it.

61
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,010
Damn!

62
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,645
How are you feeling, Naomi?

63
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,016
Oh, yes, I'm fine now.

64
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,858
I have to go!

65
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,654
What?

66
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,795
I have to hurry and go home to practice!

67
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,430
Practice? You mean magic?

68
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,431
Yes!

69
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,900
There are only three days before the
ceremony of the succession.

70
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,891
I want to practice as much as I can.

71
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,337
I see...

72
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,244
The bigger the obstacles, the greater
the mokkori! I won't give up!

73
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,283
The magical secrets were stolen?

74
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:22,555
Yes, I'm supposed to debut those
magic tricks at the ceremony,

75
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,258
but I guess someone bribed the personnel
who used to work in my office.

76
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,994
They shouldn't have leaked the information.

77
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,495
I can't stop them.

78
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,798
A huge amount of money has
been paid, I guess,

79
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,528
and also they're working for them now.

80
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,837
On top of that, there have been
mysterious accidents happening

81
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,307
one after another at my office, and
almost all my staff has quit.

82
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,344
A ransom note and mysterious accidents...

83
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,812
Ah, turn there to the left.

84
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,836
Oh, okay.

85
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,250
If they show the magic trick first,

86
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,554
people will think that you're the one
who imitated them, won't they?

87
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,513
That's why I can't postpone the
ceremony even a day.

88
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,057
Oshida Illusion
Staff Wanted

89
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,905
It's too much work for you alone.
I wish I could help you.

90
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,341
Then, can I ask you to be my assistant?

91
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,010
Sure, it's my specialty to be an assistant.

92
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,147
Good, let's practice right now.

93
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,282
Practice? Wait a minute.

94
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,450
The assistant you meant

95
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,386
is the one who goes up on the stage
with you and performs?

96
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,182
Yes!

97
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,723
Ah, not that one. I don't know
anything about magic.

98
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,026
You just move exactly when I tell you to.

99
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,721
It's easy.

100
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,622
I'm in trouble...

101
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,593
Naomi, don't move.

102
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,167
Wow!

103
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,981
Hi, Kaori, it's me.

104
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,778
Don't show an angry face like that.

105
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:00,953
Ryo...

106
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,056
Ah, that's my dress!

107
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,887
What the hell are you thinking?!

108
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,463
You can't handle this case by yourself.
The enemy might be a professional assassin.

109
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,533
Professional? Why do you say that?

110
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,501
My natural sixth sense.

111
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,504
Is anything wrong, Kaori?

112
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,107
What? Oh, no, nothing.

113
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,811
I am Kaori's older sister, Ryoko.
I came to help you. Nice to meet you.

114
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,803
Oh, thank you so much.
Nice to meet you too.

115
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,349
Sister, can I talk to you a second?

116
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,112
Sure, what is it?

117
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,222
What?

118
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,459
Jerk, that is the most expensive bra I have!

119
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,194
Oh, really.

120
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,029
This is too tight for me!

121
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,156
So sorry about it!

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,635
What? Oh, no!

123
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,932
Show me!

124
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,408
How rude! I wear my own panties!

125
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,706
Ah, I shouldn't have seen it...

126
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,970
Who are these people?

127
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,581
Oshida Illusion

128
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,114
Come be a
future magician!
Staff Wanted
Oshida Illusion

129
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,293
Oh, I can't believe it!

130
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,262
Incredible! Please, please do it again!

131
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,107
What are you doing in here?

132
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,039
Mr. Ishikawa...

133
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,582
I'm sorry to tell you this, Naomi,

134
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,753
but this office is owned by
Ishikawa Magic as of today,

135
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,984
so I want you to find somewhere
else for your practice.

136
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,527
No way! I don't accept that.

137
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,762
This place belongs to Mr. Tenho.

138
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:54,100
I am the buyer who purchased this
place directly from Mr. Tenho.

139
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,431
I have the evidence. Here.

140
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,395
Oh, no...

141
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:02,208
Now you get it. I want you to
get out of here right now.

142
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,145
Who the hell are you? Naomi's ceremony
is three days from now.

143
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,113
How can you tell her to
get out right now?!

144
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,548
Please wait for three days. At least,
until the ceremony is over.

145
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,255
I'm sorry, but I can't.

146
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,884
I want you out of here by the
end of today. Understood?

147
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,700
Who was that?

148
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,304
Micky Ishikawa, he is the leader
of Ishikawa Magic.

149
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,141
He buys magical ideas by paying
tons of money,

150
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,336
or bribes members of other magic groups.

151
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,974
No matter what happens, I want to
go ahead with the ceremony.

152
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,812
I wish I could secure a place to practice.

153
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,749
Naomi...

154
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,121
Why don't you come to our place?

155
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,289
What?

156
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,825
No way! It's too dangerous.

157
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,560
Oh, why?

158
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,895
Well...

159
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,464
If you don't like my idea, Kaori,
I can't help.

160
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,466
I didn't say that...

161
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,134
Then, we've decided!

162
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,034
Thank you so very much!

163
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:09,739
You're lucky. I'm going to guard
you all the time.

164
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,438
That's the most worrisome matter for me.

165
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,221
Is a stage like this enough for you?

166
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,688
Sure, it's more than enough!

167
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,126
I'm a little embarrassed to put on
a costume like this.

168
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,027
Oh, no. It fits on you.

169
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,467
Ten seconds after the lid is closed,
please open it.

170
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,301
Ten seconds.

171
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,097
Right!

172
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,103
You can do it.

173
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,272
One, two...

174
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:40,740
What the hell is your costume, Kaori?!
One, two...

175
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,742
What the hell is your costume, Kaori?!

176
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,266
This is my stage costume.

177
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,379
What do you think? Looks good on me,
doesn't it?

178
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,971
Oh, mokkori thigh!

179
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,709
Finally, you understand how attractive I am.

180
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,616
Ultra-mokkori hi-leg!

181
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,156
Naomi, you have beautiful legs!

182
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,125
Even though I'm a woman,
I'm pretty impressed.

183
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,390
I'm gonna pout.

184
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,497
What the hell?

185
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,498
Naomi?

186
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,125
How?!

187
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,466
This stairway is the way to escape.

188
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,904
I see...

189
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,306
It's barely big enough for one person
to go through.

190
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,831
I can't believe that someone
can go through here.

191
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,447
This pattern tricks the eye and makes
the path seem narrower than it is.

192
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,650
I see. Magicians are very smart, aren't they?

193
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,920
Kaori, you shouldn't wear
shirts with this pattern,

194
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,690
because in your case,
your chest will look flatter.

195
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,892
None of your business, jerk!

196
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,193
I'm just kidding!

197
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,592
Hold still!

198
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,302
What the hell?!

199
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,273
That bitch is continuing to practice?!

200
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,877
How long do you think it will take
to prepare that trick?

201
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,646
Ten more days?! I see.

202
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,204
Keep watching her.

203
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,514
I can't believe she hasn't quit yet.

204
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,884
I guess there is no choice but to
kill her before the ceremony.

205
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,334
I'm positive that Ishikawa is the one.

206
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,234
Are you sure?

207
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,672
My sister changes her personality
when she eats.

208
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,343
Ouch!

209
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,845
What did you do to me?!

210
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,014
See, she looks as if she
were a man, doesn't she?

211
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,751
Her facial features also change, don't they?

212
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,154
Oh, is anything on my face?

213
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,424
Yes, rice, sauce and egg...

214
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,259
Oh, no.

215
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,595
Ah, my dress!

216
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,696
Scary...

217
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,187
You sisters are very similar.

218
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,249
Jerk! You don't care how dirty
my clothes get!

219
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm sorry...

220
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,554
Excuse me, but I'll be in trouble if you
take those clothes away from me.

221
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,990
I don't care. Be in trouble!

222
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,457
No way!

223
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,462
Bathroom!

224
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,486
Wait, Kaori!

225
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,530
Naomi!

226
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,435
Naomi! Naomi!

227
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,512
What?

228
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,682
Underwear...

229
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,578
The enemy is men's underwear.

230
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,448
Naomi, are you all right?

231
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,092
What? It's my underwear.

232
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,525
What?

233
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,960
They're your boyfriend's, aren't they?

234
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,935
Oh, yes. That's what it should be,
they're my boyfriend's.

235
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,232
He likes them patterned like this.

236
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,642
I lived with my mother, just the two of us.

237
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,667
And the schools I went to were
all female schools.

238
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,415
You don't have any immunity
to males, I guess.

239
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,250
I'm sure it's just in your mind.

240
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,184
Tenho was a man, wasn't he?

241
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,880
I agree with you, but I'm scared
if a stranger touches me.

242
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,862
What do you think about my sister?

243
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,662
What?

244
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,765
Don't you feel as if she is a man sometimes?

245
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,535
Man? No way...

246
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,138
Her eyes sometimes become so sharp that
I am afraid, but how can I describe it...

247
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,403
I feel some mysterious charm from her.

248
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,980
It's strange, isn't it. We are both women...

249
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,917
Yes, it's strange.

250
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,419
Oops.

251
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,329
I'm sorry, but you've got bad luck at work.

252
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,930
You, who the hell are you?!

253
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,833
.357 magnum! You are!

254
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,542
You finally realize you made
a mistake, don't you?

255
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,979
Oh, my god! I am so sorry!

256
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,416
If you want to live a long time, be quiet
and withdraw from here.

257
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,041
Yes, Sir!

258
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,882
What the hell? You want to quit?

259
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,494
I don't care who City Hunter is!
I paid you a lot!

260
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,860
If you want to quit, pay me the penalty!
Penalty fee!

261
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,564
Damn!

262
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:38,671
Damn! In this situation, I'm not
going to ask anybody's help.

263
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,299
I'm going to make the day of ceremony
become the day of your death.

264
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:46,304
Tenho Oshida II
Name Assumption
Magic Show

265
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,492
From the silk hat, pigeons fly out,
and the rabbit jumps there,

266
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,789
and the cards fly around...

267
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,759
I'm so nervous!

268
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,264
You'll be fine. Do as you did in the rehearsal.

269
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,230
Ah, by the way, where is Ryoko?

270
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,940
Oh, she should be watching the theater,
trying to find suspicious people.

271
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,100
Why?

272
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,113
I don't know why, but I become calm
when Ryoko is watching me.

273
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,076
It's strange, isn't it?

274
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,554
Really, it's strange.

275
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,249
Yes, isn't it?

276
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,797
For now, no problem, I guess.

277
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,505
Well, now the show is about to end.
The final trick for today.

278
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,235
The succession to the name of Tenho
Oshida the Second, the great magician!

279
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,279
Well, I would like to ask five people among
you to come up here to help the show.

280
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,748
Whoever, please come up here!

281
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,150
Me, me...

282
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,352
Okay, you, please come up here.

283
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:37,152
One, two, three, four, five,
you're the last person.

284
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,026
I'm going to give you one sword each.

285
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,362
After Tenho the Second gets into this box,

286
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,922
you will penetrate this box with
the swords one by one.

287
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:51,232
Now! Here comes Tenho Oshida the Second!

288
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,195
What? What was that?

289
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,466
Now, the box is locked!

290
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,095
It's time for you to insert the swords!

291
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,141
What?!

292
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,915
A sword in the stairs?!

293
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,712
Here you go!

294
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,205
What the hell?!

295
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,935
What's the matter? Won't you fire
at me, City Hunter?

296
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,844
You can fire. Fire at me and
destroy this ceremony!

297
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,683
Damn!

298
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,785
Ouch!

299
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,698
This will finish you!

300
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,483
Die!

301
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,223
Naomi! Wake up, Naomi!

302
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,339
You're conscious now.

303
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,982
You can lose consciousness after
you finish your ceremony.

304
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,655
My foot...

305
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,216
Don't worry. I already gave you first aid.

306
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,995
Now, take my hand.

307
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,462
Everybody is waiting for you.

308
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,565
What's the matter? You hate a man's hand?

309
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,139
Throw away narrow definitions such as
man or woman from your mind.

310
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,607
Look at me as a human being just like you.

311
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:55,646
Right, you can use magic on yourself.

312
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,388
Ready?

313
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,840
Damn, let me out! Please let me out!

314
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,914
I'll give you money - as much as you want!
Please stop!


315
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,587
Thank you so very much for everything.

316
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,232
Because of Saeba, I overcame.

317
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,334
Overcame, you mean your male phobia?

318
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,368
Yes!

319
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:48,772
When I think of men and women as just
human beings, I'm completely fine.

320
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,715
Sure you are! Great!


321
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,206
Then, how about here?!

322
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,458
I don't think she's fine...

323
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,757
This is normal! You overdid it!

324
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,098
Yes, I am normal.

325
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:13,498
Yes, I am normal.

340
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,948
Why does the famous beautiful
model know Ryo?

341
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,758
Mary is a professional sweeper, who is
called Bloody Mary in our world.

342
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,961
She knows everything about your past?
She is something.

343
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,563
I've worked with her before.

344
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:56,401
Then, you don't trust me since I don't know
anything about your past, do you?

345
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,003
I am so shocked!

346
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,271
City Hunter 2:

347
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,974
"Good Luck, My Sweeper -
City Streets for Both of Us (Part 1)"

348
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,532
If you miss it, you're going
to be shocked!

349
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,545
Please look forward to the next episode
