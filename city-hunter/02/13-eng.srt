1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,578
There is only one chance.

13
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,622
Good job. It's over.

14
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,500
Finally, I can stop having
anything to do with this!

15
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,674
Goodbye, cavity!

16
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,912
It's coming, coming.

17
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,596
Idiot, he could have gone to a dentist
if he had a tooth-ache.

18
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,632
It was more persistent than I expected.

19
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:02,182
The Most Advanced Smuggling Maneuver!
Treatment By a Beautiful Dentist

20
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,674
Smile Dentistry

21
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,792
Good, it's come out.
You feel better, don't you?

22
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:22,435
I can't believe someone did such
a bad job on your crown,

23
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,604
even though it was done overseas.
I am really sorry.

24
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,232
Oh, no, you don't need to apologize to me.

25
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,735
By the way, may I keep my crown?

26
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,677
Excuse me?

27
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,612
The crown you have. I'd like it as a
souvenir of my work overseas.

28
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,847
It's a rare item, isn't it?

29
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,816
Well,

30
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,484
if you say so.

31
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,054
Be careful!

32
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,260
Oh, never mind. Anyway, just pick it up.

33
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,496
Sure! I am sorry. Well, where did it go?

34
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:53,966
Hurry up!

35
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,196
Oh, I found it.

36
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,232
Here it is.

37
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,382
Sorry, I found it.

38
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,918
Oh, you did.

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,455
Hurry up and give it to me.

40
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,023
But your treatment isn't finished.

41
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,183
That's enough.

42
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,400
Murderer!

43
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,446
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

44
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,382
I've hated dentists since I was a kid!

45
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,652
Let me go! Let me go! No! Stop!

46
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,320
Hello!
Let me go! Let me go! No! Stop!

47
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,720
Let me go! Let me go! No! Stop!

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,555
What? Nobody is here.
Let me go! Let me go! No! Stop!

49
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:53,582
I'm sorry, but the office has just closed.

50
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,787
Is this an emergency?

51
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,788
Shoot! She's cute.

52
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,334
Mokkori reaction!

53
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,002
I've changed my mind.

54
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,095
Hey, Ryo! This place is no good.
We're going somewhere else.

55
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,807
My teeth suddenly started hurting.

56
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,274
I really want you to treat me, please!

57
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,234
Oh, that's not good.

58
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,713
I know it's difficult to endure when
teeth suddenly start hurting.

59
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,305
Well, come to the treatment room.

60
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,542
Yes, yes, yes.

61
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,211
Hey! I thought your teeth were hurting you!

62
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,547
I've loved dentists since I was a kid!

63
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,184
He's a man all right.

64
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:33,796
Nice to meet you. My name is Ryo Saeba.
May I ask your name?

65
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,067
Sayuri Kaionji.

66
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:41,372
Dr. Sayuri, what a beautiful name!
Oh, not only the name, but also...

67
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,712
Well, open your mouth.

68
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,076
Please don't make it hurt.

69
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,618
Okay. Now, please stop talking for a while.

70
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,591
Well, this is it.

71
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,861
I can't see it.

72
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,897
It's good. The cavity is at the first
stage so it will be fixed soon.

73
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,428
Well, let me scrape off this part a little.

74
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:26,809
It's not hurting you, is it? You don't
feel any pain at all! Right?

75
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,858
Once my teeth are fixed, it's my turn.
Wait for me, Dr. Sayuri.

76
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,838
Sayuri, I'll be right there.

77
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,914
Oh, this rope looks easier
to climb up than mine.

78
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,016
Why is this rope here?

79
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,092
Be quiet. We don't intend to kill you.

80
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,071
Tell me now. Where is it?

81
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,107
The money is in the safe downstairs.

82
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,803
Not the money! The thing you stole.

83
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:28,014
Thing? I don't like singing.

84
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,481
Don't joke around!

85
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,713
I guess she wants to be hurt.

86
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:38,758
Hey, that's not true. It's her job
to make people hurt.

87
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,282
Who the hell are you?

88
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,223
Shame on you. It's not right for grown
men to be scaring a woman.

89
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,630
You... you're my patient from
today, aren't you?

90
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,772
Yes, Ma'am. Your lover Ryo,
has come to rescue you!

91
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,138
These men will be going home soon.

92
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,238
What the hell are you talking about?!

93
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,684
Bastard!

94
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,932
You'll pay for this later!

95
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,074
It's okay now. Are you all right?

96
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,744
Mr. Saeba!

97
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,338
Yes! I've been waiting for
this mokkori moment!

98
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,175
Mr. Saeba, why are you here?

99
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:42,722
Well, I happened to be walking by
and I heard you screaming.

100
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,090
Anyway, who were those guys?

101
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,490
They're too low-class to be your
boyfriends, aren't they?

102
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,022
They suddenly came in from the balcony
and told me to give them the thing.

103
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,721
The thing? What thing?

104
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:59,105
I have no idea at all. Mr. Saeba,
I have a favor to ask of you.

105
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:03,769
Can you stay with me tonight?
I will pay you for it.

106
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,812
Pay? Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that,
but are you sure?

107
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,286
Yes, and I am a woman.

108
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,687
She said, "I am a woman".

109
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,848
Until you are satisfied...

110
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,523
Satisfied, satisfied.

111
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,585
Oh, I am stuffed and satisfied!

112
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,326
Did you like my homemade cooking?

113
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,832
Sure, but don't you think
something is missing?

114
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,409
I'm well-rested and full, so in this situation,

115
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:41,814
I'm beginning to feel the last of the
three basic human instincts.

116
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,249
Oh, I know what.

117
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:43,983
Yes!

118
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,318
Money, isn't it?

119
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,285
Oops!

120
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,355
No, not money! One good mokkori!

121
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,489
Mokko what?

122
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,922
Sayuri!

123
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,629
Hello, I'm Kaori Makimura,
assistant to this guy.

124
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,126
I believe I saw you today.

125
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,336
I thought he might have been
visiting you, so...

126
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,005
Are you all right?

127
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,941
He is the most dangerous man
in Japan, so be careful.

128
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,383
Wow, the most dangerous man
in Japan? Excellent!

129
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,884
I wonder if she really understands
the situation?

130
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,877
Well, he's just kicked out
three robbers for me.

131
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,149
Really?

132
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,761
Well, anyway, I'm going to be
staying here tonight too.

133
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,497
If I leave you two alone, he might
do something wrong.

134
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,124
Where are you going?

135
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,160
We're going to sleep in the waiting
room downstairs. Goodnight.

136
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,138
What interesting people they are!

137
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,677
What is that noise? Hey, Ryo!

138
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,519
That jerk has run away!

139
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,369
Creamy custard...

140
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:15,864
Hi, here I am. Can I come in?!

141
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,434
What are you doing here?

142
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,549
Oh, nothing, but I thought I heard
a suspicious noise, so...

143
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,177
You're the only thing that's
suspicious! Here!

144
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:43,993
I'm sorry, he was having a
sleepwalking episode.

145
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,099
Sorry to disturb you.

146
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,643
Goodnight.

147
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,166
Good morning!

148
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,002
Good morning.

149
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,492
Morning, Ryo.

150
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,241
Yes, Kaori, you sit here.

151
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,708
What is it?

152
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,971
Hi, sorry about last night.

153
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,381
I didn't know I had an episode
of sleepwalking.

154
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,448
I wish I were a psychiatrist.
Please take care of yourself.

155
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,284
Yes, I will.

156
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,552
I can't keep my place while
I'm with her somehow.

157
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,490
A cockroach!

158
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,701
What? Where is it! No!

159
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,067
Ryo, do something about it!

160
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:00,141
A cockroach is wandering around.
Is there any food for it?

161
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,883
Ryo! Hurry up and do something about it!

162
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,545
Oh, what is this? A piece of seaweed.

163
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,721
Closed

164
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,424
Open

165
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,627
Mr. Saeba...

166
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:24,059
Sayuri, I'd like to speak with you alone.

167
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:29,705
When I think about you, it feels like my heart
is being squeezed and squeezed.

168
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,443
It's painful, isn't it?

169
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,673
Yes, it is. It's the same as sleepwalking.

170
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,248
I want to be with you in my dream,
want to be with you, want to be...

171
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,685
Is it painful?

172
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:44,349
No, that's not what I meant.
Ms. Sayuri, I need you!

173
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,958
What? Oh, no, all of a sudden...

174
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,732
Oh, Kaori, listen to me!

175
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,328
I will listen to your excuses later.

176
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,352
You misunderstood me! No!

177
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,418
What's the matter now?

178
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,018
I see, I smell something.

179
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,261
Here!

180
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,337
Oh, my God!

181
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,269
Put it out!

182
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,410
Ms. Sayuri, FIRE!

183
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,312
Water! Bring water!

184
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,507
Fire? Where is the fire?

185
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,350
Here, water!

186
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,417
It's empty.

187
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,510
Oh, no! I forgot to get the water!

188
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,115
You forgot to take the bucket!

189
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,360
Kaori, I'm leaving things to you here.

190
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,022
What do you mean, you're leaving
things to me? Hey, Ryo!

191
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,128
Tell me! What is your reason
for sneaking in here?!

192
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,004
Who told you to do this?!

193
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,848
Oh, my God! My best outfit!

194
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,752
Oh, my GOD!

195
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,219
What the hell are they going to do
with things like this?

196
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,696
Ah, oh, no.

197
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,369
Sayuri...

198
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,317
Why?! Why did they do something
cruel like this?!

199
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,342
I didn't do anything wrong!

200
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,853
Here, wipe your tears.

201
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,128
Ah, not this one. Well, where is it?

202
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,363
Here! What?

203
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,531
Here! What the hell?

204
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,498
Here! What? Wow!

205
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,465
Oh? What the hell?

206
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,026
Something's wrong. Where did
my handkerchief go?

207
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,207
You made me take care of the fire and...

208
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,868
What have you been doing?!

209
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:28,821
Oh, please forgive me!
Please, Sayuri and Kaori!

210
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,383
Denied. For punishment, your cavities
will be treated thoroughly. Right?

211
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,860
It won't hurt you.

212
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,464
Oh, no! Stop!

213
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,091
No, no, no!

214
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,498
Help me!

215
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,478
What is it?

216
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,810
It's tear gas! Kaori, hurry up and let me go!

217
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,107
Who are you?!

218
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,886
No! Let me go!

219
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,649
Sayuri!

220
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,247
You jerk!

221
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,103
Oh, no, Ms. Sayuri!

222
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,305
I know that. Hurry up and let me go.

223
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,107
My eyes hurt!

224
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,574
Me too!

225
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,711
Where am I?

226
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,956
Are you conscious now?

227
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,063
Long time no see, doctor.

228
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,335
You, well, excuse me but can you
open your mouth widely?

229
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,200
Then I can probably identify who you are.

230
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,895
Don't be ridiculous! Give me that thing!

231
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,375
That thing?

232
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,842
The tooth. My tooth!

233
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,115
Now I remember. You are
Mr. Kudou, aren't you?

234
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,353
I had so much trouble and finally I
succeeded in bringing it into Japan.

235
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:12,449
And then you had it switched.
What organization do you belong to?

236
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,952
Japan Dentist Association.

237
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,296
Get her!

238
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,122
Oh, no, what are you doing?! Cut it out!

239
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,065
Help me!

240
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,033
Sure I will, Sayuri. Your prince
has come to rescue you.

241
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:29,842
Where?

242
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,537
Damn, where is he?

243
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,508
Here.

244
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,315
Mr. Saeba!

245
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,441
Who the hell are you?

246
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,284
Sayuri has just said, I am Mr. Saeba.

247
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,180
This is what you are looking for, isn't it?

248
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,720
It's the tooth!

249
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,996
A drawing of the new linear engine.

250
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,692
It was not a bad idea to hide a
microfilm inside of your crown.

251
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,624
Now, why don't you give Sayuri back to me?

252
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,538
Damn, well, sure. Hey!

253
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,505
Yes, Sir.

254
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,742
Mr. Saeba!

255
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:07,075
Sorry that I got here late,
but it's okay now. Here.

256
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,211
Thanks for giving it back now, Mr. Saeba.

257
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,823
Since your followers made a
huge mess in her office,

258
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,591
I had a hard time finding it.

259
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,650
Oh, I am sorry.

260
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:26,353
Please accept my apologies.

261
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,203
Stop it!

262
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,179
Did you think I would let you go now
that you know my secret?

263
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,748
I already know what your weakness is.

264
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,582
Get him!

265
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,616
Yes, Sir!

266
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,244
No! Stop it!

267
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,186
What?

268
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,742
I'm just kidding.

269
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,281
Jerk! Why?

270
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,184
Where is she?!

271
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,617
You know, people can get used to this.
Kaori has been training me.

272
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,924
Microfilm...

273
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,484
Your efforts have burst like a bubble.

274
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,577
You should have withdrawn quietly.

275
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,523
Bastard! I won't forgive you! I won't!

276
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,497
Damn! All of you, die!

277
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:26,211
Hi, Ryo. You did a great job as usual.
I will clean up this mess now.

278
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,042
Saeko! Why are you here?

279
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,519
I've been investigating them for a long time.

280
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,084
You were a great help to me.

281
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:42,194
Help? Damn, you used me again
without letting me know.

282
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,928
You owe me this much!

283
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,206
I'm sure you need to pay me back now!

284
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,013
Well, I think I'll pay you back for one of them.

285
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:55,914
Really?

286
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,212
Sure, but what are you going
to do about her now?

287
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,876
Well, Sayuri, let me explain what's going on...

288
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,885
I really hate you, Mr. Saeba.

289
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,295
Oh, no, Sayuri!

290
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,263
Saeko?

291
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,231
Oh, no, Saeko, Sayuri! What shall I do?

292
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,330
Lesson One: A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush. Right?

293
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:32,780
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

294
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:37,255
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

295
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,986
You skip dinner and eat diet food

296
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:48,125
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

297
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,537
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

298
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,870
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

299
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:02,975
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

300
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:12,053
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

301
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,959
Don't you, don't you know

302
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:20,332
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

303
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:28,171
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

304
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:34,070
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

305
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,275
Don't come to us. Don't get
close to us, you jerks.

306
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,154
I won't let you touch my Shoko!

307
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,989
My Shoko? Who the hell is she?

308
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,324
One touch 500 yen, and
shake hands 800 yen.

309
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,828
She charges like that and she is a
saving girl. She charged me a lot.

310
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,297
You wasted money again like that.
I won't forgive you!

311
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,632
See? That's why I decided!

312
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,232
What?

313
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,867
One hammer strike will be 10,000 yen. Okay?

314
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,502
Don't make selfish decisions, idiot.

315
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,837
City Hunter 2:

316
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,007
"Love Can be Superior to Money?
Mokkori vs a Saving Girl"

317
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,634
If you miss it, you'll lose it.

318
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,734
Please look forward to the next episode
