1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,736
Japan...

13
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:56,375
We will arrive at Tokyo International
Airport shortly.

14
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,851
Please fasten your seat belt and...

15
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,921
Don't move!

16
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,783
You see what's going on. So, be quiet!

17
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,453
Mayday! Mayday!

18
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,079
When do they land?

19
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,280
Five minutes from now.

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,804
What are the hijackers' demands?

21
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,716
Unknown.

22
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,753
Hijackers? No way!

23
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:40,525
The Applicant Wants to Be a
Traditional Japanese Woman?!
Mokkori can Overcome National Boundaries.
(Part 1)

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,635
Wow, she's so cute!

25
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,500
Yes, I'm reporting from the site.

26
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,072
My mouth has been defiled!

27
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,699
Shame on you.

28
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,012
Hey, Kaori, I don't like unkempt men
like him. Change the channel back!

29
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,980
Hold on! Look, look at it!

30
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,181
What?

31
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,185
That mokkori body! It's Saeko, isn't it?

32
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,145
She sure is a sexy witch.

33
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,420
What? XYZ? A job offer?!

34
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,197
Ryo!

35
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,000
The hijackers are two foreigners. They're
armed with a shotgun and grenades.

36
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,909
They're asking for a million dollars
and fuel for the plane.

37
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,504
Hostages?

38
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,682
It's strange. All male passengers have
been released except the pilots.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,917
Only females have been held in the plane.

40
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,151
I see. I understand what they want to do.

41
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,331
They are going to exile themselves to
an island in the South Pacific

42
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,128
and create their own harem!

43
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,228
He sounds like he needs to die once.

44
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,297
Well, what do you want me to do?

45
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,010
I want you to take out the hijackers.

46
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,278
I expected you to ask me something like that.

47
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,475
Will you accept this job offer?
I will pay you promptly.

48
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,180
Pay? Promptly?

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,620
Well, have I ever lied to you before? Right?

50
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,826
Oh really, then what the hell are these?!

51
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,130
How are you going to pay for
what you still owe me?

52
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,325
Well, I wonder do I really owe you that much?

53
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,303
Anyway, listen, this time, if you can
release the female hostages,

54
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,931
you'll become a hero to those ladies!

55
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,134
Hero?

56
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,981
Mr. Ryo!

57
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,483
Do whatever you want to do to me.

58
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,280
Hurry up and do mokkori with me!

59
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,115
Harem, harem...

60
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,519
Wow, I'm going to take this job!

61
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,716
Here is a million dollars.

62
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,616
Good, leave it there.

63
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,410
No, I have to confirm that
the hostages are well.

64
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,291
Okay, I need to check you because
you might be carrying weapons.

65
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,226
I wonder what you are wearing
underneath that thick coat?

66
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,922
Sure, here you go.

67
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,940
The Japanese police prepared things
perfectly, didn't they?

68
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,941
What the hell?! No way!

69
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:51,047
Damn! Why do they get to have fun
like that? She has to pay me back.

70
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,056
Wow, well, well, a million dollars
with a beautiful woman!

71
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,492
The service from the Japanese
government is excellent.

72
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,230
Well, now you know. Leave the
money and hurry up and go!

73
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,974
Off course, but let me use the radio
and confirm before I go.

74
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,566
Hey, behave yourself!

75
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:21,542
Are you sure? As soon as I contact
them, they'll start fuelling.

76
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,179
Damn it, come on.

77
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,209
What the hell are you doing? Hurry up
and tell them you're finished.

78
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,214
Ryo, now's the time to take your shot!

79
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,850
Not yet.

80
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,784
What the hell are you thinking?!

81
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,684
I got it.

82
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,862
You bitch!

83
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,531
If I have to die, all of you go with me!

84
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,229
Damn, Ryo did it! He has to pay me back!

85
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,405
Tons of mokkori girls! Oh, so heavenly!

86
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,279
Well, the hero can choose
any girl he wants to.

87
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,008
Which one is best?

88
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,273
That girl or this one? Wow, she's nice!

89
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,777
Nice! I found the target!

90
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,626
Idiot, stop it!

91
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,195
Misa Williams, aren't you?

92
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,605
Yes?

93
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,773
I am Saeko Nogami, of the
Metropolitan Police.

94
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,937
General Jimetil of your country requested
that I guard you during your stay in Japan.

95
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,945
General Jimetil?!

96
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,388
Excuse me, but what's going on?

97
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,289
A very dangerous man is looking for me.

98
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,060
Looking for you?!

99
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,028
Well, I guess I've eluded Ryo.

100
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,833
Ms. Saeko Nogami, Ms. Saeko Nogami.

101
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:59,432
There is a message for you. Please come
to the information counter.

102
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,500
I wonder what it is? Wait here for a second.

103
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,410
Detective!

104
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,809
Don't move, stay here.

105
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,476
Hey, Lapart, the detective is gone.

106
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,539
Okay, Mamora, it's our chance.

107
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,790
Hello! I am Saeba. Ms. Nogami
asked me to guide you.

108
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,559
Where is Ms. Nogami?

109
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:26,632
She was rushed to the hospital for her
acute broken bone appendicitis.

110
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,259
What kind of illness is that?

111
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:33,306
Who the hell is he? Is there anyone else
on this mission besides us?

112
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,364
I don't know.

113
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,635
Hi! Now, it's time to start the
optional tour of Tokyo.

114
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,916
How quick! He must be a professional.

115
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,611
Japan is a busy country, isn't it?

116
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:53,626
For resolving the hijacking incident
I received a reward.
Ryo Saeba

117
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,026
For resolving the hijacking incident
I received a reward.
Ryo Saeba
I received the reward. - Ryo Saeba

118
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,597
What did you do to me, Ryo?!

119
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,762
I guess she's really mad at me by now.

120
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,972
Excuse me.

121
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,634
Are you also a detective like
Ms. Nogami, Mr. Saeba?

122
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,480
I'm in the private detective business.

123
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
I've known Saeko personally
for a long time.

124
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,052
Well, let's say the relationship
between the police and me

125
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,282
is probably closer to being enemies.

126
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,922
Enemies?

127
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,464
Okay, go.

128
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,931
I won't let him escape this time.

129
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,895
Get out of my way! Get out!

130
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,474
Ryo, Pull over!

131
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,375
Saeko?!

132
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,843
Give Ms. Misa back to me!

133
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,743
I'll just get my pay.

134
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,315
If you do something to her, it'll be
an international problem!

135
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,942
There are no national boundaries
for mokkori!

136
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,746
Mr. Saeba!

137
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,284
Please, please run away from the detective!

138
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,789
Ms. Misa!

139
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,256
Saeko, look.

140
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,487
Ryo, don't forget to pay me back for this!

141
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,164
Of course not, you owe me
lots of unpaid bills.

142
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,193
Mr. Saeba, I'll leave things to you.

143
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,605
Okay, Miss, I'll take care of you.

144
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,414
What the hell? He kidnapped her?

145
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,116
If we don't do something, this situation
might become a diplomatic problem.

146
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,986
You're exaggerating the story, I think.

147
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,263
The woman Ryo took with him is

148
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,288
the daughter of the Home Secretary
of the Pamela Republic.

149
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,402
On top of that, General Jimetil, who's
actually in control of the country,

150
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,336
directly requested me to guard her.

151
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,199
I wonder if a war might occur in
the worst-case scenario?

152
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,876
If something happens to her, it might.

153
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,814
Oh, no! It would be a miracle if
nothing happened to her

154
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,441
while she's with a mokkori
pervert like Ryo.

155
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,316
Kaori, do you have any ideas?

156
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,557
Let me handle this. I think
I have no other choice

157
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,025
but to use the secret method of sealing
mokkori, the final weapon.

158
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,139
Wow!

159
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,507
This is Japan!

160
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,475
Your second home country, isn't it?

161
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,441
The books I've read describe Japan as
being built from paper and clay.

162
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,044
And say that all Japanese men are samurai.

163
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,015
Excuse me, but your mother
is Japanese, isn't she?

164
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,718
Mother passed away when
I was five years old.

165
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,160
My mother, I remember she was
such a great lady.

166
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,229
That's why I want to be like her.

167
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,001
That's the reason you came to Japan, is it?

168
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:57,634
Anyway, you are incredibly lucky to
have met me when you arrived.

169
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,236
I'm an expert at raising traditional
Japanese women.

170
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,550
Traditional Japanese women! I know!

171
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,919
The textbook of Japanese women that
Japan can be proud of around the world.

172
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,088
However, that kind of woman
is very rare nowadays.

173
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:15,152
If you want to be like that, I'll teach
you for free, just you and me.

174
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,088
Yes, please.

175
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,866
First of all, a Japanese woman should
show her appreciation

176
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,102
by hugging the person she
appreciates tightly.

177
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,797
Yes, Sir. Thank you very much.

178
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,875
Idiot, do you think you can fire
in a place like this?

179
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,876
But...

180
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,945
What are you going to do
if you hit the woman?

181
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,346
Don't forget that our mission is to kidnap
that woman without harming her.

182
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,780
Wow! Mokkori!

183
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,511
Excuse me but what does that word
you just said, "mokkori", mean?

184
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:49,185
Oh? It's a popular word and
it means "do my best"!

185
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:54,897
Yes, I will mokkori. Where are
we going to mokkori?

186
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,798
Let's think about it after
we leave here, okay?

187
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,997
Mokkori?!

188
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,210
Now, this is the most famous
place in Shinjuku.

189
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,982
Wow, there are so many
mysterious buildings here.

190
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,645
Well, those are the places where girls train
to become traditional Japanese women.

191
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,583
Well, where shall we go in?

192
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,031
What kind of tour guide is he?!
Anybody can tell what he's really thinking.

193
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,591
We have to do something or we're
going to be too conspicuous.

194
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,837
Look, Peeping Tom, there.
Strange dirty old men.

195
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:32,738
Damn!

196
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,139
What the hell are you doing, Lapart?!

197
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,474
I have no choice, Mamora.

198
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,442
If we don't do something, they'll
know we're following them.

199
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,270
But this looks like...

200
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,914
I feel we're more conspicuous than before.

201
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,381
You think so too?

202
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,951
Misa, this is a good place to go in.

203
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,385
Wow, this building is very Japanese.

204
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,857
Now, let's go mokkori!

205
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,290
Mokkori!

206
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,861
Watch out for this pervert!

207
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,224
What the hell is something like
that doing in here?!

208
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,498
What's the matter?

209
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,941
Oh, it's nothing. It's still early,

210
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,704
so why don't we keep sightseeing
a little longer? Right?

211
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,376
Damn! Only Kaori would do
something like that.

212
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,786
What? What is it?

213
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,069
Why is your picture everywhere?
What does it say?

214
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,338
Because I'm so popular.

215
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,736
She got me. I might need to give up
on having fun with Misa.

216
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,541
How unhappy I am!

217
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,117
NO!

218
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,213
Well, Misa, the atmosphere around here
is terrible, so let's go somewhere else.

219
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,262
Excuse me, Mr. Saeba, but you look like you
are running away from something to me.

220
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,003
I'm not running away.

221
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,234
This is physical training for becoming
a traditional Japanese woman.

222
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,876
Well, let's go running once more and
be a good Japanese woman.

223
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,366
Mr. Saeba!

224
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,775
After seeing so many posters, I'm pretty sure
that Ryo won't be able to make mokkori.

225
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,226
Saeko!

226
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,693
Get in the car, Kaori!

227
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,264
Thanks to the posters, we
found out where Ryo is.

228
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,164
Someone reported him to the police.

229
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,704
Really?! Well, then we won't have a war
with the Pamela Republic!

230
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,007
If we can make it on time.

231
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,170
Actually, I have other important information.

232
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,645
Someone is trying to get her?

233
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,983
According to my information, two terrorists
came to Japan following her.

234
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,448
The person who hired them
was General Jimetil.

235
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,162
Wait a second, the person who
asked you to guard her

236
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,652
was also General Jimetil, wasn't he?

237
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,665
Did you know that, in the Pamela Republic,

238
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,001
there are some activists trying to stop
the military dictatorship,

239
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,469
and push the democratic movement forward?

240
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,929
I've heard that in the news.

241
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,078
The leader of the democratic
movement is Misa's father,

242
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,670
the Home Secretary Mr. Williams.

243
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,776
That means Jimetil is trying to kidnap
Misa and stop the movement, right?

244
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,787
Then, the hijackers were also...

245
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,584
The target was Misa.

246
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:42,020
Jimetil asked me to guard her so he'd
know where she would be.

247
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,218
He has underestimated me badly.

248
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,365
EDO YA RYOKAN

249
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,801
The best mood...

250
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,944
Tonight, Misa is going to become a
traditional Japanese woman.

251
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,582
Mr. Saeba?

252
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,549
Yes!

253
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,489
Did I put this on right?

254
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,186
Well, in your case, why don't you
pull it up a little higher?

255
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,793
Is that so?

256
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,129
How about this?

257
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,965
City
Hunter
Good, you have good learning skills.

258
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,298
City
Hunter
Now, we were very busy today
so let's go freshen up!

259
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,661
Wow, a Japanese style bath, right?

260
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,704
Traditional
mixed bathing

261
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:39,447
Finally, here we are. Ryo Saeba,
once in a lifetime mokkori!

262
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,679
What on the earth are you doing?!

263
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,923
You don't need to hesitate.

264
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:49,019
In Japan, it's natural for a woman to
wash a man's back in the bath.

265
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,731
You won't understand the heart of
Japanese culture like that.

266
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,165
Now, I'll turn this way so...

267
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,061
You see, it's okay, right?

268
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,601
How happy I am! Are you ready?

269
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,433
Yes, I'm ready.

270
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,282
You looked like you were good, but
you're an amateur after all.

271
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,648
If you were a pro, you wouldn't have
gotten naked so easily.

272
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,050
Because there's nowhere to
hide your weapon.

273
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,284
Mr. Saeba!

274
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,753
Damn! I lost my mind because
Misa is so sexy.

275
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,196
Well, shut up and put them up.

276
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,461
Let's take the girl to General Jimetil.

277
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,357
General Jimetil?!

278
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:37,433
I guess there's a long story behind this, but if
you want to girl hunt, do it somewhere else.

279
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,011
I guess you want the devils to hear your
stupid jokes when you go to Hell.

280
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:47,219
I see, I understand. I have no choice
except holding my hands up.

281
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,743
If I have to, then...

282
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,888
How about this?!

283
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:00,995
Damn!

284
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,930
Bastard!

285
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:19,043
Such radicals! However, I saw it.
I really saw it!

286
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,945
A real professional uses
whatever he can use.

287
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,958
Mr. Saeba...

288
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,189
Such strange obstacles.
Let's go back to our room.

289
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,365
Hello, Kaori. You also came to
take a bath, didn't you?

290
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,707
National
Shame
You! Such a national shame!
Put on your clothes.

291
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,007
National
Shame

292
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,736
National
Shame
It was really close.

293
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,740
This time, I'll take you sightseeing
across Japan.

294
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,840
No, I want Mr. Saeba to do it.

295
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:55,446
Relax, I'm not a tool of General Jimetil,
and I have good news.

296
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,056
The revolution has started in your country.

297
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,094
A little while ago, I received
a special newscast.

298
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,567
The revolution is progressing smoothly

299
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,400
and there are unsubstantiated reports
General Jimetil has fled the country.

300
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,605
Of course, everything is led by
your father, Mr. Williams.

301
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,968
Papa! Finally...

302
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,645
Screw the revolution! I can't believe they
forgot how much I did for them.

303
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,249
Sir, I don't think it's time for us to give up.

304
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,692
If we get William's daughter...

305
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,593
We haven't succeeded so far, and
that's why we're in this situation.

306
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,464
It was a mistake to have hired terrorists.

307
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,695
At this time, I think we need to send
our faithful followers.

308
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,403
That's right. I still have them.

309
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,983
If something happens to Williams,
the revolution will be over.

310
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,858
Now, we are going to Japan.

311
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,325
Yes, Sir.

312
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:33,149
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

313
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,622
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

314
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,353
You skip dinner and eat diet food

315
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:48,492
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

316
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,904
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

317
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,237
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

318
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:03,342
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

319
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:12,420
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

320
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,326
Don't you, don't you know

321
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:20,699
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

322
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:28,538
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

323
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,437
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

324
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,286
Ryo, outside the window!

325
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,754
Gimetil's bodyguards, aren't they?

326
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,890
They haven't learned yet.
I'm going to finish them.

327
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,125
Hey, Kaori, are you going to
destroy my house?

328
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,493
Don't fire that bazooka so much!

329
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,294
But!

330
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,663
We should withdraw! I'm going to
leave things to you, Umibozu!

331
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,965
Wait! Saeko was captured by them!

332
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,160
Don't worry and hurry up! Saeko will be fine!

333
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,003
City Hunter 2:

334
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,538
"The Applicant Wants to Be a
Traditional Japanese Woman?!

335
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,540
Mokkori Can Overcome National
Boundaries (Part 2)"

336
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,337
If you miss it, I'll bazooka you!

337
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,144
Please look forward to the next episode
