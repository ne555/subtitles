12
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,936
Wow, how beautiful these carnations are!
Smells good...

13
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,130
Hey, Kaori, let's go!

14
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,167
Ryo, do you know the flower
language of carnations?

15
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,666
Flower language? I'm not
interested in it at all.

16
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,513
A carnation with a variegated
pattern means sad love,

17
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,244
yellow means contempt, and
white means pure love.

18
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,886
White ones are definitely the best.

19
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,920
They sure are.

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,388
Especially, the ones with lace work frill.

21
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,394
Damn, girls nowadays protect
themselves too much.

22
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,725
I was enjoying the romantic feeling, you jerk!

23
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,700
Wait, Ryo!

24
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,635
Hey, I said, wait!

25
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,493
Help me!

26
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,776
I understand, Kaori, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,379
I will buy you any flowers you want.

28
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,937
If you don't want to, I don't need it.

29
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:31,984
Ryo!

30
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,542
Watch out, Ryo!

31
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,811
Look out, Kaori!

32
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:40,718
Kaori!

33
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,663
Kaori, hang in there, Kaori!

34
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:59,701
Kaori Gets Amnesia!
Goodbye, My Lovely Partner

35
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,112
Ryo!

36
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,313
How is Kaori?

37
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,390
The treatment is over. Please come in.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,801
Are you all right, Kaori?

39
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:25,134
I was so surprised when I heard that you fell
down the stairs of the pedestrian overpass.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,838
Excuse me, but who are you people?

41
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,310
Kaori...

42
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,211
It seems like she has retrograde amnesia
from the brain concussion.

43
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,286
Amnesia?

44
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:45,019
Yes, but it may be a brain contusion
or encephalitis.

45
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:50,195
I can't be certain until I see the test results.

46
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,336
Will she get her memory back, Doctor?

47
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:01,608
It might come back right away,
or it might never come back.

48
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,066
There are some cases where a shock
brings the memory back suddenly.

49
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,980
Please talk to the patient, about anything.

50
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,152
The best way is to give her hints
about her lost memories.

51
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,048
Yes!

52
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,006
Hi!

53
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,208
Mr. Saeba, right?

54
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,776
Yes, I am.

55
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,041
I feel like I've known you for a long time.

56
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,676
It's been my pleasure.

57
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,951
Well, do you remember me then?

58
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,985
How about me?

59
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,045
Well...

60
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,590
Just Ryo, I guess.

61
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,558
Wait, let's see...

62
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,959
Don't think too hard, Kaori.
Well, I'm going to introduce myself.

63
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,928
I am Reika Nogami, this is
Saeko Nogami, my elder sister.

64
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,162
Ms. Reika and Ms. Saeko...

65
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,594
Actually, Reika and I are
getting married soon.

66
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,277
What are you talking about, Ryo?

67
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:15,270
She might get her memory back
because of the shock. Well, smile.

68
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,508
You look like a great couple. Congratulations.

69
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,213
It didn't work at all, I guess.

70
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,627
Then we have no choice but to show her
our hardcore love scene.

71
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,295
What the hell are you talking about?!

72
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,497
This is shock treatment, you know.

73
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,930
For Kaori only

74
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,201
I'm just kidding.

75
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,765
Why do I have things like this?

76
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,566
It's a kind of automatic reaction.

77
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,376
Reaction?

78
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,675
Do I carry things like this around
with me all the time?

79
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,582
I feel sorry for the person I beat with this.

80
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,418
She's sorry for you.

81
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,854
How impressive, I almost started crying.

82
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:59,052
My dark days when I was living in fear
of the sneaking hammer!

83
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,587
I am sorry, Mr. Saeba. I caused
you so much trouble.

84
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,533
Something is different from
the way she used to be.

85
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,229
I'm sure this is Kaori's real character.

86
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,231
I see, she was an ordinary girl
before she knew Ryo.

87
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,243
I have to be careful too.

88
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,906
You, don't talk about me as if
I'm some kind of bacteria.

89
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,281
It's just a joke.

90
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,716
Damn!

91
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,650
Ryo, where are you going?

92
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,755
I'm just exploring for a white uniform
flower garden. See you.

93
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,222
Ryo!

94
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,522
I can't believe he's doing that at a
time like this!

95
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,194
Leave him alone, Reika.

96
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,329
But, Sister!

97
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,925
He didn't say so, but I'm sure
he was pretty upset.

98
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,937
Who is this guy? No!

99
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,429
Hey, hey, mokkori with me! Why are you
running away from me?!

100
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,778
How can you think he's upset?

101
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,245
I take it back.

102
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,812
When is your wedding ceremony?
I wonder if I can attend or not?

103
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:06,454
Oh no, Kaori. The wedding thing
was just a joke. A lie!

104
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,463
A lie? Then what kind of relationship
do you and Mr. Saeba have?

105
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,626
Our relationship is not as strong as
yours and Ryo's, so don't worry.

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,668
What do you mean?

107
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,604
How can I explain this to you?

108
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,303
Well, you, Kaori, help with his
business, and cook for him.

109
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,199
Business and meals?

110
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,845
Are we married or something?

111
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,752
Not yet.

112
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,220
Not yet? What do you mean?

113
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,356
Let's see. Well, say something!

114
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:44,730
Right, I have to bring you your toothbrush,
towels and other stuff.

115
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,632
I'm going to go to the shop downstairs.

116
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,099
Reika!

117
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,538
Well, I have to go to your apartment
and bring you some clothes.

118
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,234
I will be right back so rest for a while.
See you later.

119
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,783
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,227
I was thinking of recruiting my new partner.

121
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,595
What the hell?

122
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,899
I don't want to work with a violent
woman like Kaori anymore.

123
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,493
I'm going to find a gentle lady this time.

124
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,470
A gentle lady!

125
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,098
I see. Another idea. Can I have you
as my new partner, Reika?

126
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,702
Ouch! What the hell are you doing?

127
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,273
No way. How can you can say things
like that at a time like this!?

128
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,717
I consider this is as a practical
problem to solve.

129
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,320
Practical problem? I can't believe
you're such a selfish man!

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,787
You are the worst!

131
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,119
What's the matter, Ryo? You don't
look like your usual self.

132
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,166
I understand that you don't want to face
the problem with Kaori, but...

133
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,224
Saeko...

134
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,162
Can you investigate the license plate
number of the car that fired at me?

135
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,406
Sure thing.

136
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,873
Sorry.

137
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,743
Ryo, where are you going?

138
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,711
I'm going to get some flowers for Kaori.

139
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,061
Carnations?

140
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,529
Mr. Saeba?

141
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,333
Those carnations, did you
bring them for me?

142
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,505
You told me that you like those, Kaori.

143
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,100
Thank you.

144
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,150
Mr. Saeba, can I ask some
sensitive questions?

145
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,984
What?

146
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,681
What do you think of Ms. Reika
and Ms. Saeko?

147
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,089
What do I think of them?

148
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,422
I can tell that both of them
love you, Mr. Saeba.

149
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,284
Is that the woman's so-called sixth sense?

150
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,663
No, not like that.

151
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,064
I can tell how they're feeling, because
I have someone I love.

152
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,136
I shouldn't have said that.

153
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,808
I can't remember anything
about the man I love,

154
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,971
but he was close to me and
protected me all the time.

155
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,748
But somehow, he never said he loved me.

156
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,716
Even though he knew how I felt about him.

157
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,051
I'm sure that he was just too shy
to say he loves you.

158
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,990
Are you shy just like him?

159
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,159
I...

160
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,561
Men are selfish, I guess.

161
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,856
Oh damn, I have to call my brother.

162
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,433
He'll be surprised to hear that
I am in the hospital.

163
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,139
I already told him.

164
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,042
Do you know my brother, Mr. Saeba?

165
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,836
Yes, Makimura is my partner.

166
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,946
He said he's out of town and can't
come to see you today.

167
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,739
I see.

168
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,053
He can't come.

169
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,255
Well, I have to go back to work.

170
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,847
Thank you for coming.

171
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,258
Mr. Saeba, can you come
and visit me again?

172
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,806
How was Kaori? Did she remember anything?

173
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,705
No, she believes Makimura is still alive.

174
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,381
She would be happier if
she didn't remember.

175
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,552
What are you talking about, Ryo?!

176
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,117
Kaori is trying so hard to remember you!

177
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,758
Ryo!

178
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,262
Ryo, what are you going to do
with Kaori's belongings?

179
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,209
I found a vacancy at the apartment
where Makimura used to live.

180
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,379
No way.

181
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,651
As long as she stays with me, things like
this will keep happening to her.

182
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,178
It might cost her not only her memory,
but also her life.

183
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,956
Ryo!

184
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,963
Oh yes, about the car you asked
me about yesterday,

185
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,133
it was a stolen car and
hasn't been found yet.

186
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,157
I see.

187
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,035
Hello, yes, this is Saeba.

188
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,009
It's me, Ryo, shoe-shining Tetsu.

189
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,011
Tetsu, where are you calling from?

190
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,310
In front of your house. I have some
interesting information.

191
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,117
Ryo, you're being targeted by
two strange gangsters.

192
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,683
Two gangsters?

193
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,192
They're mentally unstable somehow.

194
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,286
They want to become famous in the
underground world by killing you.

195
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,626
I see. Where are they?

196
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,659
I've heard they live in the warehouse
of a closed factory near Harumi.

197
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,636
They allowed themselves to be traced there.

198
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,707
I guess they're confident they can kill you.

199
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,834
It looks like they want you to come to them.

200
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,879
Harumi, a good place to have fun.

201
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,076
One of them is good at shooting, another
one is good at setting traps.

202
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,549
Sounds good. Thank you, Tetsu.

203
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,956
You found out who shot at you, didn't you?

204
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,255
Yes, I'm going to go and ask them to
pay Kaori's hospital expenses.

205
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,532
Wow, he gets so excited.

206
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,660
I don't think those guys have long to live.

207
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,301
Hello, Kaori.

208
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,936
Ms. Reika, hello.

209
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,944
Oh, no, white flowers at the
hospital are bad luck.

210
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:40,452
Mr. Saeba brought them to me because
I liked them, he said.

211
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,181
He doesn't normally do things like that.

212
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,045
What?

213
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,651
This is a different kind of flower. Look.

214
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,688
The flower language for sweat peas!

215
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,689
What? What is the flower language?

216
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,735
Eternal separation.

217
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,771
There's no way Ryo could have known that.

218
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:04,004
Ms. Reika, please take me to where
Mr. Saeba lives. Please.

219
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,125
Kaori hides her hammers in here.

220
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,593
I wonder if I can have one?

221
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,729
What the hell is this?!

222
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,433
Kaori's belongings are gone!

223
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,060
Is this my room?

224
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,095
Kaori, are you well enough to go out?

225
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,599
What the hell is going on here, Sister?!

226
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,934
Not me. Ryo did it, but listen, Kaori.

227
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,541
He did this because he's concerned for you.

228
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,743
Well, where is Mr. Saeba?

229
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,183
He had an urgent matter to take care of.

230
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,317
If you know where he is, tell me.

231
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,807
I'm going to give him another punch!

232
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,544
Calm down.

233
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,290
Ryo went to Harumi because he had
to take care of something.

234
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,416
Harumi?!

235
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,924
Kaori, wait!

236
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,230
Kaori!



237
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,968
I have to hear it from him.

238
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,168
I have to hear what he really thinks
directly from him!

239
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,677
She's gone.

240
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,424
Do you think he is really coming, Bro?

241
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,654
I'm sure he will. Watch carefully.

242
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,197
After we kill City Hunter, we're gonna be
top class professionals, Brother.

243
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,687
Sure, we will!

244
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,101
Here he comes, Bro.

245
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,398
Don't miss this chance!

246
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,503
Take your aim carefully.

247
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,582
Can he see us?!

248
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,148
What are you doing?
Hurry up and shoot him!

249
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,679
Damn, where did he go?

250
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,359
Stuff happens. Well, let's finish him now.

251
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,272
Brother, did we kill him?

252
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,605
Sure, if he's alive after all those explosive
traps, he's not human.

253
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,211
We did it!

254
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,351
Brother!

255
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,757
What kind of man is he?!

256
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,607
Now he'll be the target of a
shooting game for me.

257
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,449
I guess he has given up his life now.

258
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,522
What the hell?!

259
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,498
We can't get him. Let's go, Brother.

260
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,893
Damn, in that case, come with me.

261
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,243
This is Mr. Saeba's car.

262
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,516
Oil!

263
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,679
Let's start the barbecue party!

264
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,332
Even if you are the City Hunter,
you're finished now.

265
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,299
Who are you?!

266
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,771
That woman, she was with
City Hunter the other day.

267
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,738
Get her.

268
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,799
Wait!

269
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:57,342
Let me go!

270
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,477
Let me go!
Wait a second. You can see the end
of life for City Hunter.

271
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,570
Wait a second. You can see the end
of life for City Hunter.

272
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,672
City Hunter, you mean Mr. Saeba is...

273
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,918
You didn't know that?

274
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,524
Mr. Saeba!

275
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,862
Mr. Saeba!

276
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,364
What the hell is he?!

277
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,176
Bastards, let Kaori go!

278
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,973
Play time is over.

279
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,716
What a big mouth. I'll show you play time.

280
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,310
If you don't wanna lose this woman,
throw your gun towards me.

281
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,755
Ouch!

282
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,528
Bastard!

283
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,698
Kaori!

284
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,646
Kaori!

285
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,283
I... I found out who I loved.

286
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,716
That sweet pea, was that how you really feel?

287
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,415
Is that why you had my belongings moved?

288
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,121
You had better not speak now.

289
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:29,556
Let me speak. Mr. Saeba, do you
hate me that much?

290
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,872
Please, please tell me what you really think.

291
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,407
I understand.

292
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,845
Kaori, I...

293
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,253
Kaori! Hold on!

294
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,514
Kaori!

295
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:11,972
Kaori!

296
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,183
Wow, I slept so well!

297
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,943
What are you all doing here?

298
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,523
What is this bandage?

299
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,426
I guess I fell down the stairs
of the overpass and...

300
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,061
Kaori?

301
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,596
Her memory must have come back.

302
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,858
Yes, it's back.

303
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,164
I had amnesia?

304
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,063
Yes, the situation was pretty
critical at one point.

305
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,905
While my memory was gone, I must have
caused you guys a lot of trouble.

306
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,010
Thank you very much.

307
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,881
Oh, no, don't thank us. Anyway, I'm glad
you got your memory back.

308
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,907
It seems like there is one person who
is not really happy about it.

309
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,454
Where is he?

310
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,944
Why are you hiding, hey?!

311
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,259
Well, I'm glad you're okay now, Kaori.

312
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,662
You, you did something that you can't
tell me about, didn't you, Ryo?

313
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,297
My stuff is gone!

314
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,673
He moved it by himself.

315
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,975
I said no, but he did it anyway.

316
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,110
I see.

317
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,705
While my memory was gone, you tried to
kick me out of here, didn't you?

318
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,448
Oh, no way!

319
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:28,317
Actually, he did. Ryo said it was a good
chance to say goodbye to you.

320
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,884
Ryo!

321
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,523
Please forgive me, Kaori. I'm so sorry.

322
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,425
Well, I guess I forgive you this time.

323
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,732
No, Kaori, you should be harder
on him than that.

324
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,495
That's right! I'll support you!

325
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,202
That's okay.

326
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,401
I wonder if she's really got her
memory back completely?

327
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,610
I had a really good dream
while I was sleeping.

328
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,077
Good dream?

329
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,045
Ryo told me...

330
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,909
He told you what?

331
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,142
It's a secret.

332
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,520
She can dream whatever she wants to.

333
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,050
He says dream.

334
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,459
It might be a good thing to get amnesia.

335
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,689
Me too.

336
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:33,515
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

Oh, no! I didn't know Seiko
was this beautiful!

349
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,156
She's a female police officer who's a
candidate for Olympic target shooting?

350
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,925
Yes, she is. I'm glad that I accepted
the position as her coach.

351
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,361
But somebody is trying to attack her. Why?

352
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,497
I have no idea. Every time Saeko asks
me to work, it's usually like this.

353
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,332
However, Seiko is beautiful,
so I can forgive her.

354
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,369
Just as I thought. You don't have any
thoughts about national honor, do you, Ryo?

355
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,837
City Hunter 2:

356
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,873
"Aim for the Gold Medal!
Intimate Training for the Shooting Beauty"

357
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,307
If you don't watch it, you won't be able
to participate in the Olympics.

358
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,578
Please look forward to the next episode
