1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blended in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,513
Welcome.

14
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,316
Gin on the rocks, please.

15
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,783
Sure.

16
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,188
Here, you go.

17
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,990
I found you, Lady.

18
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,197
Let me go!

19
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,967
Be quiet and come with us.

20
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,438
What the hell?

21
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,265
It's trouble for me if you
disturb my business.

22
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,874
Do you want to throw your life away
just for this poor business?

23
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,543
Sorry, but risking my life is my job.

24
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,858
An XYZ cocktail; why don't we toast
hopeless guys like you?

25
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,893
Bastard!

26
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,758
No fooling around!

27
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,143
You're Hiromi Ayuhara, aren't you?

28
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,640
You're Mr. Saeba?

29
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:07,142
Mokkori Contract!
The Strange Journey of Ryo & a Bad Girl
(Part 1)

30
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,182
I want you to look for someone.

31
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,162
If you are searching for someone,
you should go to the police.

32
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,629
They'd do it for you for free.

33
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,455
If I could ask this of the police,
I wouldn't have asked you.

34
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,970
You're right.

35
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,872
It sounds like a troublesome job.

36
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,635
I'll pay you somehow.

37
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,303
Don't underestimate me.

38
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,768
Do I look like a man who
works just for money?

39
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,248
Then what shall I do?

40
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,950
Mokkori ONCE!

41
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,417
Mokkori?!

42
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,923
If you can't pay me at once,
you could take out a loan.

43
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,125
For now, the down payment
you need to make is...

44
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,491
Let me do like this!

45
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,841
Hi, how're you doing?

46
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,743
That was close.

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,246
I'm his assistant, Kaori Makimura.

48
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,076
Hello...

49
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,842
She doesn't look like a good girl.

50
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,819
She's Sakura Morimura.

51
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,487
She'll become my sister-in-law soon.

52
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,011
She'll be your sister-in-law soon?

53
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,993
I'll be marrying her older brother.

54
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,862
Congratulations.

55
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,398
Hey, Ryo, what kind of face is that?!

56
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,334
Jeez, you're going to get married.

57
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,637
I'm so disappointed.

58
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,173
Well, that's fine. I've totally lost my interest.

59
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,908
Mr. Saeba, please.

60
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,308
I'll keep the promise I made to you
a little while ago.

61
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,550
Promise? Which means...

62
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,218
Marriage Mokkori Once
Promise? Which means...

63
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:45,980
Marriage Mokkori Once

64
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,887
Before Marriage Mokkori Once

65
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:48,755
Before Marriage Mokkori Once
Mokkori once before she gets married!

66
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,882
Mokkori once before she gets married!

67
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,693
I understand.

68
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,187
I, Ryo Saeba, promise to find your
sister-in-law-to-be, and bring her to you.


69
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,667
Gee, I wonder what he was promised?

70
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,280
Oh, you're certainly a brave
young man, aren't you?

71
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,413
Why don't you say something?

72
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,193
Mr. Saeba!

73
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,395
Hey, did you find out?

74
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,297
Of course!

75
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:35,601
Since it was your request, Mr. Saeba, all the
young followers worked and investigated.

76
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,402
Well?

77
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,871
Well, well, it's not a good idea to talk
standing around like this,

78
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,862
so let's go to this good restaurant
I know. Okay?

79
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,309
Your taste is incredible.

80
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,115
It's embarrassing to be praised like that.

81
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,348
About this woman...

82
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,824
What did you find out?

83
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,960
She's cute, but she's the
queen of the Pirates.

84
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,230
The Pirates? The street gang?

85
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,264
Yeah...

86
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,067
The water front area is their base and
they do whatever they want to.


87
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,865
They're untouchable, bad young kids.

88
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,373
Thank you.

89
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,108
I'll pay you for this sometime later.

90
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,575
Are you sure?

91
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,278
I am so happy to hear that.

92
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,441
Why don't you come to my place now?
I'll cook something for you.

93
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,417
Someday, okay?

94
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,251
See you!

95
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,309
Mr. Saeba!

96
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,921
My honey...

97
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,921
Ya-hoo!

98
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,659
No!

99
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,164
I admire you just for your bravery.

100
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,672
I can't believe that you got
involved with our girl.

101
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,908
Why don't you teach this middle-aged man

102
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,877
what's going to happen to him since he
underestimated us, the Pirates.

103
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,109
Hey, stand up, you old fart!

104
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,010
Don't get excited, idiot!

105
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,287
Jerk!

106
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,618
Where did he go?!

107
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,724
Who the hell is this man?!

108
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,992
You jerk!

109
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,127
I see...

110
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,255
As I thought, a sixteen-year-old ass
is not enough for mokkori.

111
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,501
Is this man insane?

112
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,800
I have something to tell this girl, Sakura.

113
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,239
Shall we go now?

114
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,968
What the hell is going on?!

115
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,642
Wait a damn minute!

116
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,536
Do you think you're going to
leave here alive?

117
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,217
I'll bet on alive.

118
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,185
Jerk!

119
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,913
Die!

120
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,960
Captain!

121
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,830
Oh, my.

122
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,526
And he was bragging that he'd
never lost a fight.

123
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,698
That's probably because he always
attacked from behind.

124
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,167
You, you're strong, aren't you?

125
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,941
Shall we go?

126
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,409
I like a strong man.

127
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,812
Sakura...

128
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,146
You're the worst loser.

129
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,613
Let's go.

130
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,477
Damn!

131
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,746
I will make them pay for this.

132
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,260
You're brave, aren't you?

133
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,329
Even the police get scared when they
hear the name of the Pirates.

134
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,526
Well, your friends were lovely.

135
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,669
Hey, I'm your target, right?

136
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,738
Should I become your girlfriend?

137
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,299
I'm sorry, but kids aren't included in
the category of my girlfriends.

138
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,936
My job is to take you to someone.

139
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,346
Someone?

140
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,109
Your sister-in-law-to-be.

141
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,211
That bitch was the one that asked you?!

142
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,888
Based on your response, you don't
like her very much, do you?

143
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,023
Absolutely not.

144
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,124
Stop the car!

145
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,625
Stop!

146
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,719
Bastard! Let me off!

147
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,509
That's what you get.

148
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,581
Well, well...

149
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,607
You want to swim at this time of year.
What a strange kid you are!

150
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,642
Damn!

151
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,251
See, you might catch cold.

152
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,694
Wow, better than I thought.

153
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,604
No, no!

154
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,806
I shouldn't think about mokkori with a kid!

155
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,140
I must have been frustrated.

156
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,303
I'm going to hurry up and go home,
then get paid for this job.

157
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,350
So long.

158
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,042
Hello, how are you?

159
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,669
Why don't you dry off your clothes like me?

160
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,016
Police?

161
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,317
Oh, this?

162
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,944
You can get it at any toy store.

163
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,055
I'm telling you that I don't have the key now.

164
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,757
The key is at my house.

165
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,917
Oh, no!

166
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,287
How long do I have to walk?!

167
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,835
We have no choice, because
someone destroyed my car.

168
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,737
Why don't you get a cab?!

169
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,006
Don't you feel sorry for a lady?

170
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,476
I'm sorry, but my wallet is also
at the bottom of the sea.

171
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,943
Idiot!

172
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,894
Oh, no, I can't walk any further!

173
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,630
Hey, hey, don't sit down in a place like that.


174
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,000
No, no, no, I don't want to walk any further!

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,467
Jeez...

176
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,844
Oh, a bunch of people!

177
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,646
Those are my friends, the Pirates.

178
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:58,242
But it looks like they don't think
you're their friend anymore.

179
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,278
Get them!

180
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,854
Let's run!

181
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:13,899
Oops!

182
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,534
There they are!

183
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,001
This way!

184
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,039
How many friends do you have anyway?!

185
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,508
All together, probably two or three hundred.

186
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,669
What? That many?!


187
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,573
No, this is a dead end!

188
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,412
Hey, what shall we do?!

189
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,319
Do something!

190
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,562
Idiots!

191
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,029
This is a dead end.

192
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,132
Not here?!

193
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,538
Idiots!

194
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,473
They're in the manhole.

195
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,498
Let's go!

196
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,289
Hurry up! How long does this take?


197
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,991
Hey, get in line! Don't push!

198
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,959
Why is it taking so long?!

199
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,789
Here you go.

200
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,526
We're lucky because they're dumb.

201
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,468
Shall we go?

202
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,636
Ryo's late, isn't he?

203
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,181
I wonder if they found him?

204
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,513
I don't think you need to worry about that.

205
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,544
But who are they anyway? The ones
who've been chasing you?

206
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,882
They're from the Japanese branch
of the Hong Kong mafia.

207
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,719
Why are people like that following you?

208
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:54,600
They're trying to get back something which
Takao, Sakura's brother, made.

209
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,261
What is it?

210
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,237
The original plates for fake US dollars.

211
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,397
Counterfeit money?

212
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,344
Takao is one of the best creators
of originals for printing.

213
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,507
The Hong Kong mafia found out about
him and they threatened him.

214
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,207
They forced him to make the
plates, didn't they?

215
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,788
But Takao escaped with the original
plates while they were off guard.

216
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,950
However, they found him, and...

217
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,123
Takao was in serious condition
but he survived.

218
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:55,494
Now, he's in a local hospital where
they won't be able to reach him.

219
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,662
However...

220
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,730
However?

221
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,000
He told me he'll get his revenge on them
when he gets better.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,067
No way!

223
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,069
An ordinary person is no match
for a criminal organization!

224
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,368
I told him the same thing, but
he said he has the high card.

225
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,606
He means the original plates, doesn't he?

226
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,639
Well, Sakura heard about it and she took
the originals away somewhere.

227
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,184
I think she tried to stop her brother
from getting involved in crime.

228
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,118
But because of that, now...

229
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,389
Sakura is their target now.

230
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,977
Misawa, haven't you found her yet?

231
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,179
I am sorry, Mr. Egami.

232
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,739
She was taken away by a troublesome guy.

233
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,116
Troublesome?

234
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,318
Who did you mean?

235
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,287
Well, City Hunter.

236
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,956
City Hunter?

237
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,390
Damn! What a problem!

238
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,885
But I can't make our headquarters
in Hong Kong wait any longer.

239
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,556
They'd brand us useless.

240
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,902
You know what that means, don't you?

241
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,230
A bloody purge, right?

242
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,609
Not only me, but you too.

243
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,911
No way.

244
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,380
Please take it easy.

245
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:28,053
I passed some weapons to her friends so
those guys will find out where they are.

246
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,688
It's a silly way to get things done.

247
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,155
What the hell?!

248
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,025
Those little flies can't match up
with a guy like him.

249
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:41,265
There's only one person who can
fight him as an equal.

250
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,270
I see. You mean yourself, don't you?

251
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,638
I guess so.

252
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,609
By the way, how long are you going to
stay here like this?

253
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,978
I didn't hire you to give you free drinks.

254
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,157
You have to work.

255
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,602
Hey, when can I fire this?

256
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,205
Jeez, why the hell do they have guns?

257
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,375
It means there's someone who gave
dangerous toys to them.

258
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,743
What do you mean?

259
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,644
I have an idea.

260
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,167
Come with me.

261
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,344
Cabaret Neko Manma #2

262
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,520
Here!

263
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,122
When you're tired, mokkori, I mean...

264
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,646
I should say to have a rest is
the best way to recover.

265
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,427
What the hell do you think you're going
to do at a place like this?

266
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,163
I'm going to charge up my mokkori
power at this place!

267
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,460
Oh, boy!

268
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,437
How gorgeous this young man is!

269
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,807
Wow, these handcuffs are a
new fashion, aren't they?

270
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,799
Yay! Everybody, come on!

271
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,876
What is he thinking?!

272
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,582
Come on! Wow, wow!

273
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,117
Mokkori is now in full power!

274
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,352
What? I'm having so much fun now!

275
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,430
Bathroom!

276
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,536
Sakura, haven't you finished yet?

277
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,094
Don't rush me!

278
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,107
Hey, don't even think about peeping in here!

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,607
I don't want to peep at a kid like you.

280
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,782
Hey, don't you hear some strange noise?

281
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,322
Oh, no!

282
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,383
You shouldn't try to hear something
while a girl is in the bathroom!

283
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,320
I'm so sorry.

284
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,992
I have something I need to do with that toilet.

285
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,272
Sakura, can you let me in?

286
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,007
Hey, what are you talking about?

287
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,474
Please!

288
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,784
Did they run away?

289
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,925
You shouldn't have scratched me so
badly like this, should you?

290
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,628
But you came in there suddenly.

291
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,152
You tried to escape from me anyway.

292
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,055
Damn, how persistent!

293
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,420
This is the end, isn't it?

294
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,387
DO it!

295
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,270
What? Where did they go?

296
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,741
You are a cop just as I thought, aren't you?

297
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,473
Something like that.

298
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,526
This way!

299
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,878
Well, there's no place to escape now.

300
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,048
I want you to run away now.

301
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,016
What the hell?

302
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,359
Here!

303
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,804
Withdraw now!

304
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,523
Finally, it's the end this time.

305
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,557
Incredible!

306
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,059
Hey, hey, can I see that?

307
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,161
Hey, watch out!

308
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,230
Wow, it's pretty heavy.

309
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,164
It's not a toy.

310
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,824
Wow, how cool!

311
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,052
You let down your guard at last.

312
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,519
You've lost.

313
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,989
I want you to come with me now.

314
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:32,914
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

315
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:37,389
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

316
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,120
You skip dinner and eat diet food

317
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:48,259
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

318
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,671
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

319
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,004
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

320
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:03,108
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

321
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:12,187
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

322
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,092
Don't you, don't you know

323
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:20,465
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

324
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:28,304
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

325
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:34,204
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

326
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,418
Oh, my god!

327
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,786
Hiromi has also been kidnapped.

328
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,889
Man, and I finally brought Sakura
home after all that trouble.

329
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,857
I can't get the one mokkori she promised.

330
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,093
Don't you have anything else on
your mind other than that?!

331
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,429
You can't do anything unless you solve
the problem from the source.

332
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,463
Well, I guess so.

333
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,599
Hey, Umibozu, you have to work for me
as your apology for interrupting me!

334
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,401
Don't change the responsibilities.

335
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,836
City Hunter 2:

336
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:02,073
"Mokkori Contract! The Strange Journey
of Ryo & a Bad Girl (Part 2)"

337
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,973
If you miss it, I won't pay you.

338
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:08,034
Please look forward to the next episode
