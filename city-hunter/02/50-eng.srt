1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Mayonaka no lady, hitogomi ni magire

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
Utsurigi na steppin' kurikaeshite iru

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Tsuyogari no face, tough na furi de

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Odori akashite mo

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
Sono hitomi wa kodoku na iro

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
Kakushi kire nai

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, akirame nai de,
kimi no shinjita yume

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, sono omoi o, wasurezu ni ite

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,130
My love is extreme.

14
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,588
That's what she said when she appeared
in front of me and attacked me.

15
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,369
Three other guys also attacked me.

16
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,566
They're the Black Army, a terrorist group.

17
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,241
Black Army?

18
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,043
They set a nuclear bomb in Shinjuku,

19
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,646
and sent a ransom note for a hundred billion
yen to the Japanese government.

20
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,013
But why are they trying to get Rumi?

21
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,284
Ryo!

22
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,521
How quick they are!

23
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,356
I guess they really hate us.

24
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:08,316
Goodbye, Hard-Boiled City
(Part 2)

25
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,731
Listen, walk forward slowly.

26
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,303
No matter what happens, don't look back.

27
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,205
Well, go.

28
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,081
One...

29
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,950
Two...

30
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,552
Three...

31
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,053
Four...

32
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,555
Five...

33
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,923
Six...

34
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,625
Seven...

35
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,092
Eight...

36
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,893
Nine...

37
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,622
And, ten!

38
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,426
Duck!

39
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,040
As I thought, this is all my fault.

40
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,142
Yesterday, as I was thinking about Kazuya,

41
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,654
I was walking the streets of Shinjuku

42
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,054
and I saw it there.

43
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,094
There was a black van parked in front
of the old building

44
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,062
that will be demolished soon.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,737
There were several people wearing
uniforms, just like we saw before.

46
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,797
They were carrying something large
wrapped up in a big sheet.

47
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,809
I got scared

48
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,478
and ran to the main street without thinking.

49
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,142
Now, I think it was...

50
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,583
The nuclear bomb.

51
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,456
Yes!

52
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,448
And the female soldier who appeared
a little while ago...

53
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,992
That was the leader of the
Black Army, Sarah.

54
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,741
My name is Sarah.

55
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,802
I declare on behalf of the Black Army
of the World Revolution Group,

56
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,582
if you refuse to pay us a hundred billion yen,


57
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,016
the nuclear bomb will be detonated
as we planned.

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,446
Wait for our next contact.

59
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,280
What jerks!

60
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,961
Who is it?!

61
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,428
Excuse me.

62
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,565
What the hell?!

63
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,200
This much is for sure.

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,896
They seem to have set the nuclear
bomb in that building.

65
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,102
Oh, my.

66
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,677
Anyway, the first thing to do

67
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,145
is to evacuate people from Shinjuku
and the surrounding areas.

68
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:18,251
Ms. Nogami, please handle this
matter very carefully.

69
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,481
Do not allow the public to know
about the nuclear bomb.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,088
Understood.

71
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,556
Miss!

72
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,759
Well, about my daughter.

73
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,194
Don't worry.

74
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,786
She's safe and sound.

75
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,934
Attention please.

76
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,698
This is an announcement of the
Metropolitan Police Department.

77
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:44,007
We have confirmed that there are currently
unexploded bombs under Shinjuku.

78
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,637
Please evacuate the area
as soon as possible.

79
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,843
Repeat: This is an announcement...

80
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,906
Many unexploded bombs were
found in Shinjuku,

81
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,477
and the surrounding areas
have been sealed.

82
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,105
There is a large-scale evacuation underway.


83
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,287
Unexploded bombs...

84
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,654
If people find out it's a nuclear bomb,
there's going to be a huge panic.

85
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,985
Why don't you evacuate?

86
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,761
Miki is worried about you.

87
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,188
Oh, no, I'm not worried.

88
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,171
Falcon and I want to see Shinjuku empty
of people for once. That's it.

89
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,833
You perverts!

90
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,708
Where did that idea come from?

91
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:56,516
In the middle of the night like this, you
guys want to be alone in Shinjuku,

92
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,484
so you're perverts.

93
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,457
I'm not like you.

94
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,721
That's what he says!

95
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,628
Hey!

96
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,430
Instead of coming up with a
silly idea like that,

97
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,295
why don't you worry about Kaori?!

98
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,805
Found you, just as I thought.

99
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,239
Saeko?

100
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,706
Bad news.

101
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,578
This is a copy of the videotape from
Sarah, and information from the CIA.

102
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,384
According to these, Sarah is just the
name of one of their missions,

103
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,220
and there are no female operatives
by that name.

104
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,488
What do you mean?

105
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:39,322
There's only a person who
thinks she's Sarah.

106
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,527
It's hypnosis.

107
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,565
She's being manipulated by the
real leader through hypnosis.

108
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,769
They use women who have been
trained for special warfare

109
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,296
in the countries where they
engage in terrorism.

110
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,174
Why do they do something like that?

111
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,165
Probably to hide whom the real leader is

112
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,140
from investigators all over the world.

113
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,549
Exactly.

114
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,176
Can I borrow a marker?

115
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,646
This blond is a wig.

116
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,459
Kaori?

117
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,194
Now that you mention it, it does look like her.

118
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,830
Sarah is Kaori.

119
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,465
That's right.

120
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,023
Ryo, did you know that?

121
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,136
Nobody could mistake it, because...

122
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,766
They were definitely Kaori's.

123
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,877
Kaori's Number 32 panty.

124
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,418
Their nickname is Cutie Panda!

125
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,783
What? What the hell?

126
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,460
Listen! They're just terrorists.

127
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,587
Clean them out completely.
Just think of it as training!

128
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,874
Is it a nuclear bomb?

129
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,854
Thank you for the exercise.

130
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:49,889
What?!

131
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,187
If you continue to resist uselessly,

132
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,354
we might move up the explosion time
for the nuclear bomb.

133
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,797
We are not afraid of death.

134
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,265
Hurry up and prepare a hundred billion yen.

135
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,776
Well, first of all, we need to eat.

136
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,948
Ryo...

137
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,221
Someone is approaching us.

138
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,260
Personnel from the Japanese government?

139
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,804
I don't know,

140
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,295
but it looks like they're highly trained.

141
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:47,606
I see.

142
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,841
Sarah?
I see.

143
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,068
Sarah?


144
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,775
Can you hear me, Sarah?

145
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,613
The situation has changed.

146
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,911
The mission needs to be accelerated.

147
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,585
I'm sending a message to the
Japanese government.

148
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,018
Yes, Ma'am.

149
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,105
The next time they contact you,

150
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,869
please stretch the conversation
as long as possible.

151
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,241
As I already told you, someone with
a radio is manipulating Sarah.

152
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,014
We need to find out where that person is.


153
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,886
But if we provoke them, they
might do something.

154
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:38,050
They will use Sarah to detonate the
nuclear bomb if they have no choice.

155
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,949
Oh, no!

156
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,157
The previous data proves it.

157
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,367
I told you to stop your useless
struggling, didn't I?

158
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,196
What? What are you talking about?

159
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,336
Withdraw the people who are
currently attacking us,

160
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,177
or I will detonate the nuclear bomb
in ten minutes.

161
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,683
Wait! What do you mean by that?

162
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,082
I hope you understand.

163
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,991
Who?

164
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,458
Who is it?

165
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,951
Who is currently attacking?

166
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,226
We've confirmed the source of the signals!

167
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,411
Ryo, from this point on, it's your job.

168
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,410
That's it. That cruiser!

169
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:56,322
Kill him! Murder that man! Sarah!

170
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,333
Kaori!

171
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,869
Don't you understand? I'm Ryo!

172
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,336
Ryo Saeba!

173
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,598
Stop! I don't want to shoot you!

174
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,552
My name is Ryo Saeba

175
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:34,726
Cleaning up bugs who live in the city,
that's what I do for a living

176
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,528
My weapon is a Colt Python .357 Magnum

177
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,306
Wake up.
The only thing I can't bring myself
to shoot is the heart of a beauty

178
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,275
You, your name is Kaori!
The only thing I can't bring myself
to shoot is the heart of a beauty

179
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,643
The hot piece of lead that shakes the muzzle
is a one-hole-shot that brings down evil

180
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,146
What's wrong, Sarah?! Kill him!
The hot piece of lead that shakes the muzzle
is a one-hole-shot that brings down evil

181
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,647
Kill him!
The hot piece of lead that shakes the muzzle
is a one-hole-shot that brings down evil

182
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,048
The hot piece of lead that shakes the muzzle
is a one-hole-shot that brings down evil

183
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,280
Someone who's already crossed me once
is quiet the second time in Hell

184
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,913
That's the way I do business

185
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:06,357
Someone told me that blood, gun smoke,
and the fragrance of roses suit me

186
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,134
I am a sweeper of the city

187
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,398
People call me City Hunter!

188
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,417
Sarah, can you hear me, Sarah?!

189
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,954
Listen to what I say very carefully!

190
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,891
Switch on the nuclear bomb. Right now!

191
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,893
What's the matter? Can't you obey my order?!

192
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,987
Sarah, switch on the nuclear bomb!

193
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,040
The game is over.

194
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,919
It's too late.

195
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,922
She already turned the switch on.

196
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,412
Oh, my God...

197
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:22,001
In five minutes, the city of Tokyo
will be a dead town.

198
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,420
I wonder if I could...

199
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,638
Red or white?

200
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,050
It's okay, so shoot me.

201
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,725
If you can't go back to being yourself,

202
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,461
there's no meaning to life for me.

203
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,503
The man who makes you cry,

204
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,130
is now missing you.

205
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,731
I...

206
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,042
My tires bite into the asphalt

207
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,533
As I slice through the darkness

208
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,316
I risk my life on cheap thrills

209
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,841
Yes still I fear what tomorrow might bring


210
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,624
It's your pain or my pain or somebody's pain

211
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,194
If there's someone to live for

212
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,664
It's your dream or my dream
or somebody's dream

213
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:31,125
There's nothing I'm afraid of

214
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,973
Get wild and tough

215
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:40,412
I can't solve love's puzzle alone

216
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,247
Get wild and tough


217
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:47,719
There's no place for weakness in this town

218
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,555
Get chance and luck

219
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:54,960
Somewhere, there's got to be something
only you can protect

220
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,795
Get chance and luck

221
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:02,427
You can go back and fix
those broken dreams

222
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,816
Thank you for everything.

223
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,650
Finally, my dad understood us.

224
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,656
He approved our marriage.

225
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,325
Wow! That's good!

226
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,792
Yes!

227
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,418
By the way, Ms. Kaori?

228
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,730
Don't you remember anything that
happened while you were Sarah?

229
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,336
Oh, really?

230
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,141
But...

231
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,300
Ryo...

232
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,615
I'm pretty sure that...

233
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,082
Sure of what?

234
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,722
Oh, nothing. Nothing important.

235
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,638
Hey, Ryo!

236
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,374
Umibozu, Saeko, and Miki
are here to see you.

237
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,841
Ryo!

238
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,402
Ryo's not here?

239
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,482
No, I'm pretty sure that he didn't
go far since his leg is injured.

240
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,353
Hey, girl with mokkori hips!

241
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,724
Hey, do you have some free time?

242
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,463
What a shy girl!

243
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,437
Excuse me, lady, wow!

244
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,304
Wait a sec, please!

245
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,969
Ryo, I can't believe you!

246
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,051
Eat this! My 101-ton Kaori's Special Hammer!

247
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,293
Oh, Mr. Saeba.

248
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,902
Guitar o kikase ta katta

249
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,599
Ai o todoke ta katta

250
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,500
Omoi ga tsutae rare na katta

251
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:37,011
Boku ga sumu kono machi o,
kimi wa nani mo shiranai

252
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:43,417
Boku ga koko ni iru wake sae mo

253
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:58,343
Moshi, ano toki ga, furui renga no machi
nami ni somaru kotoga dekite itara

254
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,710
Kimi o hanasa na katta

255
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,985
Fuyu no hizashi o ukeru kouen o yoko gitte

256
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:16,227
Mainichi no seikatsu ga hajimaru

257
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:26,503
Toki ga tomatta mama no boku no kokoro o

258
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:32,843
Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

259
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,544
I go to the house of psychics
Reika shows me.

260
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,558
While the old lady is talking,
I remember various things,

261
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,995
and I realize that I always put Ryo in danger.

262
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,530
As the old lady said,

263
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,567
I might be a messenger from Hell,
guiding Ryo to death.

264
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,402
It might be better to disappear
than to be around him.

265
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,804
City Hunter 2:

266
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,073
"Crystal Prophecy!
Chains of Memory Reviving in Kaori"

267
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,802
If you miss it, I'll be depressed!

268
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,435
Please look forward to the next episode
