Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

13
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:42,869
How many nights to sleep before Christmas?

14
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,804
Don't be an airhead, Ryo.

15
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,372
Kusunoki House is in danger.

16
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,308
Ookouchi is about to take away the land.

17
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,876
No, I'm busy.

18
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,845
This time, why don't you deal
with it by yourself?

19
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,880
Fine! I won't ask you for anything any more.

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,145
I can go by myself and get the certificate
of ownership for the land.

21
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,519
Now, Keiko has been kidnapped?

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,751
You can help me a little bit, can't you, Ryo?

23
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:07,861
To Kaori From Ryo,
With Love at Christmas
(Part 2)

24
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,762
Kusunoki
House

25
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,260
Oh, no...

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,174
Ms. Kaori, Mr. Saeba...

27
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,574
I've heard that Keiko was kidnapped.
Is that true?

28
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,650
Ms. Kaori, is there a pocketbook
with a black leather cover

29
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,948
among the documents that you stole
from Ookouchi's house?

30
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,616
They're demanding that I return it to them.

31
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,258
A pocketbook with a black leather cover?

32
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,885
Not the certificate of ownership for the land?

33
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,362
No...

34
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,854
They desperately want to get
the pocketbook.

35
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,067
That's why they took Keiko.

36
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,870
Kaori, what the hell did you steal?

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,839
I don't know either.

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,864
I was in a hurry.

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,945
Ms. Kaori, if we can't find the pocketbook,
I don't know what will happen to Keiko.

40
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,176
The other documents are in the
main hall of the temple.

41
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,915
There's no such thing! No pocketbook
with a black leather cover!

42
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,888
No way!

43
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,378
Look for it more carefully!

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,521
But look.

45
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,955
What shall I do?

46
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,899
I guess there is no other way to
rescue Keiko except by force.

47
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,773
That's right.

48
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,509
In this situation, I will fight against
them to the bitter end!

49
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,476
No way!

50
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,943
No matter what you're thinking, don't do it.

51
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,248
There's no way to fight against him.

52
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,984
Nobody can oppose him.

53
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:42,088
Mr. Hitoyoshi, they took Keiko as a hostage.

54
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,657
It's better to defeat them utterly.

55
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,147
She's right, Mr. Hitoyoshi.

56
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,457
These are bad guys so we
should finish them.

57
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,132
Yuriko, what are you saying now?

58
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:58,071
Even if they are bad guys, that's no
justification for us to do bad things.

59
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,006
First of all, why did you steal
something like this?

60
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,645
Mr. Hitoyoshi, that's too cruel to Ms. Kaori.

61
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,347
Ms. Kaori didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,838
She did it because of us.

63
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,346
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,656
What I did was not necessary.

65
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,158
Ms. Kaori!

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,564
Where the hell did Kaori go?

67
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,371
Saeko?

68
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,833
I have something to tell you, Ryo.

69
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,102
Do you have some time?

70
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,972
I said I don't know, so I don't know!

71
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,983
Don't lie.

72
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,719
It's not working. I know that
you hid the pocketbook!

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,085
I said I don't know anything about it.

74
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,924
If you tell me the truth,
I won't get mad at you.

75
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,593
Don't you care about Keiko?

76
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,528
I said, I don't know about it.

77
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,257
Don't lie to me!

78
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,070
I heard you.

79
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,398
Well, Kenta, I won't get mad at you so
you can tell me the truth, can't you?

80
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,644
Kenta!

81
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,779
Wait, Kenta!

82
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,905
Kenta!

83
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,084
Where is Keiko? Is Keiko okay?

84
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,881
Keiko is fine, isn't she?

85
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,724
You're a gentle teacher.

86
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,887
You don't have any intention
of hurting children.

87
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,825
But the people here, many of them
are difficult for me to control.

88
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,828
If you don't hurry up and bring it, I can't
guarantee what will happen to her.

89
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,199
I can't find the pocketbook!

90
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,076
Don't be ridiculous.

91
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:48,247
You're telling me that, but you better
not ever betray Mr. Ookouchi!

92
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,783
It's true. I really can't find it!

93
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,352
Stop kidding around!

94
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,388
If you can't find it, I don't care
what happens to her.

95
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,489
No way!

96
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,558
We will wait for an hour from now.

97
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,293
You have to find it before then.

98
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,022
Please wait...

99
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,276
That is...

100
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,477
The black leather pocketbook.

101
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,375
Kenta found it.

102
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,582
Kenta, good job!

103
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,147
Well, give it to me now.

104
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,757
What's wrong, Kenta?

105
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,559
No, I won't give this to you.

106
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,194
What are you talking about?

107
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,797
You don't care if Keiko doesn't
come back, do you?

108
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,267
If you give it to me, Keiko
will come back soon.

109
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,368
It's a lie!

110
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,971
I know that, if you go return this
to them, it won't work.

111
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,274
I'm gonna take this to them and
I'm gonna rescue Keiko.

112
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,642
Kenta...

113
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,873
Because you've been defeated
by them every time.

114
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,614
But...

115
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:59,285
You're always telling me that you
shouldn't give in to your dark side.

116
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,912
Don't be a wimp.

117
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:11,497
Mr. Hitoyoshi, I'm really sorry about Keiko,
because I created the situation.

118
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,301
But why can't you oppose Ookouchi?

119
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:18,668
Please tell me why is he taking
advantage of you?

120
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,582
It's been quite a long time since we've
gone out driving like this, Saeko.

121
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,884
Well, which hotel do you want to go to?

122
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,653
Don't misunderstand me.

123
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,644
I only want to get some information from you.

124
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,388
We can exchange information
in the hotel, can't we?

125
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,494
What a troublesome baby you are!

126
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,560
What the hell is this?!

127
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,902
It's interesting, isn't it?

128
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,233
No, it's not interesting.

129
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,040
Actually, I have a favor for you.

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,609
I want to get the document Kaori
stole from Ookouchi.

131
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,612
Is this the proper way to ask for a favor?

132
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,614
I have something to ask you too.

133
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,715
What?

134
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,117
What's the relationship between
Ookouchi and Hitoyoshi.

135
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,984
How does Ookouchi take advantage
of Hitoyoshi's weakness?

136
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,082
Oh, that thing.

137
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,325
It's an old story.

138
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,486
It happened right after the end of WW2.

139
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:25,164
It happened a long time ago, after Japan lost
WW2, and people in Japan were poor.

140
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,940
Houses were burned down, and
there was no food at that time.

141
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,782
There were lots of poor orphans.

142
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,517
I decided I wanted to build an orphanage
and collect those kids.

143
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:52,425
I grew up without knowing my parents, and
when I was little, it was very tough for me.

144
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,562
But in order to build an orphanage,
I needed lots of money.

145
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,763
That's when I met Ookouchi.

146
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,034
I was asked to work for him to make bombs.

147
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,579
He told me that battleships that sank during
the war were blocking the port

148
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,248
and other ships couldn't get through.


149
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,977
In order to get rid of them,
he needed bombs.

150
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,420
During the war, I was working
in bomb manufacturing,

151
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,089
so I accepted the job with gratitude.

152
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,693
But at that time, I didn't know what
kind of person Ookouchi was.

153
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,196
I also didn't know that he used the bombs
not for the sunken battleships,

154
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,596
but for cargo ships.

155
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,305
Ookouchi stole the food or clothes from the
cargo ships, and sank the empty ships.

156
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,468
He made it seem like an accident,
and sank them.

157
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,173
I found out the truth later and I was so upset.

158
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,415
The bombs you made were great.

159
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,883
You're a great partner of mine.

160
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:51,852
Lots of innocent people had problems
because of the bombs that I made.

161
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:58,092
I was a part of Ookouchi's crime even though
I didn't know about it at the time.

162
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,469
I should be disqualified to be called teacher.

163
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,936
I am a criminal.

164
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,178
I understand.

165
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,404
But why does Ookouchi have the certificate?

166
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,553
Three years ago, I desperately needed
the money to keep this place,

167
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,316
and asked him to help me.

168
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,224
At that time, I deposited the
certificate with him.

169
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,460
Ookouchi promised me that
he wouldn't do anything

170
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,485
which would put his old friend into trouble.

171
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,398
I was an idiot.

172
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,368
I thought that since this orphanage
was built by dirty money,

173
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,632
I couldn't help it if he took over.

174
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,374
Post-war, which is over forty years ago.

175
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:46,112
During those years, you have
raised lots of orphans.

176
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,280
You've already paid for your crime.

177
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,273
And also, if this place disappears,
what are those kids going to do?

178
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,977
I almost forgot the important things.

179
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,257
The first priority is to protect these kids,

180
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,418
rather than caring about my stupid past.

181
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,198
Kenta, please.

182
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,928
Would you please give the
pocketbook to me?

183
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,698
Kenta...

184
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,209
Thank you.

185
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,215
This is...

186
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,876
What's the matter?

187
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,254
This is Ookouchi's second ledger.

188
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,855
Second ledger?

189
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,191
I've heard people spreading
rumors about him,

190
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,193
like bribing politicians, or evading taxes.


191
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,660
The evidence of all those things is in here?!

192
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,951
I know you are very busy, so I
appreciate you coming here.

193
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,588
Why the hell do I have to come
to a place like this?

194
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:07,423
Well, Hitoyoshi wants to give the
pocketbook directly to you.

195
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,062
Hurry up and let me go home!

196
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,495
Shut up!

197
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,299
Ouch!

198
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,934
What the hell are you doing there?

199
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,302
That's enough! Take her somewhere.

200
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,803
Yes, Sir.

201
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,939
I think you already know.

202
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,703
I don't know anything about this incident.

203
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,410
Of course.

204
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,613
I won't leave any trace of your
having been here.

205
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,848
Then fine.

206
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,316
What's the current situation regarding
Kusunoki House?

207
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,586
I already took care of it.

208
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,419
The bulldozer will arrive after Hitoyoshi
leaves there to come here.

209
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,759
You are very smart.

210
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,920
Thank you.

211
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,966
Ookouchi, come out here!

212
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,196
I brought the pocketbook with me here.

213
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,528
Oh, boy, Miss Thief is here.

214
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:58,333
You have a very good woman as
your helper, Mr. Hitoyoshi.

215
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,513
What are you talking about, Ookouchi?!

216
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,743
You, hurry up and return Keiko to me.

217
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,251
The pocketbook first.

218
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,185
Keiko should be first.

219
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,421
Hey!

220
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,849
Yes, Sir.

221
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,255
Now, the pocketbook is first.

222
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,899
Where is Keiko?

223
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,036
Don't be in a hurry.

224
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,697
I'll let you meet her soon.

225
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,499
Now!

226
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,503
Sorry, but we decided to let you
meet each other in Hell.

227
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:39,885
We will send Keiko right after you
so relax and wait for her.

228
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,986
What the hell?

229
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,112
You cheated us!

230
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,957
In this, the real world, the person who
was cheated is the wrong one.

231
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,430
Who are you?!

232
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:05,311
I'm sorry, but I would like both of you
to go to Hell, not them.

233
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,911
Ryo!

234
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:06,679
Keiko!

235
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,714
You jerk, when did you...

236
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,272
Well, what are you going to do now?

237
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,086
You can withdraw quietly
with the pocketbook,

238
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,146
or all of you can go to Hell together?

239
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,790
Ryo Saeba...

240
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,594
You won, young man. Right, Kazama?

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,172
However, Hitoyoshi, I'm worried
about Kusunoki House.

242
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,470
That was an old building.

243
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:41,046
It's easy to destroy it, but it would
cost money if you had to rebuild it.

244
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,513
Lots of money.

245
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,150
What the hell?!

246
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,619
At this moment, the House is...

247
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,921
Now, how about making a deal?

248
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,825
Then, I might help you financially,
to rebuild the House.

249
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,159
Impossible...

250
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,956
You sent your people to attack
the House, didn't you?

251
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,290
Die!

252
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,394
Idiot!

253
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:12,009
This time I'm so mad!

254
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:12,845
Wow!

255
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,607
Oh, no!

256
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,090
Ookouchi! Be prepared!

257
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,466
What the hell are you doing?!

258
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,567
Why don't you fire?!

259
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,057
Yes, Sir!

260
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,473
You were mean to innocent children!

261
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,175
I'll never, ever forgive you guys!

262
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
She's being very showy this time.

263
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,550
Well, I think it's okay.

264
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,230
Damn!

265
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,833
Now, now,

266
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,569
you shouldn't interrupt an
interesting show like this.

267
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,504
Yes, of course, I'm going to enjoy the show.

268
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,938
Jerks!

269
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,233
Sir, hurry up!

270
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:06,581
Damn, they'll pay for this.

271
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,599
I've been waiting for you, Mr. Ookouchi.

272
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:34,119
I've been investigating the crimes of
Ookouchi for a long time.

273
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,646
Because of Kaori, I was able to grasp
the evidence faster than I expected.

274
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,418
Detective...

275
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,933
Mr. Hitoyoshi!

276
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,400
I...

277
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,605
Mr. Hitoyoshi, a police officer
doesn't have enough time

278
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,608
to investigate a crime which
happened decades ago.

279
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,168
That's why we have the statute
of limitations in the law.

280
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,018
Mr. Hitoyoshi, we have to hurry and
go back to Kusunoki House.

281
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:06,852
Ryo!

282
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,319
Let's go!

283
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,994
Hurry!

284
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,639
Please, please let us make it!

285
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,563
Holy cow.

286
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,571
Ryo, can we have a Christmas party
tomorrow at our place?

287
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,817
Well, after stuff like this happens,
how can I say no?

288
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,185
Really?!

289
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,653
Everybody, don't worry.

290
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,257
This middle-aged man will be Santa
and rebuild this place.

291
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,282
What? Really? Santa will make a new house?

292
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,161
Our rooms too?

293
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,795
I would like to have a five story house.

294
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,063
Are you sure?

295
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,997
Yes, really!

296
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,302
Kaori...

297
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,271
You can earn money.

298
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,939
Work harder.

299
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,207
Right?

300
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,232
I guess so, but...

301
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,404
Here, a present for you.

302
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,005
Wow, thank you.

303
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,173
Here, Kenta.

304
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:08,840
Thank you.

305
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,808
Wow, interesting!

306
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,346
Hey, everybody, the cake is ready.

307
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,548
Wow, incredible! Looks delicious! How big!

308
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,083
I get this Santa decoration.

309
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,551
I get the red one!

310
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,586
I'm taking lots of icing.

311
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,053
The sponge cake is mine!

312
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,723
Here you go.

313
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,623
Let's eat!

314
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,533
Ms. Kaori, I'm really sorry.

315
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,371
Because I was not strong enough,
you had to take care of everything.

316
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,819
Oh, no, Mr. Hitoyoshi.

317
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,016
Ryo and I just like to see the
smiles on the kids' faces.

318
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,458
Teacher, play a game with us!

319
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,226
Oh, sure.

320
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,561
Hurry up!

321
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,028
Oh, how about this?

322
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:18,266
Ryo, thank you for giving them
a great Christmas.

323
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:25,110
I heard from Saeko that you were watching
me to let me be independent this time.

324
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,654
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,112
I don't think I'm mature enough to be
independent for a while yet.

326
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,192
Not at all.

327
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:38,253
As I thought, you are the best
partner for me, Kaori.

328
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,600
Ryo...

329
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,334
Oh, snow.

330
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,171
No wonder it's so cold.

331
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,946
Damn!

332
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:59,508
I thought about presents for the children
and I forgot to buy a present for you!

333
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,357
That's okay.

334
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,795
Ryo, what you just said...

335
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,854
It's enough for me.

336
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,231
It's the best Christmas present for me.

337
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,234
It's the best Christmas present for me.
Guitar o kikase ta katta

Hey, Umibozu is getting married!

350
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,656
Wow, sexy man! No, I can't say that!


351
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,825
I won't approve of him getting married
to a beautiful woman like her!

352
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,460
If you're frustrated about it, win the bet.

353
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,828
But she's an ex-mercenary, you know.

354
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,164
I won't lose! I will take Miki away from him!

355
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,866
Well, whatever you say.
I will help her, though.

356
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,700
Traitor!

357
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,468
Beeee!

358
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,736
City Hunter 2:

359
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,506
"Umi-chan, What a Sexy Guy!
Beautiful Sweeper Miki Gets Close (Part 1)"

360
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,303
If you miss it, I'm going to get close to you!

361
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,468
Please look forward to the next episode
