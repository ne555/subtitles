00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:15,815
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

2
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:25,247
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:33,561
Mayonaka no lady, hitogomi ni magire

00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:41,165
Utsurigi na steppin' kurikaeshite iru

5
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:46,146
Tsuyogari no face, tough na furi de

6
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,478
Odori akashite mo

00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,453
Sono hitomi wa kodoku na iro

Oh, Sarah, akirame nai de,

Oh, Sarah, sono omoi o, wasurezu ni ite

00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:19,446
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

12
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:29,412
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,864
Rosemary Moon - her other name
is Bloody Mary.

14
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,832
She is a professional sweeper.

15
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,037
When I was in the US a long time ago,
I used to work with her as a partner.

16
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,372
What? Your partner?

17
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,542
Yes, I know everything about Ryo.

18
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,177
Everything.

19
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,080
I feel miserable.

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,084
I thought I'd been his partner for a long
time, but Ryo didn't tell me anything.

21
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,387
Ryo didn't tell Mary anything about his past.

22
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:06,025
The man who was Ryo's first partner
was in the guerrilla war with Ryo.

23
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,362
He taught Ryo everything about how
to fight and also trained Ryo.

24
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,465
And also, he is Mary's father.

25
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,435
Then, Mary heard the story from her father!

26
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:20,429
Good Luck, My Sweeper
City Streets For Both of Us
(Part 2)

27
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,113
What's the matter?

28
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,593
You look like you lost your soul.

29
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,560
Kaori?

30
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,670
What the hell, all of a sudden?!

31
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,843
Finally, I feel good. You made me so mad.

32
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,471
You didn't tell me anything about such
important things at all. Me,  your partner!

33
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,917
Of course, it's difficult for me to accept
the story that you have lived as

34
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,754
a guerrilla in a war, But your pain,
like losing your parents,

35
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,989
or that you don't have any idea
when your birthday is...

36
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,822
Those things, I can understand.

37
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,328
So, I will help you heal a little.

38
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:22,790
I'm going to give you a birthday.
Your birthday is March 26th, Ryo.

39
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,837
You are thirty years old.

40
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,876
From now on, I will celebrate your birthday
every year in place of your parents.

41
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,644
You have to appreciate me.

42
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,780
Wait, wait a sec.

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,949
Why March 26th?

44
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,052
And I don't want to be thirty years old.
At least, keep my age in the 20s.

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,522
You're a man, so stop complaining
about the small details.

46
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,719
Anyway, my pleasure to
work with you, partner.

47
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,394
Then I'm going to show you my appreciation
for giving me a birthday.

48
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,411
Thank you, partner.

49
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,428
She is diligent, and a strong woman.

50
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:31,393
But why March 26th? Is there any reason?

51
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,799
Well, it's not a big deal.

52
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:41,206
Except, it's the day when I met
Kaori for the first time.

53
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,567
99.5... Your fever is finally going down.

54
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,879
Thank you, Miki.

55
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,549
Anyway, why did you stay for an hour on
the roof in the middle of the night?

56
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,052
On top of that, it was raining, so
of course you caught cold.

57
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,888
Where are Ryo and Mary?

58
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,322
They went out somewhere together.

59
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:31,764
Ryo took the chance because I got sick,
so he went out on a date with Mary!

60
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,734
I don't have time to be in bed like this!

61
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,703
No! If you overdo it now,
your fever will come back.

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,137
You're still sick.

63
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,581
That hammer, was it that heavy?

64
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,883
Of course. It weighs 100 tons.

65
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,182
Also, probably Saeba is showing
her around the town, I think.

66
00:05:55,188 --> 00:06:02,492
I guess. I'm pretty sure that he thinks
I'm the most important and...

67
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,809
Oh, my God! You turned totally red. You
moved too much so your fever is back.

68
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,412
Oh, no, this is not because of fever.

69
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,381
Oh, my, it's 107.6!
You have to have strict bed rest!

70
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,854
Look at her!
What the hell is he?!

71
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,378
Damn!

72
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,125
People look at me with jealousy.

73
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,585
I can't help it, because you are a top model
in the outside world, Mary.

74
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,636
Hey, Ryo, I don't like to see ordinary places.
Please show me something rare.

75
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,104
Of course!

76
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,237
Private Room Café
SHOWA

77
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,542
What is this place?

78
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,703
A rare café with private rooms.

79
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,479
What is this for?


80
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,108
You will see it when we get in.
Well, ladies first.

81
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,522
Oh, just a café with private rooms.

82
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,992
Oh, no, not only that.

83
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,450
I'm going to teach you what this place is.

84
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,629
I'm going to check my makeup.
I will be right back so wait here.

85
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,441
Damn, well, I don't need to hurry, I guess.

86
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,609
When she comes back here, put her
down on the sofa and...

87
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,169
Mary!

88
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,783
What the hell?!

89
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,250
Grenade?!

90
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,519
Ryo!

91
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,489
Oh, my god.

92
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:57,043
Who the hell did that when I
was about to have fun?!

93
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,944
Hey, Ryo, I'm thirsty after
the disturbance there.

94
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,174
Why don't we go to an
ordinary café this time?

95
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,360
Why don't you smoke once in a while?

96
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,829
Thanks, but this place is no smoking.

97
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:55,799
A heat sensor auto focus gun? Who the
hell set a thing like that here?

98
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,666
What is he?
He's got a gun!
Call 911!

99
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,441
Candid
Camera
Hello, this is Candid Camera!

100
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,411
Candid
Camera
Hello, this is Candid Camera!

101
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,380
Candid
Camera
What?
Oh, really?!

102
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,780
Oh, really?!

103
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,182
See, there is a camera in the
building across the street!

104
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,412
Oh, really? Oh, no...

105
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,630
The grenade and then an auto focus gun...

106
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,258
I think someone is trying to kill me.

107
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,003
Hey, Ryo, the carp in Japan are a mystery.

108
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,494
They're eating this. Look.

109
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,175
What? Fried chicken?

110
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,303
No way. Carp don't eat meat, do they?

111
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,780
Mary, help me!

112
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,723
Ryo!

113
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,827
Help me!

114
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,801
Ryo...

115
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,943
Ryo?

116
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,317
Ryo, are you all right?

117
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,615
I was almost eaten by them.

118
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,390
What strange carp they are anyway!

119
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,392
They're piranha!

120
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,761
I didn't know there were piranha in Japan.

121
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,596
Of course NOT!

122
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,564
Hotel
Ophelia

123
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,334
Good timing. Let's go in here.

124
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,768
Wait, wait a sec. Do you know
what kind of place this is?

125
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:43,273
Of course, I would like to warm your
wet body up with my own.

126
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,277
I can't believe it.

127
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,745
It is actually happening to me,
just like my dream.

128
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,017
Take off your wet clothes and
put on the bathrobe.

129
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,315
I'm going to take a shower.

130
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,433
Please forgive me, Ryo.

131
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,817
By the way, Mary, what is your real
purpose for coming to Japan?

132
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,717
You didn't come here to do
this with me, did you?

133
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,781
Well, why don't you join me now?

134
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,028
If you come in here, I'll tell you.

135
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,655
Sure, no problem!

136
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,204
I came here to kill you.

137
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:54,105
That's exactly what I thought. But why?

138
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,210
I will follow you to tell you that,
so wait for me in Hell.

139
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,993
What's wrong, Kaori?!

140
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,962
Strange! I feel something bad.

141
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,795
Ryo...

142
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,848
You don't seem like yourself, Mary.

143
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,509
You shouldn't be tricked by this.

144
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,087
A mirror?

145
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,379
She tried to kill you?

146
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,156
I had a hard time.

147
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,286
She set traps in advance in the
places where I might go.

148
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,196
I see... At last, you were shot
while you were fooling around

149
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,323
in the hotel where she asked you
to go with her, weren't you?

150
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,902
Thank you for your stinging words, Kaori.

151
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:27,339
But still I can't believe it. Why does she
want to kill you, her former partner?

152
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,576
At least, it's not because of
a grudge against me.

153
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,544
Probably, somebody made her.

154
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,129
What's the matter? Why don't you shoot me?

155
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,972
You are awake just as I thought.

156
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,174
Why don't you fight back against me?

157
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,042
It's too obvious. I can't kill
a beautiful woman.

158
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,650
It's okay. Shoot me.

159
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,882
It's not bad, I guess, if I'm killed
by you, my former partner.

160
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,058
However, I want to know the reason,

161
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,687
as your final respect for me,
as your former partner.

162
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:04,092
If I kill you, someone's life will be saved.

163
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,905
Someone?

164
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,566
Your current partner?

165
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,879
Yes, but he's a partner in the ordinary world.

166
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,847
His name is Eric.

167
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:32,197
Without him, I couldn't have become
the model, Rosemary Moon.

168
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,495
His management made it come true.

169
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,604
He's the person who found
another face in me

170
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,606
who had been living in a
dark underground world,

171
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,200
and he guided me to the bright sunlight.

172
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:49,014
With him, I can live in the bright sunlight.

173
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,884
I can get out of the dark
underground world.

174
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,852
That's what I thought.

175
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:05,531
Your important manager has been
kidnapped, hasn't he?

176
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,500
If you want to get him back,
they told you to kill me.

177
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:15,407
I wonder who in the hell did that? But I
guess there are thousands of people

178
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,376
who have a grudge to bear against me.

179
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,727
No, I don't know.

180
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,693
As soon as we arrived at the airport,
he was suddenly taken away from me.

181
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:48,433
I couldn't even see their faces.

182
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,270
There is no other way to
save him except this.

183
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,968
No, I can't. I can't do this.

184
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,096
So, I came up with another idea.

185
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,573
Mary!

186
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,699
Don't stop me.

187
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:28,680
If I do this, they have to give up
and release him,

188
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,480
and I won't have to kill you.

189
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,310
Stop, Mary!

190
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,456
Umibozu!

191
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,969
What good timing!

192
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,938
It was too close, wasn't it?

193
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,650
Mary, you could have told us this earlier.

194
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,586
But nobody could have done anything
anyway if I told you before.

195
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,721
It's a bad habit of people in
the underground business.

196
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,588
You can't trust me even though
I'm your former partner.

197
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:17,788
If you had told me about this, we could
have gone to see him sooner.

198
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:25,337
I thought something was wrong with you so
I asked Umibozu to do some work.

199
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,239
He got the information and came here.

200
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,237
I can take you to the place
you want to go right now.

201
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,176
Falcon...

202
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,691
There's a hotel under construction here that
was cancelled due to financial problems.

203
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,394
There's no money to demolish it,
so the building was left as it is.

204
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,632
I see. This is a good place to hide
without being seen by anybody.

205
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,033
The man who kidnapped him is David Clive.

206
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:02,508
He used to be chief of the Intelligence
Agency of the Duchy of Munceto.

207
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,843
David Clive...

208
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,311
He used to be called the terrorist from Hell.

209
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,077
David Clive?

210
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,646
Who is that man, Ryo?

211
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,588
I don't know.

212
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,560
What are you talking about?
When we worked together,

213
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,063
we totally destroyed his intelligence agency
while on a mission, didn't we?

214
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,431
Is that so?

215
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,169
Because of that, Clive was deported
from his country.

216
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,404
Of course he bears a grudge against us.

217
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,873
Well, anyway, his character is dark.

218
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,606
He has kept his old grudge for years and
he tries to make us kill each other.

219
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,220
Nothing to laugh about, is there?

220
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,023
Well, we know something,
so let's go, Umibozu.

221
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,192
Why do I have to go?

222
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,595
Are you trying to run away now,
you bald skinhead?!

223
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,063
What? You made me get involved with this!

224
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,668
Wait! Give me some time.

225
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,037
What do you need now?

226
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,005
We have to hurry.

227
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,497
I know that, but please...

228
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,118
Well, we can't help it if she says so.

229
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,245
What's wrong with her?

230
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,617
I think she's in pain.

231
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,573
It's impossible for me, to hope
for normal happiness.

232
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:46,374
Just as I thought, it's not for me.

233
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,256
Why is Mary taking so long?!

234
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:02,626
Well, she might be changing her underwear
because she is about to see her lover.

235
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,202
What the hell are you doing?

236
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,178
Oh, Umibozu, did you also come to peek
into the room and see Mary changing?

237
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,078
What the hell!

238
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,508
Let's do this together.

239
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,448
Don't think I'm the same as you are!

240
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,722
Damn! He doesn't know how much
power he needs to use.

241
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,191
What?!

242
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:55,213
I am so sorry, Ryo, but I don't want
to cause you any more trouble.

243
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:59,785
I will rescue him by myself, even if I have
to exchange my life for his.

244
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:07,317
No, I think my life should end so that I don't
cause any more trouble for him.

245
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,693
I can't be with him anyway.

246
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,302
Guitar o kikase ta katta

247
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,999
Ai o todoke ta katta

248
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,901

Boku ga sumu kono machi o,

Boku ga koko ni iru wake sae mo

251
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:58,744
Moshi, ano toki ga, furui renga no machi

252
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,111

Fuyu no hizashi o ukeru kouen o yoko gitte

254
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:16,627
Mainichi no seikatsu ga hajimaru

Toki ga tomatta mama no boku no kokoro o

256

Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

257
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,420
You went with Mary, Kaori?!

258
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,089
Because Mary intends to die!
I can't let her go alone!

259
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,592
But Eric has been taken as a hostage.
We can't do anything.

260
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,695
But why do you need to shoot each other
just because the suspect tells you to do so?

261
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,864
Hold the gun, Mary! Aim at me!

262
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:57,502
Mary, if you want to rescue your important
partner, please do whatever Ryo says now!

263
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,638
City Hunter 2, the final episode:

264
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:03,341
"Good Luck, My Sweeper -
City Streets for Both of Us (Part 3)"

265
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,865
If you miss it, we won't be able
to see you again!

266
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,878
Please look forward to the next episode
