1
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,351
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,919
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:40,407
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,673
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,475
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,413
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,728
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,461
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,664
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,136
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:28,847
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,271
Not a chance.

13
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,406
No matter what I say?

14
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,307
Right.

15
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,708
Why me?

16
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,210
Why do I have to accept a request

17
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,645
to be a shooting coach for an
Olympic athlete candidate?


18
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,781
To support the Japanese team!

19
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,248
I'll have nothing to do with it.

20
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,453
Ryo, don't you want to work for our country?

21
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,920
Nope!

22
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,957
Nothing I can do, I guess.

23
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,430
I thought she would be your type too.

24
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,066
Wait, Saeko! What did you say just now?

25
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,235
The person I want you to coach

26
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,568
is a beautiful female police officer,
but I can't force you.

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,940
Wait, Saeko!

28
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,077
If you go back to your office without
good news, you'll be disgraced, right?

29
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,578
I have no choice in that case!

30
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:30,072
I, Ryo Saeba, will work for our country.

31
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,981
DEVOTE MYSELF

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,814
Wow, great! I owe you big time!

33
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:41,983
Aim for the Gold Medal!!
Intimate Training for the Shooting Beauty

34
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,131
What the hell were you thinking?!

35
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,766
Why are you so mad?

36
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,468
Who left this house saying,

37
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,996
"No matter how horribly we need a job,
I won't accept any request from Saeko?!"

38
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,278
Listen, Kaori, even if it's a request
from Saeko, a job is a job.

39
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,512
Also...

40
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,848
Since this is a most critical
situation for the nation,

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,651
nobody could accept the request
except me, right?

42
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,653
On top of that, the Olympics
is the sport festival

43
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,988
at which all countries on Earth
can come together,

44
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,422
overcoming borders, races and mokkori!

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,397
What?

46
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,034
You were tricked by Ms. Saeko, again!

47
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,934
The person you're supposed to
coach must be a man!

48
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,362
No way! Saeko told me that she's a
beautiful female police officer, and...

49
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,109
You are a very honest man, aren't you?

50
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,942
It's one of my attractive characteristics.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,643
Don't you mean mental defects?

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,057
When using the gun for the games, the
distance is twenty-five meters.

53
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,758
There are two kinds, quick shoot
and slow shoot.

54
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,628
Quick shoot is five shots in three seconds,


55
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,364
and slow shoot is five shots in six minutes.


56
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,700
It would be so easy for you, Ryo, right?

57
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,496
What?

58
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,869
Where did he go?

59
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:57,665
What?

60
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,997
What are you doing?!

61
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,776
Your butt is not in a good
position when you fire.

62
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,945
If you do exactly what I say from now on,

63
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,214
you will be the star of the Seoul Olympics.

64
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,116
Well, like this, extend your arms and...

65
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,847
Stop it. This place is off limits for civilians.

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,658
Don't fight!

67
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,558
How did you get in here?

68
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,589
There is no border for mokkori!

69
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,567
I'll ask you again. How did you get in here?

70
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,494
You don't have a sense of humor, do you?

71
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,169
Oh, Detective Nogami!

72
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,875
Did that man do something wrong?

73
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,910
It's all right. You don't need to tell me.

74
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,978
I think I know.

75
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,283
Well, can you let him go? He's with me.

76
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,051
With you, Detective Nogami?

77
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:45,852
Yes, she's right.

78
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,549
He is a little weak on morality,
but he doesn't intend to...

79
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,224
I'm sorry!

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,595
You're kind of violent!

81
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,196
Ryo, let me introduce her.

82
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,632
This is Officer Kurahashi.
You are going to coach her.

83
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,363
What? Where, where?

84
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,342
Yes, that's her.

85
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,809
She has a good personality.

86
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,943
Mokkori

87
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,486
Yes, this job sure looks enjoyable,
doesn't it? Oh, yes!

88
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,518
Detective Nogami, I don't need a
coach for special training.

89
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,797
Officer Kurahashi, why do you refuse?

90
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,534
I'm not the only candidate
for the Olympic games.

91
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,832
I don't like being treated
like a special person.

92
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,671
She's absolutely right!

93
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,072
Saeko, you should respect what she said.

94
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:46,245
Ms. Seiko, you are a great officer,
and I don't think it's necessary

95
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,112
for you to have an irresponsible
coach like me.

96
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,651
Well, I had better get going.

97
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,778
Oh, please don't say goodbye.

98
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,358
Where are you going?

99
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,993
Oh, see, I just thought I don't
need to work on this request

100
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,120
since you hated it so much, so...

101
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:08,134
Who said that even though it's a request
from Ms. Saeko, a job is a job?

102
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,365
Oh, I'm impressed by you remembering
such things so well.

103
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,075
Officer Kurahashi, this is an order.

104
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,635
No matter how you feel, you have to obey.

105
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,770
Yes, Ma'am. I understand.

106
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,852
Well, Ryo, I'll leave the rest to you.

107
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,321
Wait a minute, Saeko!

108
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,481
Hey, Ryo!

109
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,927
What are you planning by
pushing her on me?

110
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,021
I don't have any plans, but let's say...

111
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,624
If she's not chosen to be an Olympic
athlete, it will be me.

112
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,305
That's not the reason, is it?

113
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,740
I don't like being showy, so please, Ryo.


114
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,482
Is that so?

115
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,056
Incredible!

116
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,798
Well, that's the way.

117
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,823
I understand. I'll try it.

118
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,601
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

119
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,012
Sir, how was I?

120
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,494
Well, can't your form be a little more
ordinary when you shoot?

121
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,691
Excuse me, but it's the best way
for Kurahashi to shoot.

122
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,632
I have an idea, Coach!

123
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,234
Why don't you go with me to the movies?

124
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,531
You too, Ms. Kaori?

125
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,538
Go where?

126
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,505
Dirty Harry 4

127
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,944
This is it. This movie is being shown
at this theater as a revival.

128
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,505
Kurahashi learned my way of
shooting from Dirty Harry.

129
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,318
What's the matter, Ms. Seiko?

130
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,687
You just littered, didn't you?

131
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,889
You can't become mature adults
if you do that.

132
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,356
Pick it up!

133
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,826
Can't you see that sign?

134
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,728
No stopping and no parking in this area!

135
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,562
Even though she's off duty, she's still
so faithful to her job!

136
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,003
Well, now, forget your job for
a second and let's go eat?

137
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,345
Sir, Kurahashi is a police officer,
so Kurahashi wants to do my...

138
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,381
Excuse me, but stop calling
yourself by your last name.

139
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,009
I call myself by my last name.
What's so wrong with it?

140
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,289
Watch out! Get down!

141
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,636
What happened to the window?

142
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,365
I heard a gunshot or something.

143
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,811
Damn!

144
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,319
I guess he's gone.

145
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,188
Are you all right, Ms. Seiko?

146
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,757
Yes, Sir.

147
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,520
What happened?

148
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,531
Oh, my god! Are you really Ms. Seiko?

149
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,366
Yes!

150
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,469
What's the matter, Sir?

151
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,836
Ms. Seiko, why do you hide it?

152
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,375
Ryo, are you all right?

153
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,544
Someone shot at Ms. Seiko with a rifle.

154
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,171
Contact Saeko and find out what's going on!

155
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,849
Saeko? Me?

156
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,651
Hurry up! Go!

157
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,948
Yes, Sir.

158
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,854
Kaori is gone.

159
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,152
Coach?!

160
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,062
The gun you have...

161
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,360
Oh, this? Well...

162
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,935
You're a police officer as I thought.

163
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,197
Excuse me, but what is your position?

164
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,003
Superintendent or something
like that, I guess.

165
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,409
I apologize for my lack of consideration.

166
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,113
Detective Nogami told me
that you were a civilian.

167
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,138
No, don't worry about it.

168
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,951
Now, please instruct me on
how to investigate

169
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,612
the shooting incident that just happened.

170
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,022
Instruction number one.

171
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,624
Take off your glasses!

172
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,091
What?

173
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:31,823
Optical Shop Kazushin

174
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:37,603
Well, how is changing from glasses to
contact lenses related to the investigation?

175
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,641
If something happens, and you drop your
glasses, the suspect will run away.

176
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,042
Oh, I see.

177
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,110
Well, let's go on.

178
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,077
Oh, coach!

179
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,015
Well, next one, next one!

180
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,658
Ms. Seiko, do you understand?

181
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,592
This is your true figure.

182
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,857
What do you mean by true figure?

183
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,561
Don't you feel anything when
you look at yourself now?

184
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,966
Isn't it a little overdone
for a sting operation?

185
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,277
Someone tried to shoot them with a rifle?

186
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,047
Yes, he said the target was Ms. Seiko.

187
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,381
I see.

188
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,542
If someone fired at her with a rifle,

189
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,453
the cause might be the incident
from four years ago.

190
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,155
Incident from four years ago?

191
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,613
Yes, she shot a bank robber.

192
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,425
The suspect had been firing at random
from inside the bank.

193
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,092
She jumped out from the barricade when
the shooting paused for a second.

194
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,441
Blood! Blood! Blood on my face!

195
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,353
Help me! She's a murderer!

196
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,945
She's going to kill me! Please don't kill me!

197
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,787
If the robber, Mimura, has
been released from jail...

198
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,236
Yes, who is it?

199
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,805
Excuse me, but I came to collect money.

200
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,272
Collect money?

201
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,535
Excuse me, but did I buy
something at your shop?

202
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes, please pay for contact lenses.

203
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,816
A hair cut, a perm and a facial.

204
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,252
Mr. Saeba bought the most
expensive dress at my store.

205
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,321
Ryo did?!

206
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,509
Well, please have just one glass with me.

207
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,245
Is this a part of the investigation?

208
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,772
Yes, I will tell you the reason later,
so have a drink.

209
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:08,218
Understood, since it is your order,
Seiko Kurahashi will challenge...

210
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,191
Seiko Kurahashi, here goes!

211
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,238
Ah, all that at once...

212
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,146
I didn't know alcohol could be this good.

213
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,415
Can I have one more glass?

214
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,578
I guess. I'm afraid that this story
might follow a familiar pattern.

215
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,239
I want to dance with you very closely.

216
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,675
If you don't mind, I would like
to be your partner.

217
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,404
Really?!

218
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,510
What the hell are you doing in
a place like this?

219
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,648
Kaori?!

220
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,683
Ryo...

221
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,241
Saeko!

222
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,151
Oh, Detective Nogami!

223
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,924
Is this really Ms. Seiko?

224
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,893
Yes, this is definitely Ms. Seiko.

225
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,028
What have you done to her?

226
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,563
I haven't done anything yet.

227
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,359
Ryo...

228
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,729
What the hell are these invoices?

229
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,769
Necessary expenses for the investigation.

230
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,536
What's the connection between dressing
her up and target practice?

231
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,043
Wow, she is good!

232
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,850
Thank you, I am in the best
of moods right now!

233
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,731
Is that really Ms. Seiko?

234
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,867
Saeko, does she become like that
every time she drinks?

235
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,665
I don't know. This is the first time
I've seen her like that.

236
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,577
I am so sorry I got drunk last night.

237
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,774
I... No, Kurahashi regrets very much...

238
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,718
I told you, you shouldn't
call yourself Kurahashi.

239
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,084
You should be more confident
about yourself.

240
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,455
Yes, Sir.

241
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:28,894
Ms. Saeko told me that you have good
shooting skills, but your aim is a little off.

242
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,397
She also told me that it might be
because of your personality.

243
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,667
Yes, not only does Kaori have bad aim,
but there is also her personality.

244
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,192
Compared to her, Ms. Seiko
has lots of potential.

245
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,771
I am not good at shooting, as you said.

246
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,710
But I truly understand what
Detective Nogami said.

247
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,079
I've kind of felt that way myself.

248
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,481
I think that's why she asked
Ryo to teach you,

249
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,550
but then things like last night happen.

250
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,010
No, because of the party last night,
I feel like my eyes have been opened.

251
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,079
I feel so...

252
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,989
Finally, I will make you pay
for the cut on my cheek.

253
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,903
Ms. Seiko, we are going to complete
the final part of your training.

254
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,304
After this session, your training
will be complete.

255
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,119
Where are we going?

256
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,327
This is...

257
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,727
As you see, this is the shooting range.

258
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,561
Why did you turn off the lights?

259
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,507
Concentration is required for shooting.

260
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,135
In other words, eyes in your mind.

261
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,543
In order to grow them, darkness is
the best environment.

262
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,075
Well, shoot this target.

263
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,179
I can't shoot with you standing there.

264
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,285
If you have eyes in your mind,
you won't see me.

265
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,388
But if I hit you...

266
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,690
I don't care. Do it!

267
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,955
No, I can't.

268
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,127
Just as I thought.

269
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:46,065
Your lack of concentration is caused
not only by your personality,

270
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,033
but you also have some
problems, don't you?

271
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,601
I almost killed a person.

272
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,937
Are you talking about the bank robber?

273
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:58,966
Yes, I was aiming at his arm, but...

274
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,887
Blood! Blood! Blood on my face!

275
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,750
My aim was off, but luckily the
bullet just grazed his face.

276
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,861
However, it could have killed the suspect.

277
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,833
When I think like that,
I can't shoot at people.

278
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,735
But as a police officer, sometimes
it is necessary to do so.

279
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,837
You finally got here.

280
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,487
Long time no see.

281
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,488
You?!

282
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:46,592
Thank you for having humiliated
me that time.

283
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,891
Now, I'm going to make you feel
the same fear I felt back then.

284
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,729
That was...

285
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,531
Bastard!

286
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,266
Why you!

287
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,538
Now then, give me your gun.

288
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,952
Coach...

289
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,886
Hey, don't shoot!

290
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,924
There is no guarantee whether
he's gonna live or not,

291
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,789
you cute police officer, you.

292
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:27,397
I've been looking forward to this day
while I was in jail.

293
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,894
Now, drop your gun!

294
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,408
Don't! Aim at his right shoulder!

295
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,035
Then he won't be able to fire his rifle!

296
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,344
Shut up! Don't say stupid things like that.

297
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,819
Who dares interfere?!

298
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,054
Now! Fire, Ms. Seiko!

299
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,357
You, bastard! I'm gonna kill you!

300
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,428
It hurts!

301
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,677
Call an ambulance, please. I'm going to die!

302
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,406
Please help me!

303
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,814
The bullet just grazed his shoulder!
His story is so exaggerated.

304
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,619
That was a great job, Ms. Seiko.

305
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,878
Now, I don't have anything more
to teach you.

306
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,157
Coach...

307
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,285
No, Mr. Saeba, I wanted to protect you.

308
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,858
Thank goodness you're all right.

309
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,103
Oh, well.

310
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,266
Just this once, I'll pretend
I don't see anything.

311
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,848
Why are all of you here?

312
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,685
You're leaving, so we all
came to see you off.

313
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,192
Good luck!

314
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,693
Take it easy!

315
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,660
Good job!

316
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,131
Yes, I, Seiko Kurahashi, will do my best!

317
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,326
Hey, hey, don't call yourself
by your full name.

318
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,498
Oh, that's right.

319
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,671
Yes, just like that.

320
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,173
Oh, Ms. Seiko, it's about time.

321
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:20,702
Yes, Ms. Kaori, Mr. Saeba and
Detective Nogami, I'm going now.

322
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,948
I know you can get a gold medal.

323
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,283
Don't lose your sense of calm.

324
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,084
Take care of yourself.

325
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,551
I will!

326
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,197
Thank you very much.

327
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,893
I will do my best.

328
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:47,439
And when I come back, I will
go to see Mr. Saeba first,

329
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,407
with a gold medal in my hand.

330
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,516
Ms. Seiko will get the gold medal, won't she?

331
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,525
Well, I don't know.

332
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,827
She will.

333
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,658
Oh, you believe in her that much?

334
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:17,265
Because she promised me she'll get it.

335
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:33,215
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

336
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,689
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

337
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,420
You skip dinner and eat diet food

338
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,559
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

339
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,971
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

340
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:56,304
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

341
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:03,409
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

342
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:12,487
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

343
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,393
Don't you, don't you know

344
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:20,766
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

345
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:28,605
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

346
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:34,504
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

347
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,053
They say Ryo Saeba is a Superman,
who protects the city's justice.

348
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,223
That's my reporter cameraman!
Yoko's sure got a sharp eye.

349
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:49,127
Don't be so happy! If your face becomes
public, it'll be over for our business.

350
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,896
How about we say that I'm his kid brother?
