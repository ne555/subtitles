1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:16,049
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:25,481
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,795
Lady in the middle of the night,
blended in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:41,399
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,379
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,711
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,686
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,985
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:05,031
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:12,072
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:19,679
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:29,645
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,084
You've lost your skill, haven't you?

14
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,210
You think so?

15
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,454
Even?

16
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,726
You love to play dangerous games
like this, as usual, Robert.

17
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,785
It's been five years, Ryo.

18
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:48,356
So Long, My Friend
The Last Shot Echoing in My Heart
(Part 1)

19
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,109
When did you get to Japan?

20
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,644
I just got here.

21
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,306
I want you to be my tour guide in Japan.

22
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,550
I don't mind doing so.

23
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,518
However, I have to work starting tomorrow.

24
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,821
Work?

25
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,456
Yes...

26
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,326
It's an important job so I can't
excuse myself from it.

27
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,763
Since when have you taken
work so seriously?

28
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,731
Don't say things like that.
I've done so for a long time.

29
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,196
You idiot! It's dangerous!

30
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,737
Confess! A cutie, isn't she?

31
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,406
I don't know.

32
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,840
Cute or not, it's all up to
your subjective view.

33
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,244
Bar Sleep Alone

34
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,341
This is...

35
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,920
You know her?

36
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,888
Princess Angela of the Felidan Kingdom.

37
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,227
I thought her father, the king,
had passed away.

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,429
She holds the fate of the country
in her hands, doesn't she?

39
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,498
She is coming to Japan secretly.

40
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,767
You're going to be her bodyguard?

41
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,035
Yes!

42
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,772
Her purpose in coming to Japan
is not sightseeing.

43
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,900
Her purpose is to meet the leaders of
the guerrilla forces for peace talks.

44
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,708
The Felidan Kingdom has been destabilized
for ten years because of the civil war.

45
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,416
The government of the country could be
overthrown at any time.

46
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,286
She wants to regain peace for her country

47
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,720
and chose Japan as the place
for peace talks.

48
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,617
But there are some who don't want peace.

49
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,361
So you're going to protect her
from them, aren't you?

50
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,828
Exactly.

51
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,864
This job is dangerous because
we don't know

52
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,526
when the radical members of the
guerrilla forces will attack her.

53
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,737
Why don't we work together
after such a long time?

54
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,739
I'll share the reward fifty-fifty.

55
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,740
What's the matter?

56
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,836
Well, I came to Japan just to have fun.

57
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,146
That's an unexpected answer.

58
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,478
I know you don't care about anything
if you can get a beautiful woman.

59
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,884
Well, I won't force you to.

60
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,219
Well, why not?!

61
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,087
She's such a cutie and I can't let you
handle this case by yourself

62
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,088
because you're such a pervert.

63
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:53,218
Look who's talking?! You Oedipus
and Lolita complex pervert!

64
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,429
What did you call me? Take it back!

65
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,798
No way! What part of me
did you call a pervert?

66
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,892
Shut up! Your face, your attitude, your
whole body shows you're a pervert!

67
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,469
Interesting!

68
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,232
You want to fight?

69
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,973
Excellent!

70
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,838
Let's finish this!

71
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,776
Kabuki-Cho 1st Street

72
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,183
Cabaret Neko Man'ma

73
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,257
Did you see how attractive I was there?

74
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,350
I won!

75
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,762
What the hell are you talking about!
I was more attractive than you were!

76
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,595
Look at my angels who became
my love slaves!

77
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,134
Stop kidding around! Look at these girls.

78
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:40,340
Mokkori Mika, mokkori Yuu, and there is
mokkori Kazu and mokkori Megu, and, and...

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,308
You haven't changed a bit.

80
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,242
What?

81
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,506
You can't describe a woman without
using the work mokkori!

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,514
Do you want to complain about
my expression of my love?

83
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,515
Disgraceful!

84
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,917
What the hell?!

85
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,252
Do you think "love slave" is a graceful way
of describing a woman?

86
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,555
At least, it's literary.

87
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,191
You can't talk big like that when
you dump girls instantly.

88
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,126
I don't dump them. I say goodbye to them.

89
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,991
Yes, goodbye!

90
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,697
Thank you for your business today.

91
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,394
What? I thought we would all go
together to do mokkori!

92
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,635
Bye.

93
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,770
It was fun.

94
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,038
See you again.

95
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,337
Oh, Mika, Yuu, Kazu and Megu!

96
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,340
The end of money is the end of
the relationship, isn't it?

97
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,312
Indeed, this is the economic animal, Japan.

98
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:38,162
Look up at the sky and walk so
tears don't fall...

99
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,500
Kaori, open up!

100
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,832
Stop your useless resistance and come out!

101
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,706
What time do you think it is?!

102
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,765
We have go to work early in
the morning tomorrow!

103
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,777
Hello.

104
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,577
A guest?

105
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,980
Yes, this is my old friend, Robert.

106
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,248
Well, come in, come in.

107
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,113
Excuse me, Miss.

108
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,342
He called me "Miss."

109
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:07,727
You were with Ryo five years ago in LA,
when the plutonium was stolen?

110
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,857
Yes, the FBI couldn't do anything about it
and they asked us to handle the case.

111
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,568
I know Ryo so I'm sure that he caused
trouble for you, didn't he?

112
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,803
Not really.

113
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,431
The reason that case was solved
was because he was there.

114
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:27,068
Anyway, I was surprised to find a charming
lady like you is Ryo's partner.

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,149
Oh, no. Charming?

116
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,785
But a professional wouldn't
tell a lie, would he?

117
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,821
No, his eyesight is getting worse, I guess.

118
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,391
Because he calls a woman charming,
who hits me all the time with a hammer.

119
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,258
That's because you try to do mokkori
no matter where you are!

120
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,963
Get down, Kaori!

121
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,895
Before the contract takes effect,
what a showy warning it was!

122
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,863
I guess they're serious about it.

123
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,757
I rely on you, my partner.

124
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,430
Tokyo International Airport

125
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,917
I'm sick. I drank too much.

126
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,553
Pull yourself together. You're going to
meet the Princess, aren't you?

127
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,988
I'll be all right.

128
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,957
When I see the Princess's face, a silly
hangover like this will disappear.

129
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,694
He's hopeless.

130
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,734
Off Limits to
Ordinary Passengers
VIP ROOM

131
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,000
Come in.

132
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,211
Ten minutes late.

133
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,045
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,842
The traffic congestion in Japan
is worse than I expected.

135
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,118
Robert Harrison?

136
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:12,952
Hello.

137
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,442
He's my partner this time.

138
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,688
Wow, what a surprise?!

139
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,851
Nice to meet you, General Marukido.

140
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,532
Yes, I've heard a rumor that you are the
number one sweeper in the US.

141
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,068
I'm relieved to hear that you're on the team.

142
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,572
By the way, Mr. Saeba,
what's wrong with you?

143
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,564
Sorry, I drank too much last night.

144
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,111
Damn...

145
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,147
If the Princess wasn't the person
who recommended you,

146
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,705
I would make you go home.

147
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,151
Anyway, the contract is in effect now.

148
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,225
Until the time of the peace talks tomorrow,
I leave her safety to you guys.

149
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,692
Please take care of her.

150
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,728
Trust me.

151
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,855
Set your mind at ease...

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,368
Damn!

153
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,603
I'm going to get the Princess.

154
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,797
Wait here.

155
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,342
Ryo, cut it out!

156
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,310
I don't like a face like his.

157
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,085
This is dangerous work, but I hope
you will look after me.

158
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,552
I am Robert Harrison.

159
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,949
I am Ryo Saeba. My pleasure to meet...

160
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,027
Not you.

161
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,729
Oh, no, why?!

162
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,496
You're going to puke.

163
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,697
No, I won't.

164
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,398
No!

165
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,501
No way would I be rude to
a princess like that.

166
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:40,906
If I can't kiss her, at least please let me
touch her beautiful hand.

167
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,466
Then I'm sure that I will feel better.

168
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,346
Your Highness, can I really trust him?

169
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,583
I think you should have some military
personnel to protect you.

170
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,484
No!

171
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,180
If I did so, the peace talks
would not be possible.

172
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,722
The condition is to meet with
the representative

173
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,020
of the People's Liberation
Organization secretly.

174
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,487
As well as Robert, I've heard that Mr. Saeba
is also the best of the professionals.

175
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,591
Exactly, you can trust me!

176
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,341
You can trust him, but he's dangerous.

177
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,308
Please watch out.

178
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,004
I guess so.

179
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,180
Now, I'm going to get the car ready for you.

180
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,855
Grenade!

181
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,020
Off Limits

182
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,898
Robert, bring the car here!

183
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,865
Sure!

184
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,404
Mr. Saeba, why here?

185
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,599
There is no place for them to hide.

186
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,350
Your Highness, please hurry up
and get in the car!

187
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,490
Get in, Ryo!

188
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,792
Get in!

189
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,360
Yes!

190
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,193
Your Highness, this car is
safer than that one.

191
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,133
Your Highness!

192
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,434
Get in.

193
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,527
What? Not me!

194
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,545
Stop the car.

195
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,036
If they attack this car, it will be
smashed instantly!

196
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,424
Stop! I said stop!

197
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,654
I'm General Marukido!

198
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,058
Stop!

199
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,334
Damn!

200
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,497
How could you be so ridiculous, you guys?!

201
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,849
Consulate General of the Felidan Kingdom

202
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,122
General, I will hide somewhere with these
guys until the time of the meeting.

203
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,558
Your Highness, it's too dangerous!

204
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:49,085
The safest place in Tokyo is the
Consulate General Office here.

205
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,930
No, I've already made up my mind.

206
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,730
But...

207
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,500
Tomorrow, I will go to the
meeting place directly.

208
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,768
Well, please go now.

209
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,803
Well, General, she says so.

210
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,270
See you tomorrow.

211
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,430
Your Highness!

212
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,812
Damn!

213
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,889
What a beautiful view!

214
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,424
I am sorry, but we don't know when
the assassin is aiming at you.

215
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,300
Oh, you're right.

216
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,133
But I wish I could see the great view.

217
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:37,402
Tokyo, this is a great city compared
with my home country.

218
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,712
In my country, everything is
ruined by the war.

219
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,218
The streets have been destroyed,
and modernization is behind.

220
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,982
The people have been poor forever.

221
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,417
My father had been hoping for
peace for a long time.

222
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,152
But he suddenly passed away
in the middle of his plan.

223
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,302
I don't understand why there are people
who want to continue the war.

224
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,829
I don't understand why there are people
who want people to be poor forever!

225
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,708
A thorn in your side?

226
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,110
Why?

227
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,013
No, nothing like that.

228
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,214
Is that so?

229
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,983
If the people who want to
kill you are guerrillas,

230
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,119
the Consulate General should be
the safest place.

231
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,188
On top of that, you refused to have your
military personnel protect you and hired us.

232
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,655
Exactly.

233
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,960
The only people you can trust are us, right?

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,589
Hey, Robert, I told you to watch
the area around here!

235
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,766
There's no one acting suspicious.

236
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,702
I realized that I left the most dangerous
person in the room.

237
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,638
What do you mean?

238
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,868
People say I'm a cool gentleman.

239
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,902
Then why did you take off your pants?

240
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,246
What? My belt must have
been cut or something!

241
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,122
You are beautiful, Princess Angela.

242
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,919
You look so beautiful when you smile.

243
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,126
Hey, don't steal my line!

244
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,763
Smiles bring you happiness.

245
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,563
If you don't forget to smile, I'm sure
the negotiations will succeed.

246
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,336
Yes!

247
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,571
Well, we have to wake up early tomorrow.

248
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,907
We'll stay up all night on guard
for you tonight.

249
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,408
Please be at ease and sleep well.

250
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,467
Yes, thank you very much.

251
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,382
How long are you going to play
the part of being a good boy?

252
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,450
Calm down.

253
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,442
Mr. Saeba and Mr. Robert, goodnight.

254
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,992
What a beautiful princess Angela is!

255
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,289
Pervert.

256
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,136
Currently, my followers are searching
hotels in the city.

257
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,704
Find her no matter what you do.

258
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,873
I'm pretty sure they'll find her
before morning.

259
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:52,311
If you can't kill her before the meetings,
you may use the final plan.

260
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,573
Understood.

261
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,817
The meeting place is a mountain villa
in the Oku-tama area.

262
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,487
I wonder why they chose a place in
the middle of the mountains?

263
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,231
Learn the directions by heart.

264
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,426
I'm relying on you for the mission today.

265
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,202
Trust me.

266
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,740
I'll take the princess to the villa safely,
exactly as the contract says.

267
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,275
Then sign this paper.

268
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,843
What's this?

269
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,247
Europeans and Americans use a contract
for everything, I've heard.

270
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,182
Anyway, while I'm gone, you promise
not to touch the princess.

271
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,051
Mokkori Prohibited Contract
Anyway, while I'm gone, you promise
not to touch the princess.

272
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,575
Mokkori Prohibited Contract
This is the Mokkori Prohibited Contract!

273
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,823
Excuse me, but please trust me!

274
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,058
Trust!

275
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,159
No, I can't!

276
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,494
First of all, you made this plan.

277
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,664
I can easily see what you're thinking,
trying to separate me and the princess.

278
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,832
Stop kidding around.

279
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,630
My type is just like Kaori!

280
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,164
Did you say something interesting?

281
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,474
Good morning.

282
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,941
What's the matter, both of you?

283
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,709
I prepared and came here.

284
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,180
What is this?

285
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,214
It's nothing, Kaori!

286
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,316
Mokkori Prohibited Contract?

287
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,517
What the hell is this?

288
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,786
This is nothing, right?

289
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:08,912
Yes, he's right.

290
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,689
Miss Kaori!

291
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,790
Yes!

292
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,693
This mission is all up to you.

293
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,462
Please don't overdo anything.

294
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,963
Yes!

295
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,453
Please be careful, Mr. Robert.

296
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,936
Looks like we've got common interests.

297
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,268
We're the best partners ever.

298
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,501
What's wrong with these guys?

299
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,192
Just as I thought.

300
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,662
They already discovered this place.

301
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,789
Take care of Kaori, Ryo!

302
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,566
You too.

303
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,466
Protect her and take the princess
to the villa safely.

304
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,052
Those two! Don't let them go!

305
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,054
Damn! Let's go!

306
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,377
We did it!

307
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,901
We got them!

308
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,384
Hey, hey, Ryo, did I look like the princess?

309
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,875
Yes, because your face was hidden.

310
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,548
My face is not graceful like hers.

311
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,894
Your Highness, please hurry up.

312
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,096
Do you think those two will be all right?

313
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,831
You don't need to worry about them.

314
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,062
Rather than worrying about them, I worry
a little about the enemy's life.

315
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,461
Oh...

316
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,875
Well, how do I stop them?

317
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,109
Let me handle them.

318
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,312
When did you get something like that?!

319
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,014
I'll clean them up by myself.

320
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,641
Hey, they'll discover the trick.

321
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,295
That one doesn't look like the Princess.

322
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,664
Damn, she was a decoy.

323
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,632
I don't care. I'm gonna get them anyway.

324
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,735
What a disgraceful position!

325
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,303
I'm so sorry.

326
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,601
Why don't you hurry up and beat
the hell out of them now?

327
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,873
I guess so.

328
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,365
Now, tell me honestly.

329
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,832
Who is your client?

330
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,435
Guerrillas in Felidan.

331
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,464
I said honestly, didn't I?

332
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,177
I understand. I understand,
so please don't shoot me.

333
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,737
The client is the general, General Marukido.

334
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,582
Just as I thought.

335
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,884
Then the villa is dangerous too, isn't it?

336
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,253
One more question for you.

337
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,256
Tell me the plan for after the
princess arrives at the villa.

338
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,518
Honestly!

339
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:37,951
The general intends to blow up the
whole villa if the plan fails.

340
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:38,897
What?!

341
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,194
Oh, no!

342
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,024
The Villa Petticoat

343
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,913
I guess my followers have failed.

344
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,782
Well, stuff happens.

345
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,250
But if we kill her here, the result
will be the same.

346
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,327
Please let me get there on time.

347
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,954
Not too late, please!

348
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:32,881
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

349
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,356
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

350
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,087
You skip dinner and eat diet food

351
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:48,225
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

352
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,637
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

353
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,970
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

354
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:03,075
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

355
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:12,154
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

356
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,059
Don't you, don't you know

357

Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

358
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:28,271
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

The mountain cottage was blown to pieces.

Is the princess okay?

362
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,923
She's fine, but Robert was in the cottage.

363
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,158
We didn't make it.

364
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,058
Oh, no...

365
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,560
I can't believe that Robert is dead.

366
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,128
I owe him.

367
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,898
Robert, I'll avenge you.

368
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,033
Ryo, let me join you!

369
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,435
I can't forgive Marukido.
