1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:15,815
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:25,247
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:33,561
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:41,165
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:46,146
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,478
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,453
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,752
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:04,798
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:11,838
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:19,446
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:29,412
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,896
Birthday party?

14
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,465
Yes, for me and...

15
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,666
For me too.

16
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,837
What? Miki and Kasumi, you both
have the same birthday?

17
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,538
Yes, what a coincidence, isn't it?

18
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm twenty years old now.

19
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,971
I'm twenty...

20
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,345
Well, never mind.

21
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,615
Tonight, we're having a party here so
please come, both you and Ryo.

22
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,776
Sure, my pleasure.

23
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,789
So, stay available tonight, Ryo!

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,924
Hey, Ryo, are you listening to me?

25
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,093
How nice...

26
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:10,563
In the shower of sunlight in the early
summer, people's eyes will be nailed to you!

27
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,966
Look at this deep cut design in the back.

28
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,369
My eyes are nailed to her!

29
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,005
Wow!

30
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:19,869
Hey!

31
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,175
Why don't you listen to me while
I'm talking to you?!

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,147
Idiot! Don't put something strange in front
of me while I'm resting my eyes!

33
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,613
Something strange?! Idiot!

34
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,455
Next, this beautiful model, who is
famous for her backside beauty,

35
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,290
has just confirmed she is
scheduled to visit Japan.

36
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,793
Her name is Rosemary Moon,
twenty-four years old.

37
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,597
She will be in Japan next month
on a promotional visit.

38
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:49,557
Wow, Rosemary! What a nice name!
We have her picture. Make sure to watch.

39
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,533
Great! I can see her face!

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,970
For the first time on TV,
this is her true face!

41
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,011
Ms. Rosemary Moon
(24)

42
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,643
What?

43
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,086
Bloody Mary...

44
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,681
She's the backside beauty?!

45
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,891
Good Luck, My Sweeper
City Streets for Both of Us
(Part 1)

46
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,856
Hey, why are you hurrying like that?

47
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,369
I can't believe that she's coming to Japan.
I have to hide from her.

48
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,572
Hey, where are you going?
Tell me the reason why!

49
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,269
I don't have time to explain.
See you in a month. Take care.

50
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,349
What? Rosemary Moon?

51
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,755
Hi, Ryo. Where are you going
in such a hurry?

52
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,386
I guess it's too late...

53
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,573
Former assistant of Ryo?

54
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,564
Well, something like that.

55
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:08,281
No way, I don't think a beautiful lady
like you could be his assistant.

56
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,116
Isn't that so, Ryo?

57
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:15,748
When I was in the US, we used to work as
a pair, just for a short while though.

58
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:22,056
She is a professional sweeper, very
famous in the underground world.

59
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,496
Professional sweeper...

60
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,767
Anyway, I can't believe you are a
professional model now.

61
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,802
It's my job in the ordinary world.

62
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,071
I can't support myself just by
doing my underground job,

63
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,040
so I am using my youth and my beauty.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,099
Youth and beauty?

65
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,806
Who the hell is twenty-four years old?

66
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,485
I saw you on TV, but I think your butt
is lower than it used to be.

67
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,649
Look who's talking! Your mokkori is
getting senile I guess!

68
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,122
Don't think I'm the same as you.

69
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,626
Well...

70
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,531
You're working as Ryo's assistant now?

71
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,759
Well, yes.

72
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,508
Jeez, you're a rank amateur, aren't you?

73
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,044
Ryo, you have changed, haven't you?

74
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,347
What are you thinking to have a person
like her as your assistant?

75
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,441
Also, how much does she know
about you, Ryo?

76
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,186
How much do I know?

77
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,555
When Ryo faced the enemy,

78
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,726
I had to know how he would act or how
else was I supposed to support him?

79
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,394
It's impossible for you to do so.

80
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:32,265
And I, I know everything about him.

81
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,529
I mean, everything.

82
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,341
Mary, you were supposed to come to
Japan next month, weren't you?

83
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,741
Why did you come so early, and
why did you come here?

84
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,349
By the way, Ryo...

85
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,952
Why did you try to go out a little
while ago in such a hurry?

86
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,621
You were trying to escape from me and
break the promise, weren't you?

87
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,250
We're engaged, aren't we?

88
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,989
Stop fooling around. You said so without
asking me. I don't think we...

89
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:06,965
What?!

90
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,272
I forgot about it a long time ago.

91
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,609
This time, I came here early for sightseeing.

92
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,145
I want you to be my tour guide.

93
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,948
Also, if I stay here, I can
save money on a hotel.

94
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,050
Don't decide things like that by yourself!

95
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,954
What's wrong? We have such an
intimate relationship, don't we?

96
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,479
Oh, no, help me!

97
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,766
Hello, I have another extra with me.
Is it okay?

98
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,633
Sure, the more the merrier.

99
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,073
Falcon!

100
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,568
Bloody Mary?!

101
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,107
Ryo?

102
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,074
Put your gun up. We're under
a truce for now.

103
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,189
I can't imagine this, based on
the Ryo I knew.

104
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,164
Kaori, who is that woman? She's beautiful.

105
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,292
Ryo's old friend.

106
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:20,997
Why don't you sit down? Your drink,
Bloody Mary, okay, as usual?

107
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,543
I'll take it if there's no poison in it.

108
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,611
If you drink too much, anything
can be poison.

109
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,681
Well, well, we have everybody
now so let's start!

110
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:33,744
A party for my twentieth birthday and
Miki's last birthday in her 20s!

111
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,790
Whose last birthday in her 20s?
I have several left in my 20s!

112
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,317
Calm down. Anyway, both of you,
happy birthday!

113
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,469
Mary, you've drunk too much, haven't you?

114
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,638
I can't attend a party like this
without alcohol.

115
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,715
Ex-enemies are partying together happily...

116
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,684
You have really changed.

117
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,653
Kaori, how old are you going to
be next year?

118
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,623
Hey! Why next year?!

119
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:14,727
Oh, right. How old is Saeba now?
When is your birthday?

120
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,097
Well, if you have mokkori with me,
I'll tell you.

121
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,933
Oh, you're a man but you hide your age!

122
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,669
Kaori, I know you know. Tell me!

123
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,637
Well, I don't know either.

124
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,807
What? No way!

125
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:32,904
I understand she doesn't know.
Ryo, himself, doesn't know his age.

126
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,448
Mary...

127
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,886
Because Ryo doesn't know
when his birthday is.

128
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,080
Right, Ryo?

129
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,197
Ryo...

130
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,325
He doesn't know his own birthday.

131
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,736
Mary, Bloody Mary, model and sweeper.


132
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,648
Former assistant when Ryo was in
the US a long time ago,

133
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,484
the woman who knew Ryo
before I knew him.

134
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,918
The woman who knows
everything about Ryo.

135
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,557
I don't know anything about him.

136
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,720
I didn't even know he was in the US before.

137
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,929
Because Ryo doesn't know his birthday.

138
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,533
What does she mean by that?

139
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,470
Did I say that?

140
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,874
Take responsibility for what
you did and said!

141
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,312
Hey, don't be so loud. I've got a hangover.

142
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,214
Listen, don't say anything about our past
in front of Kaori, never ever!

143
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,019
Why can't I say that?

144
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,255
She's your assistant, isn't she?

145
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,155
She can know about you, can't she?

146
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,561
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to
bring up the old stories

147
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,463
which are already covered
with mold, and well...

148
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,623
How embarrassing!

149
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,862
Why are you upset and making
excuses like that?

150
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,202
Idiot! What are you doing?

151
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,804
Hurry up and put on some clothes.

152
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,574
Oh, what's wrong with you Ryo?
Since when you are shy like that?

153
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,201
No! If you don't do anything now...

154
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,678
Mary, breakfast is ready...

155
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,781
You jerk, first thing in the morning, you're...

156
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,750
What the hell are you doing!?

157
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,756
Wow, poor baby.

158
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,417
No breakfast for you!

159
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,563
Something is wrong with you. You could
have escaped from her attack.

160
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,121
Shut up! It's all your fault!

161
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,900
What kind of relationship is there
between you and her?

162
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,528
It seemed like she was jealous
of me, didn't it?

163
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,930
She just has violence syndrome.

164
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,708
I got it! Let's make the story short.

165
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,711
You don't want her to know about
your past because you love her.

166
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,481
If she finds out all about your past,
she might leave you!

167
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,249
What kind of misunderstanding is that?

168
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,118
Other than that, is there any
other good reason

169
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,819
why you keep an amateur like her
as your assistant?

170
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,522
She doesn't have any relatives or
family, so I let her stay here.

171
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,758
She's a mature woman.

172
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,216
You don't need to take care of her,
not like me at that time.

173
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,463
Don't you think this is a good opportunity
for you to make her get out of this world?

174
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:14,930
Screw her! She knows Ryo a little bit better
than I do, and she acts like she is so big.

175
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,817
I'm indeed an amateur...

176
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,580
Shall I be your coach?

177
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,315
No thanks.

178
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,163
Can you go out with me and
give me a guided tour now?

179
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,826
Why me? I thought you would
ask Ryo to do that.

180
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,303
You have something to ask me, don't you?

181
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,163
Well...

182
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:15,566
You want to ask me why Ryo doesn't
know his birthday, don't you?

183
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,304
You really want to know that badly?

184
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,072
I can't stop thinking about it.

185
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,108
What shall I do?

186
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,176
Ryo told me not to tell anything to you.

187
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:28,414
However, if you are going to marry Ryo,
I think you should know.

188
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,416
Marry?!

189
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:35,087
But I'm his assistant now

190
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,454
and I think I should know the same facts
that his former assistant knew.

191
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,098
I don't mind telling you about it,
but after you find out,

192
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:51,400
you might think that you and him
don't belong in the same world.

193
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:57,676
You might start thinking that you can't be
with him and you might leave him.

194
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,644
Do you still want to know?

195
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,271
Yes...

196
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,277
I see, okay.

197
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,156
This glass is not clean enough.

198
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,124
Oh, this menu has some stains!

199
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,459
Let's go. This place is no good.

200
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
Missed it.

201
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,963
Miki, please excuse me.

202
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,508
None of our business.

203
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,644
Ah, I want to know!

204
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,948
Falcon, don't you want to know,
or do you already know?

205
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,745
If you already know, can you tell us?!

206
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,684
Oh, we understand. We won't say
anything anymore. Yes, Sir!

207
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,367
The place where he was raised,
it was not in Japan.

208
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,075
Oh, so surprised?

209
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,612
Did you think an extraordinary man like him
had been raised in Japan normally,

210
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,046
and went to school here?

211
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,283
Well...

212
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,621
He was raised in a place which is very far
from the life of ordinary Japanese,

213
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,250
surrounded by lots of blood and
uncountable dead bodies.

214
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,718
That place was the battlefield.

215
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,489
The battlefield?!

216
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:49,080
When he was a little kid, he was already
carrying guns in the middle of the battlefield.

217
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,225
In a small country in Central America,
which had been in a civil war for a long time.

218
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,228
Central America? Why was he there?

219
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,963
He is Japanese, isn't he?

220
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,466
Of course, he's pure Japanese.

221
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,596
When he was little, he was thrown into the
middle of the jungle by himself, all alone.

222
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,239
There was a plane crash.

223
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:23,444
Either sightseeing or for business, anyway,
he was in that place with his parents.

224
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,962
Then, the plane crashed.

225
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,872
He lost his parents there. He appeared
to be the only survivor of that crash.

226
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,573
He wandered in the jungle for days,
and finally arrived at a village.

227
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:58,646
A village of guerrillas, which had been
fighting against government forces.

228
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,127
Their village needed only warriors.

229
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,229
In order to live in the village,

230
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,255
he didn't have any choice but
to become a guerrilla warrior.

231
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:13,272
He was a little kid, who didn't even know
his full name, nor his birthday,

232
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,266
but in order to survive, he had to learn
how to fight and live while fighting.

233
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,208
On top of that, he didn't have anybody
he could rely on.

234
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:27,675
Everybody there fought without thinking
about anything but surviving day by day.

235
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:33,125
Days passed, years passed, but the war
never ends in that country.

236
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,494
In the war, it seemed like it lasted forever.

237
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,930
People lost time, lost track of dates
and their own age.

238
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:50,368
The war finally ended with the victory by the
governmental forces after a long, long time.

239
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:56,749
Ryo and the other anti-government guerrillas
were chased out, scattering from the country.

240
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,119
Ryo and one of the guerrillas went to the US

241
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,088
and they joined the underground
world as a pair.

242
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:10,188
His partner died shortly, and after him,
I took over the position of Ryo's partner.

243
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:16,802
Now, you understand the reason why Ryo
doesn't know his birthday, don't you?

244
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,997
How do you feel? Are you satisfied?

245
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,109
She was shocked, just as I thought.

246
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,946
But you are the one who wanted to hear.

247
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,074
You are not the kind of woman who
can be with a man like Ryo.

248
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,512
It'd be best for you to leave him now.

249
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,673
My shoulder has been dislocated!

250
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,175
Hey, wait a sec, babe!

251
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,644
You hurt my brother and leave
without doing anything?

252
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,613
Why don't you pay us for treatment?!

253
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,112
I am so sorry!

254
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,449
Umibozu...

255
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,930
He's mean! He went out without us!

256
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,100
I know he probably followed Kaori!

257
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,366
He acted like that, but he must have been
interested in Saeba's past!

258
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,402
Oh, Saeba.

259
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,310
What's wrong? He doesn't look so good.

260
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,269
I think he didn't want Kaori
to know about his past.

261
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:43,313
That's why he looks sad. He thinks
that Kaori might leave him.

262
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,724
Hi, nice to see you again.

263
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,365
I told her everything. She was very
shocked by the story, I guess.

264
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,101
She might not come back to you ever again.

265
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,936
But this is good.

266
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:02,066
A woman like her shouldn't have anything
to do with the underground world.

267
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,739
What?!

268
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:05,878
Saeba!

269
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,742
Calm down!

270
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,448
I found it!

271
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,985
Hey, you, mokkori beauty!

272
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,621
Hey, let's go out together!

273
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,921
I asked thirty girls, but every one of them
said no, so I'm depressed!

274
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,596
Go away I said!

275
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,835
The thirty-first girl has just denied my offer.

276
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,133
I'm more and more depressed.

277
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,574
I was worried about him,
but he's the same as always.

278
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,565
I can't believe him!

279
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,315
I guess you are pretty shocked, aren't you?

280
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,083
Yes...

281
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,253
I can't believe that Ryo has
a horrible past like that.

282
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,590
I feel as if he's suddenly so far from me.

283
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,491
But that's not the only reason
I feel so depressed.

284
00:19:55,928 --> 00:20:01,066
While I was listening to Mary,
I felt miserable.

285
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,433
Because I didn't know anything
about Ryo's past.

286
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:11,410
The reason she knows about it, is because
Ryo told her about him, isn't it?

287
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,612
However, even though I have been
with him for over three years,

288
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,947
he has never told me anything.

289
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,916
Why? Why doesn't he trust me?

290
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,988
For Ryo, my existence is nothing like that.

291
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,192
Ryo doesn't trust me as his assistant.

292
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:31,151
I'm jealous of her and feel miserable,
and I hate doing so.

293
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,597
Really I feel miserable.

294
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:44,937
Ryo might have been afraid of the possibility
that you might see him in a different way.

295
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,850
He might have tried to avoid breaking
the relationship between you and him.

296
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,809
He doesn't consider you just a partner.

297
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,723
He looks at you as more than just a partner.

298
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,194
More than a partner? What do you mean?

299
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,332
It means...

300
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,735
I can't say something embarrassing
like that in my own words.

301
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:15,999
Umibozu!

302
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,246
Let me tell you one more thing.

303
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,409
Ryo didn't tell Mary about his past.

304
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,487
The man who was Ryo's first partner,

305
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,557
the one who was a guerrilla and
went to the US with Ryo...

306
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:36,891
He taught Ryo everything about
how to fight and trained him.

307
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,359
He was also Mary's father.

308
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,105
Then Mary heard the story from her father.

309
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:51,410
That's right. He's never told
anyone about himself.

310
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:59,146
Now, you think about what
to do for yourself.

311
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,110
Thank you, Umibozu.

312
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,735
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

313
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,432
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

314
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:26,333
But I couldn't do so

315
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:36,844
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

316
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:43,250
You don't know the reason I'm here

317
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:58,176
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

318
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,543
I wouldn't have let you go

319
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:09,818
When I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

320
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:16,060
Everyday life is starting

321
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:26,336
In my mind, time has stopped

322
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:32,677
And a double-decker bus is passing

323
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,153
It's a good thing that you take Mary out
and guide her around,

324
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,555
but it's too obvious what you're really
thinking. Your face is relaxed.

325
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,558
There are so many obstacles and
my date is destroyed.

326
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,995
I thought something was wrong, but I
didn't know Mary was trying to kill me.

327
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,863
You were so happy when she asked you
to go to the hotel together,

328
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:52,798
but somebody shot you?

329
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,298
Damn it!
And somebody shot you?

330
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:53,799
Damn it!

331
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,235
But why? Why does she want to kill you,
her former partner?!

332
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,503
City Hunter 2:

333
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,174
"Good Luck, My Sweeper
City Streets for Both of Us (Part 2)"

334
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,142
If you miss it, someone will try to kill you!

335
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,272
Please look forward to the next episode
