00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,997
It's been a week.

13
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,831
I wonder if it's possible to find him in
this town without any information?

14
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,904
But there is no other way to do this,

15
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,600
and patience is the most important
thing in this business.

16
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,909
Well, he doesn't fit my image.

17
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,890
He's got sharp eyes, not like
an ordinary man.

18
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,892
He looks like a predator on the prowl.

19
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,594
And he's got his hand in his jacket.

20
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,028
He might be holding a gun.

21
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,396
This is it!

22
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,464
He might be...

23
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,931
Yes, he surely must be...

24
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,931
The City Hunter, Ryo Saeba.

25
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,229
The Target is Ryo!
The Camerawoman Loves Danger (Part 1)

26
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,183
Congratulations!

27
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,785
You are today's first beauty!

28
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,420
Well, well, let's go out on a date!

29
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,887
Stop it!

30
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,354
What the hell is he doing?

31
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,293
Cut it out!

32
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,597
Hey, wait a second!

33
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,065
Hey, why don't you wait?!

34
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,637
You bump into me and then
expect to just walk away?

35
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,505
Oh, sorry. I was in a hurry.

36
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,640
Stop fooling around!

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,608
Do you know who we are?

38
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,445
He doesn't look worried at all,

39
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,414
even though he is surrounded
by a bunch of gangsters.

40
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,177
I'm pretty sure he's not an ordinary man.

41
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,252
He just looked at me.

42
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,921
I wonder if he noticed me?

43
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:12,051
Well, if I'm right, he'll finish them
in a second.

44
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:19,829
Oh, help me! No, stop!

45
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,169
That was pretty sad.

46
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,372
You couldn't fight back at all.

47
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,409
I guess it was silly of me to
think you might be him.

48
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,610
Who?

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,612
The City Hunter, Ryo Saeba.

50
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,514
Haven't you heard the stories?

51
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,277
Well, I guess...

52
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,753
The courageous hunter who fights against
crimes that can't be prosecuted.

53
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,590
He is surely the Superman who
protects the justice of the city.

54
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,693
Really? Well, I think that's
a little exaggerated.

55
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,027
Why are you embarrassed?

56
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,829
I am not praising you.

57
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,592
Well, yes, you are right.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,970
I am Yoko Fuyuno, a freelance cameraman.

59
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,138
I want to get close to him
and do a story on him.

60
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,232
Then I'll show the whole nation
how brave he is.

61
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,877
This is no joke.

62
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,244
If she does that, everybody in
Japan will know my face.

63
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,882
I wouldn't be able to work undercover.

64
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,418
Goodbye.

65
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,054
Hey, I treated your wounds.

66
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,885
It won't hurt to tell me your name.

67
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,593
I am Ryo... I mean I'm Mr. Ryo from Shinjuku.

68
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,662
I'm just a silly playboy.

69
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,429
Ryo...

70
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,566
Wow, you have the same name
as Ryo Saeba.

71
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:30,036
So why don't you work out so as
to become stronger?

72
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,704
If you have the time to
hit on women that is?

73
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,141
Yes, Ma'am. I will take your words to heart.

74
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,608
Well, goodbye.

75
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,945
What a strange man.

76
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,614
Yomiaki Newspaper

77
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,842
Yomiaki Newspaper
Hi, Ms. Fuyuno.

78
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,450
Hello, Sir.

79
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,085
You look unhappy.

80
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,789
Well, I guess you haven't found
lover-boy yet, have you?

81
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,192
No, I search for him in town everyday, but...

82
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,561
I see. Well, I'm going to tell you
something good.

83
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,799
I've heard that in order to see him,
you have to use a code.

84
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,266
A code?

85
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,403
XYZ -
I'll be waiting for
you at 12 PM in
Shinjuku Park.

86
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,740
Waiting for you...

87
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,365
This handwriting looks like it's a woman's.

88
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,751
No, there's nobody there.

89
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,948
You're a liar. Every time the client is
a nice woman, you do this to me.

90
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,093
Damn!

91
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:27,684
Pass!

92
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,500
It's such a shame, but she's the dangerous
camerawoman I met yesterday.

93
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,992
What? You mean she's the one
trying to get your picture?

94
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,276
Don't scream. We just want
to have a little fun.

95
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,244
No way! Let me go!

96
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,487
Who the hell is throwing things at me?!

97
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,656
Hurry up, come this way!

98
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,058
Oh, she ran away!

99
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,491
Get her!

100
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,362
Hold it!

101
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,557
Beyond this point, the street is blocked.

102
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,621
That man?

103
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,936
You're that man from yesterday.

104
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,238
Do you want to have the hell
beaten out of you again?

105
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,140
There is no cameraman aiming at
me today, so I'll be all right.

106
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,611
Therefore, I can deal with you seriously.

107
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,214
What the hell are you talking about?

108
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,183
Interesting, why don't you show me
how serious you are?

109
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,486
It was too dark to identify him,
but who was that man?

110
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,991
Well, I am pretty sure that
he's finally appeared!

111
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,326
I can't run away like this!

112
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,884
Oh, Ms. Yoko!

113
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,611
He did this in only a few seconds.

114
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,670
This means, that man surely must be...

115
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,148
Damn!

116
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,020
Well, I guess I can't make any excuses now.

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,388
Yes, as you already knew,

118
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:06,415
I am the man you have been looking for,
the City Hunter, Ryo Saeba.

119
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,897
Liar!

120
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,531
I get it. I understand.

121
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,939
You came across the site where
those men were attacking me,

122
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,609
and you couldn't do anything about it,
so you just watched us.

123
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,912
Then, he, the City Hunter, appeared

124
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,080
and finished those guys in a second.
Then he left.

125
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,182
Excuse me...

126
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:34,086
So you try to steal his achievement
as your own, and ask me out.

127
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,553
I am right, aren't I?

128
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,117
Yes, indeed! I am impressed
by your intelligence.

129
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,062
Just as I thought.

130
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,631
I am sure he's not a wimp
and a pervert like you.

131
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,201
Oh, yes, exactly. He is totally
different from me.

132
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,535
He appeared just like a gust of wind.

133
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,703
He was so cool.

134
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,605
Also, his facial features are
so sharp, just like a wolf.

135
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,909
What's wrong?

136
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,914
You mean you saw his face, don't you?

137
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,984
Well, I guess... Yes.

138
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,154
Good! You are to be my
assistant from now on.

139
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,917
You will be useful in my search for him.

140
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,957
Damn!

141
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:17,120
In order to compensate for trying to trick me,
you'll work for me starting tomorrow.

142
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,271
What the hell? City Hunter?

143
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,140
Please, I would like to know
what he looks like.

144
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,642
I'll pay you for your cooperation.

145
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,210
Oh, I see.

146
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,346
Then I guess I can give you
some information.

147
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,938
His face looks like...

148
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,712
I have no idea who you're talking about!

149
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,715
What was that?

150
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,661
I haven't seen or even heard
about a man like that! Bye!

151
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,128
Wait!

152
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,989
This is good.

153
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,736
The only thing I have to do is stare at
them from behind Yoko.

154
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,172
I have never ever seen him.

155
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,114
I don't understand why they run away
after I say his name.

156
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,283
I guess they are afraid of him.

157
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,552
Maybe they know that they'll be
punished by him if they talk.

158
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,389
I see, then it's useless to work like this.

159
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,326
By the way, you're too persistent to just want
a picture of the City Hunter, aren't you?

160
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,586
Are there any other reasons why
you are so attracted to him?

161
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:30,197
Well, I guess so. Other than the interest
as a cameraman, let's see...

162
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,333
I might fall in love with him.

163
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,301
Ryo Saeba, who lives a hard life in
a hard world, is the ideal man.

164
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,613
I wouldn't mind devoting myself to him.

165
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,682
Devoting myself to him...

166
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:57,161
Ms. Yoko, the City Hunter you've been
looking for is, actually...

167
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,036
What the hell is this?!

168
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,438
It's a kind of seizure.

169
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,174
It happens to him all the time so don't worry.

170
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,544
Oh, Ms. Yoko, your lunch doesn't seem
touched. Can't you eat?

171
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,713
Ah, no, I don't have much of an appetite.

172
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,147
What a waste!

173
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,650
If you want, I'll give it to you.

174
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,117
Give it to you...

175
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,449
Ms. Yoko, I am really...

176
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,696
What kind of sibling relationship is this?

177
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,291
The brother suddenly becomes a pervert,
and the sister gets violent.

178
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,902
I've been thinking about it anyway.

179
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,071
It was a mistake to make you my assistant.

180
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,936
You are nothing but an obstacle to my job.

181
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,176
Don't say such things, please.
We would do anything for you.

182
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,736
But you don't know anything about
camerawork, so no more.

183
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,478
How about this?

184
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,749
I can be a human tripod
for a camera. Mokkori!

185
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,921
Stop that! That's embarrassing!

186
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,253
I can't be around you people any longer.

187
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,526
Oh, please wait, Ms. Yoko.

188
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,861
You forgot your camera!

189
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,664
I don't want a camera that's
been in a place like that.

190
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,154
I'll give it to you.

191
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,295
I'm really...

192
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,561
No!

193
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,342
You're really a ridiculous pervert.

194
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,777
I understand that very well. Goodbye.

195
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,012
Oh, no! Wait for me, Ms. Yoko.

196
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,172
Saeba!

197
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,582
I finally found you.

198
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,084
I won't let you go.

199
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,720
Your bill for three months,
pay it right now!

200
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,056
Oh, the owner of Snack Potato!



201
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,182
Things happen!

202
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,528
Saeba?

203
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,363
Ryo?

204
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,224
Ryo Saeba?

205
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,968
No way! It has to be a lie!

206
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,103
Is that your name?

207
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,934
No way! Oh, no!

208
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,076
I wonder if the reason why those
people ran away from me was...

209
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,035
I see. They were scared because
you were with me.

210
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,490
What? Twin brothers?

211
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,628
Yes, I am Ryoji Saeba and
people call me Mr. Ryo.

212
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,961
The reason they ran away was because
they thought I was my twin brother.

213
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,857
So that's what happened.

214
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,725
I understand now.

215
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,940
I am so relieved that you're not the one.

216
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,137
That's it. Why don't you go home today?

217
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,102
No, the most important thing in
this business is patience.

218
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,155
Well, is it true that you are going to
stay here from tonight?

219
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,626
Yes, if Ryoji is his younger brother,
I am sure that he will visit.

220
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:45,030
I understand that. However, nobody
knows when he will be here.

221
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,227
Also, it's very dangerous for you
to stay here for a long time.

222
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,668
Dangerous?

223
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,133
Yes, Ryoji sometimes has terrible seizures.

224
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,103
What do you want?

225
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,004
Ryoji...

226
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,412
Yes?

227
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,006
I'll give it to you...

228
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,716
What?

229
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,657
What's wrong? He doesn't react at all.

230
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,626
It's strange. I wonder if he
has recovered or not?

231
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,695
First of all, I don't think
the seizures are real.

232
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,789
Someone just says "give" and he
transforms into a horrible beast.

233
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,496
Give...

234
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,738
Thank you very much!

235
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,246
Carnal desires begone

236
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,285
What's your problem, jerk?!

237
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,152
You didn't react to me at all,
but you reacted to Ms. Yoko.

238
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,363
What are you doing here?

239
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:55,322
You seem to want me to stop
working on this, but why?

240
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,870
Well, City Hunter can only live
in a world of darkness.

241
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,975
You don't know anything about
working undercover.

242
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,677
If his real face is known, he'll be
unable to do his job.

243
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,384
If you have any consideration for him,
please leave him alone.

244
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,388
But...

245
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:23,095
I can't stand people thinking he
is just a predator.

246
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,431
So, in order to correct
their misunderstanding,

247
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,332
I want to show them what he's really like.

248
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,371
No, I know he will refuse you.

249
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,269
Give up!

250
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,673
Well, you're missing the point.

251
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,313
He will understand me.

252
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,076
I will meet him face to face and ask him.

253
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:50,189
Just as I thought, Mr. Ryo the
playboy can't convince her.

254
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,691
Why don't you tell her the truth
and accept her interview

255
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,818
with the condition of not
publishing your face?

256
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,527
No good.

257
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,529
Even so, everyone would know
she saw my face.

258
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:05,496
Then, the people who want to
kill me will go after her.

259
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,776
In this situation, there is no one who
can convince her except him,

260
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,334
the City Hunter.


261
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,584
Who is it?

262
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,319
Mr. Saeba?

263
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,451
Yes, I am Saeba.

264
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,326
His voice is different.

265
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,793
That's not Ryoji.

266
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,697
Oh, no, are you...

267
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,997
Yes, I am Ryo Saeba, the man
you've been looking for.

268
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,272
Oh, please wait.

269
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,608
I'm coming out now. I just have
to put on some clothes.

270
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,277
No, please listen to me as you are now.

271
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,478
I can't see you.

272
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,780
Why?

273
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,683
You've heard the answer
from my brother Ryoji.

274
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,412
I can't give you an interview.

275
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,323
You're better off not knowing anything
about the world I live in.

276
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,382
Forget about City Hunter.

277
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,722
Wait, the reason I want to see you
is not only that, but...

278
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,332
My brother told me how you feel about me.

279
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,535
Oh, no...

280
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,973
However, I'm afraid I have to tell you
that I have someone I love.

281
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,513
I think I had better go now.

282
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,639
Goodbye...

283
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,818
That underwear! Ms. Yoko must have just
taken them off a second ago.

284
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,654
Please wait!

285
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,288
Mr. Saeba, please wait. I want to
talk to you some more.

286
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,199
Oh, I'm so happy!

287
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,772
You tricked me!

288
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,333
Now, I won't move out until I see him!

289
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,605
Oh, boy. It was so close to succeeding too.

290
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,152
Ryo, you have a guest.

291
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,086
Guest?

292
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,280
Hi, Ryo.

293
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,951
Saeko? What do you want?

294
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,431
Help you destroy a drug
smuggling organization?

295
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,066
When did you promise to help her?

296
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,035
Well, I don't remember.

297
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,936
Don't pretend you don't remember.

298
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,064
When we went out drinking a little
while ago, you promised.

299
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,045
I don't care about you owing me
a couple of times.

300
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,380
I've forgotten them already.

301
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,585
Since it's you, Saeko, I will
help you free of charge.

302
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,020
Trust me.

303
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,578
When did she tape that conversation?

304
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,957
This is a simple job.

305
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:43,291
I want you to help me prove that a company
called Hakuryu Trading is smuggling drugs.

306
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,332
According to our information,
they're moving the drugs

307
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,635
to another location tonight
in order to hide them.

308
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,703
But as you know, we don't
have any evidence.

309
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,472
That's where you come in.

310
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,340
This is a part of their route.

311
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,278
Look! The truck loaded with drugs will drive
by the South Shinjuku Police Station.

312
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,872
The truck will have an accident right here.

313
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,582
I see.

314
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,519
You'll accidentally find drugs
at the accident site.

315
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,986
That's right.

316
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,424
Well, hope you do a good job tonight.

317
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,659
Hey, wait a second!

318
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,162
As I told you, I can't do anything
while Yoko is here.

319
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,430
You're a professional, aren't you?

320
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,897
Thank you for your cooperation.

321
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,827
Kaori, where is Ms. Yoko?

322
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,470
She is reading a book in the living room.

323
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,665
Good, I have to go now.

324
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,215
Oh, where are you going, Mr. Saeba?

325
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,616
I wonder if you could take me with you?

326
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,015
Ms. Yoko...

327
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:44,449
I figure you're going to see your twin
brother, Ryo Saeba, aren't you?

328
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,193
The woman who visited a while ago came
to ask him about a job, didn't she?

329
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,196
So, you're leaving to give him a message.

330
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,098
Oh, no, don't be silly.

331
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,567
Then why are you trying to
sneak out of here?

332
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,070
There is no other reason to
do so except to see him.

333
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,471
Well...

334
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,107
He is going to work at his second job.

335
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,309
Our financial situation is so bad recently...

336
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,645
Oh, yes, my second job.

337
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,546
Oh, really?

338
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,549
A job which you need to sneak
out for sounds interesting.

339
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,779
I am going with you.

340
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,882
Gay Bar Erotica

341
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,887
Hi, Ms. Yoko.

342
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,258
I am sorry about lying to you.

343
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,095
I was too embarrassed to tell you that I have
to dress up as a woman at my job.

344
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,830
I'll give you good service.

345
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,332
Well, not so much.

346
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,291
Nobody would expect the younger brother of
the City Hunter to be working at a gay bar.

347
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,339
Well, let's have a party!

348
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,341
Ah, I don't feel too good right now.

349
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,808
Excuse me, but I have to go
to the ladies' room.

350
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,182
I am sorry for asking you for such a favor.

351
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,449
Don't worry about it.

352
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:48,215
I've been thinking about having you work
here, so why don't you stay on?

353
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,884
Oh, I feel sick. I think I'll go home.

354
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,264
I am glad the bar is so close to the
South Shinjuku Police Station.

355
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,925
It's almost time for that truck.

356
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,734
Oh, where is Mr. Saeba?

357
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,469
Oh my, where did he go?

358
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,096
He'll be back soon. Let's drink.

359
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,931
Damn!

360
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,718
Damn, the truck is late.

361
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,117
It's time.

362
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,089
Ryoji!

363
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:24,823
What?!

364
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,659
What are you doing alone in this alley?

365
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,329
You're going to meet him here
just as I thought.

366
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,964
You almost managed to fool me.

367
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,693
No, that's not true.

368
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:42,974
It's here!

369
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,844
Ms. Yoko, I was just...

370
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,712
What?

371
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:51,411
I just wanted you to come here
so we could be alone.

372
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,285
Hakuryu Trading

373
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,222
No!

374
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,658
No!

375
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,391
Oh, no!

376
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,405
Ryoji!

377
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,265
Ryoji is... Ryoji is... It's my fault!

378
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,330
Oh, Ryoji, you're all right!

379
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,197
The truck had an accident.

380
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,651
He did a perfect job.

381
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,213
Thank you.

382
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,427
But the accident was our fault.

383
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,227
Don't worry about it.

384
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,396
We have to run as fast as we can
in this kind of situation.

385
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,694
How irresponsible!

386
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:32,639
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

387
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,122
Marude juni dake kisou Faye Dunaway

388
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,853
Yuushoku mo tabezu ni, diet food

389
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:47,992
Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

390
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,404
Kimi wa kangeki mo sezu morau dake de

391
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,737
Mansion no temae de, say goodbye

392
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:02,841
Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no
otoko to iu mono o

393
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:11,920
Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa
sou wa inai hazu sa

394
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,825
Don't you, don't you know

395
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:20,198
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

396
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:28,037
Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,
ju-yon-kai mo shogezu ni

397
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,937
Hontou no dance, chance,
romance wa jibun shidai da ze

398
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,453
Ms. Yoko would do anything to find
City Hunter, wouldn't she?

399
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,621
It's really difficult for me to work.

400
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,956
She's happy even though she
was caught by a gang.

401
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,158
But you will rescue her, won't you?

402
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,192
She doesn't want me to rescue her.

403
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,060
She wants to be rescued by City Hunter.

404
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,128
How selfish!

405
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,097
I guess she needs to learn the hard way.

406
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,331
Then are you going to leave her like that?

407
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,357
No way, but I will make her see how
terrible the underworld is.

408
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,069
City Hunter 2:

409
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,306
"The Target is Ryo!
The Camerawoman Loves Danger (Part 2)"

410
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,274
If you don't watch it, I'm gonna
reveal your true figure.

411
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,677
Please look forward to the next episode
