1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blended in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,600
The client is the daughter of the president
of the Tachibana Company.

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,635
She is going on a trip to Southeast Asia

15
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,638
so she wants you to be her self-defense
and shooting instructor.

16
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,807
I'll teach you well.

17
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,642
In addition, how about falling
in love with someone?

18
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,810
Sounds good.

19
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,045
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,316
You don't bring in enough money to live on,
so we have to earn lots of money now.

21
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,944
The pay they're offering is
outstanding this time.

22
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,894
Ms. Emi, Mr. Saeba is here!

23
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,661
Ms. Emi! Mr. Saeba has arrived.

24
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,502
Where are you, Ms. Emi!

25
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,439
Ms. Emi!

26
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,574
Ms. Emi!

27
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
Sorry to surprise you.

28
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,311
I'm Emi. Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,021
Nice to meet you too.

30
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:41,549
Ryo Is an Instructor
Extreme Mokkori Tactics

31
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,401
Incredible!

32
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,959
This is something.

33
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,605
What are those?

34
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,234
The newest self-defense weapons.

35
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:01,804
A 40,000 volt per second stun gun
giving a paralyzing shock.

36
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,742
A security flashlight with chemical
spray to paralyze the eyes.

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,416
A bracelet with knock-out gas, and so on.

38
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,321
How did you collect all those things
when you're not a professional?

39
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,327
My father's company is a big firm.

40
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,162
Anything can be obtained.

41
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,199
No matter what kind of guy attacks you, you
wouldn't be scared with those things.

42
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,301
Oh, who gets scared?

43
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,536
You want me to say that I don't need
these things, don't you?

44
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,938
Exactly.

45
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,607
Jerk! Who do you think you are?!

46
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,609
Please forgive me!

47
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,110
We have to start her lesson now!

48
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,375
Do you think he's the proper
person, Ms. Emi?

49
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,279
I think so if the rumor is right.

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,923
Kaori, you are an obstruction
to training so wait outside.

51
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,221
Hey, Ryo! Open!

52
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,662
First of all, try screaming.

53
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,066
The purpose is to make the attacker
hesitate by screaming.

54
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,302
But I don't want to learn stuff like that.

55
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,303
I know that.

56
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,396
However, these are steps to reach the target.

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,003
Somebody, help me!

58
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,445
The door is locked!

59
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,679
He's such a jerk.

60
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,113
Somebody, help me!

61
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,917
Your voice isn't loud enough.

62
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,385
I can't hear you even though I'm
right here in front of you.

63
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,220
I guess I have to do it.

64
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,360
Mr. Saeba, what are you doing?

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,827
Well...

66
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,695
Emi, I love you!

67
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,769
Somebody, help me!

68
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,671
Bastard!

69
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,506
Pervert
Extermination

70
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,875
That's it! Don't forget it.

71
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,842
Yes!

72
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,811
What? You were teaching seriously?

73
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,914
Now, the next one.

74
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,816
When you're in danger,

75
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,717
the most important thing is to be calm
and run away as soon as possible.

76
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,824
But what shall I do if I don't
have time to run away?

77
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,059
Good question.

78
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,028
In that case, self-defense.

79
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,429
Turn to your right.

80
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,896
Yes!

81
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,801
First of all, attacked from behind.

82
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802
Ryo...

83
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,793
How can he do things like that in front of me?

84
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,207
It's okay, Ms. Kaori. This is training.

85
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,209
Ms. Emi, you don't need to hesitate at all.

86
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,511
Do whatever you can do.

87
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,978
This is a molester!

88
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,107
Yes, I will.

89
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,826
Wow, you're incredible, Ms. Emi!

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,198
That's it. You can do it when you try.

91
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,929
You can do anything if you
try for your dear life.

92
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,408
Tachibana Company,
time to merge.

93
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,605
Tachibana Company,
time to merge.
Where the hell did the president go
at a critical time like this?

94
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,075
Mr. Kudo, don't you have any
idea where he went?

95
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,952
Why do you think I know what his
daughter doesn't know?

96
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,620
This is absurd.

97
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,756
Anyway, since the president is out,

98
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,593
I will deal with matters relating to the
merger by myself as vice-president.

99
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,584
I understand, but...

100
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,698
Even if the result isn't what he wants,
in this situation,

101
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,258
I expect him to accept without any questions.

102
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,471
You have changed a lot.

103
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,931
You used to talk with my father when
the two of you couldn't agree.

104
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,710
At that time, both the president
and I were young.

105
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,814
We can't drag youth out forever.

106
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,277
Oh, no...

107
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,429
If he's the same as usual, at a
time like this, he will...

108
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,507
My real activities start from this point.

109
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,047
Oh, she's not here.

110
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,286
Where did she go in the middle of the night?

111
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,128
Indeed, made from Italian silk.

112
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,789
Yes, there is more, I'm sure.

113
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,973
Kaori?!

114
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,975
You really are something!

115
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,845
Wait a second, I have something
to investigate, so...

116
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,480
Something to investigate?

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,211
There is no suitcase prepared
for travel in this room.

118
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,084
Now that you mention it...

119
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,326
Mauser, the king of military guns, isn't it?

120
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,368
However, at over 440m per second,
and weighing 1 kg,

121
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,632
I wonder if it might not be proper
for a female to use one?

122
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,975
This is a memento of my grandfather.

123
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,840
Why do you want to learn
how to fight so much?

124
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,380
I don't have enough time.

125
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,283
Sorry, but I checked your room.

126
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,944
It's a lie that you're going to travel, isn't it?

127
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,919
I'd heard that your father has been
missing for a while.

128
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,427
Missing right before the merger
of the company.

129
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,229
I wonder if he was kidnapped or something?

130
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,992
How do you know about it?!

131
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,232
Because it's my business.

132
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,205
My father was strongly against
the merger of his company.

133
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,208
He left a very short memo and went on a trip.

134
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,877
I'm going on a journey.
Don't worry about me.
He left a very short memo and went on a trip.

135
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,077
I'm going on a journey.
Don't worry about me.
It's impossible for me to expect him
to do things like this.

136
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,874
It's impossible for me to expect him
to do things like this.

137
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:39,752
If he can't attend the stockholder's meeting
the day after tomorrow, the merger will be...

138
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,222
Vice-President Kudo, who wants to go ahead
and merge, will do whatever he wants to do.

139
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,350
He's the one who disagrees
with your father, isn't he?

140
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,259
Yes...

141
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,432
And so, because I didn't believe it

142
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,736
I secretly went to Mr. Kudo's second
house in the mountains

143
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,473
and there were several men
guarding the place.

144
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,668
One of them had a gun.

145
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,547
Then I knew that my father is there.

146
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,715
Why didn't you contact the
police at that time?

147
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,683
No.

148
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,550
I want to solve this problem by myself.

149
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,151
No matter what happens to me,
just by myself.

150
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,043
Don't use just your wrist.

151
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,510
Aim it by using your arm from the elbow.

152
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,809
Yes!

153
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,451
No!

154
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,146
Maintain equilibrium from your lower back.

155
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,022
Ryo, her finger is bleeding.

156
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,792
It's okay, Ms. Kaori.

157
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,694
Just blisters and bruised fingers.

158
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,787
Mr. Saeba, shall we continue?

159
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,361
Well, next, lie on your stomach,
then aim at the target.

160
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,076
Done.

161
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,568
This training is so hard that even guys
would cry, but you're doing so well.

162
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,549
Why are you protecting Mr. Kudo so much?

163
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:25,424
My father and Mr. Kudo started the
Tachibana Company thirty years ago

164
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,484
from a little tiny office and now
it's a huge enterprise.

165
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,394
They've been good partners for long time.

166
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,767
I see, partners.

167
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,636
Yes...

168
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:41,903
The reason my father's business has been so
successful is that Mr. Kudo played a big part.

169
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:50,182
Mr. Kudo was gentle with me, when I was
sad because my father got mad at me,

170
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:57,213
or when I was lonely while my father was so
busy, he would come to me and talk to me.

171
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,022
He loved me as if I were his real daughter.

172
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:08,959
Mr. Kudo was a very important person for
me at that time, just like my father.

173
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,035
But why would a person like that
kidnap your father?

174
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,611
It might be because the business succeeded
and the company got bigger.

175
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,849
A huge enterprise is like a monster.

176
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,478
Because of that monster, their friendship
might have collapsed.

177
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,788
I guess...

178
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,827
I don't want to make Mr. Kudo into a criminal.

179
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,369
I see.


180
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,538
You want to consider this kidnapping
as an internal company issue,

181
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,506
and don't want to report it
to the police officially.

182
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,711
Forgiving someone actually takes a lot
more courage than you'd think.

183
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,477
I wish Mr. Kudo would understand
what Ms. Emi is feeling now.

184
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,029
In order to win a battle against a criminal,
first of all, you need self-confidence.

185
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,765
If there is a stick close to you,
use it to poke him.

186
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,960
Whatever chance you have, use it
as best as you can.

187
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,427
Yes!

188
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:23,175
To keep holding a three pound gun for a
long time, this training is necessary.

189
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,735
Look, your wrists are going lower.

190
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,779
Yes!

191
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,484
Now, the last one once more.

192
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,519
After this, two days of training will be over.

193
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,520
Yes!


194
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,457
I forgot to tell you that women have a strong
weapon that was given to them at birth.

195
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,196
This weapon is very effective to
catch someone flat-footed,

196
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,432
especially if the enemy is a man.

197
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:51,670
Flashing a part of your body for a moment
will attack the center of his brain,

198
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,408
and make him lose his whole ability to take
action, except in some rare cases.

199
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,178
Do you understand what I want to say?

200
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,579
I guess...

201
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,841
Well, let's try.

202
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,454
Mr. Saeba, what we're doing now is
the training to the end, isn't it,

203
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,751
to rescue my father?

204
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,758
Yes, there's no time for you
to get embarrassed.

205
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,795
You think I am a pervert or
something, don't you?

206
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,196
How shameful!

207
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,663
I understand.

208
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,203
What kind of way is that to open it?!

209
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,905
No sex appeal or anything!

210
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,237
What the hell is that little piece of cloth?

211
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,211
When you put on things like that,
they don't have any effectiveness.

212
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,746
Hurry up and take it off!

213
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,814
But...

214
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
No questions allowed.

215
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,410
This is necessary to complete this lesson.

216
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,720
Exactly as I thought.

217
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,691
At the end of the training, I have to
finish it like this, don't I?

218
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,026
You're right.

219
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,562
Surprise attack only!

220
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,330
Don't use your gun until you really need to.

221
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,797
Understand?

222
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,135
Yes!

223
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,278
Ryo, are you really going to
let her go by herself?

224
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,372
Well, I want to see how much
she can do by herself.

225
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,149
But...

226
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,141
There's no way I can win if I
attack them from the front.

227
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,665
Only a surprise attack...

228
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,990
Did you hear something?

229
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,725
Wind, I guess.

230
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,427
To make sure, go and watch the back door.

231
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,263
Sure.

232
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,754
Damn, that scene was the
best part of the show!

233
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,204
What is this?

234
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,107
My 40,000 volt stun gun.

235
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,372
If I use it cleverly, I could win the battle.


236
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,986
Hey, what's the matter?

237
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,831
Something's wrong downstairs.

238
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,763
Go and check it out.

239
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,804
Where is my father! Answer me!

240
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,742
Hey, what's the matter?
Pull yourself together!

241
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,322
Damn!

242
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,194
Whatever chance you have,
use it as best you can.

243
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,460
Emi Tachibana, do my best.

244
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,431
Damn, who the hell are you?!

245
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,378
Sorry, but you need to sleep a little longer.

246
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,564
Dad!

247
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,301
Dad!

248
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:19,965
Sleeping pills...

249
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,911
I see.

250
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,413
Dad was forced to sleep.

251
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,880
Don't move!

252
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:34,617
You're very brave to come from far away
to rescue your father, Lady.

253
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,693
However, you're a little short of skill
to get even against professionals.

254
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:47,632
If you fight for dear life, a girl like you
will be able to win the fight.

255
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:59,503
Someone, help me!

256
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,046
Cut it out.

257
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,548
Even if you ask someone to help like that,

258
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,516
this place is in the middle of the
mountains so nobody will come.

259
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,318
I'm just charging myself.

260
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,319
What?

261
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,786
My turn.

262
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,870
Papa! Papa!

263
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,576
Don't move.

264
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,348
If you can, go ahead and shoot me.

265
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,923
What? What the hell?

266
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,643
This is heavier than I thought,
but it was very effective.

267
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,320
This is it.

268
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,290
I let down my guard since you're
a woman, but now, I won't.

269
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,257
Take this!

270
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,311
Did I do that?

271
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,617
Hi, good job.

272
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,221
Since the instructor was good, the student
improved her skills very quickly.

273
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,485
Mr. Saeba, when did you get here?

274
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,124
Rather than asking questions of me, you
have something to ask that man, don't you?

275
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,530
Let me go! What the hell
are you doing to me?

276
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,898
This is my private second house.

277
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,567
I'm gonna sue you for trespassing.

278
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,204
Go ahead, but kidnapping is a
more serious crime than that.

279
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,005
What are you talking about?

280
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,674
It's a waste of time to pretend not to know.

281
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,410
I could ask that guy with the sunglasses
and he would explain instantly.

282
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,477
I don't know.

283
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,246
Who the hell are those guys?

284
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,237
They used my place without my permission.

285
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,342
Mr. Kudo...

286
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:25,090
Emi doesn't want to report to
the police about her father

287
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,615
because you used to love her as if
she were your own daughter.

288
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,425
That's why she tried to make this
situation straight by herself.

289
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,961
She is sad and also very gentle.

290
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,096
Why can't you get it?!

291
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:53,719
If possible, I don't want my father
to know about this incident.

292
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:58,213
I want Mr. Kudo to be the
best partner for my father.

293
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,738
Well, Mr. Kudo, would you please help me
to carry my father down?

294
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,748
Yes...

295
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:45,360
That bullet I fired didn't hit that man
even by accident.

296
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,663
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

297
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:04,589
You were asked to be her instructor only,
but you were a bodyguard too.

298
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,124
I can't believe you did it.

299
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,957
I guess it was aftercare service.

300
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,897
Oh, you're trying to be cool, aren't you?

301
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,499
I wonder if you'd give me aftercare service?

302
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,868
What? Did you say something?

303
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,699
No, nothing.

304
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:33,917
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

305
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,390
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

306
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,121
You skip dinner and eat diet food

307
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:49,260
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

308
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:53,672
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

309
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:57,005
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

310
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:04,109
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

311
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:13,188
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

312
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,093
Don't you, don't you know

313
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:21,466
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

314
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:29,305
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

315
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:35,205
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

316
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,452
One more Zaru-soba noodle!

317
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,888
How can you eat this horrible tasting soba?

318
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,623
Because this is handmade by Mika.

319
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,592
It's such a waste that this restaurant
is to be sold to someone.

320
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,927
With this horrible taste, it can happen.

321
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,228
The noodles need to be more delicious.

322
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,863
Then she needs to have a coach.

323
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,633
There's a man who knows a lot about
soba noodle. Let's ask him.

324
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,600
How lucky!

325
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,431
However, he's a prison breaker.

326
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,671
City Hunter 2:

327
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,275
"Ryo Is a Gourmet
Nice PR for the Soba Noodle Beauty"

328
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,843
If you don't watch it, it won't be delicious.

329
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,802
Please look forward to the next episode
