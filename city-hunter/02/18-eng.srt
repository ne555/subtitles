00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:38,331
Mokkori Beauty, Ms. Misa, who came
from the Pamela Republic.

13
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,234
I'm going to teach her the way of
a traditional Japanese woman.

14
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,503
She is the daughter of the Home Secretary.

15
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,438
If something happens to her, it's going
to be a diplomatic incident.

16
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,439
I know that.

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,241
Anyway, I've heard that some
terrorists followed her

18
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,606
and they've entered Japan already.

19
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,877
Leave the matter to me!

20
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,647
I won't forgive anyone who interrupts my
mokkori mission, no matter who they are.

21
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,650
You're hopeless. Anyway, no matter
what your reason was,

22
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,811
I should congratulate you because
you've protected her.

23
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,622
But I wonder why General Jimetil,

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,080
who fled the country because of the
revolution, would give up so easily?

25
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:13,455
The Applicant Wants to Be a
Traditional Japanese Woman?!
Mokkori can Overcome National Boundaries
(Part 2)

26
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,069
The coup d'etat in the
Pamela Republic concluded

27
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,238
when General Jimetil escaped
from the country.

28
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,973
He forced the people of the Pamela
Republic to obey him

29
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,602
by using the power of military
dictatorship and terrorism.

30
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,313
The Home Secretary Mr. Williams has
been elected as the representative

31
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,384
of the revolutionary government.
Mr. Williams has declared the start

32
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,410
of democracy in the country, and
he is welcomed by many people.

33
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,587
Dad, I'm glad you are safe.

34
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,493
I'm happy for you, Misa.

35
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,360
Thanks. Now, our people can live peacefully.

36
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,666
General Jimetil targeted you as a hostage

37
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,069
to stop your father from proceeding
with the revolution, didn't he?

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,372
I didn't want to be a burden on him so...

39
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,704
That's why you came to Japan.

40
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,649
Well, now, you can relax and enjoy Japan.

41
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,116
Let's start over, and I will be your guide.

42
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:08,154
As I planned, hotels in Shinjuku would
be the best sightseeing spots.

43
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:08,950
What?

44
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,220
I knew exactly what you would say.
You're dead.

45
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:19,954
Damn, Kaori, you keep doing the same
thing again and again!

46
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,444
You have only one mission.

47
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:39,752
No matter what you do, you have to
bring William's daughter to me.

48
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,719
Understood?

49
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,751
General Jimetil of the Pamela Republic,

50
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,754
who went missing after the revolution,

51
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,382
is suddenly in Japan with a few followers.

52
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,860
According to an announcement from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,296
he stopped by Japan on his way
to exile in another country,

54
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,924
and the Japanese government gave
him permission to stay for a week.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,299
A runaway general?
He's really petty, isn't he?

56
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,136
We had better be careful.

57
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:38,401
Why? He can't do anything now, and
he doesn't have many followers.

58
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:43,180
I doubt that. Anyway, he came to Japan
where Misa is. That means...

59
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,844
The first attack has been completed.

60
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,648
Roger.

61
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,726
They sure did put on a show.

62
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,621
General Jimetil?

63
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,788
Look.

64
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,835
It's strange. There are no cars on the road.

65
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,508
When did they start the construction there?

66
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,545
There are too many people for just
simple construction, and also,

67
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,013
look what they're carrying.

68
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,310
Everyone has a gun.

69
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,381
The phone line has been cut.

70
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,852
I guess they have totally occupied this area.

71
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,402
Stop! Stop!

72
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,415
What's the matter?

73
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,951
A gas leak has been reported near here.
It's very dangerous

74
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,079
and the residents in this area have
been ordered to evacuate.

75
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,311
So are you.

76
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,618
Sure, I will.

77
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,866
That policeman, he's carrying a CZ75.

78
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,498
No sound, this means my guess is right.

79
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,883
Hello, this is Saeko Nogami.

80
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,613
Can you help me? Ryo is in danger.

81
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,379
Go!

82
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,320
Here they are.

83
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,433
Ryo!

84
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,767
Misa is their target. If the situation
gets worse don't overdo it.

85
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,066
I'm going to go and take out
some of those guys.

86
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,637
Damn! This is endless.

87
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,102
What was that explosion?

88
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,648
It was very close, wasn't it, Ryo?

89
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,844
Kaori! What the hell is that?

90
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,781
I'm going to fight too. I can't let you
be in danger by yourself.

91
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,113
Fight? Excuse me, but...

92
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,508
Idiot! Stop! Are you trying to
demolish my house? That's it!

93
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,007
What the hell is going on here?

94
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,298
Wow, Umibozu!

95
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,699
There's Saeko too.

96
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,360
Ryo, hurry up and get in the car!

97
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,108
Ryo!

98
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:36,904
Okay!

99
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,144
Let's go, Umibozu!

100
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,414
Don't let them go! Fire, fire!

101
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,190
Hold on!

102
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,512
Saeko!

103
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,953
I'm fine. Hurry up and go, Ryo!

104
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,888
Saeko!

105
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,396
Umibozu, go.

106
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,500
Ryo?!

107
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,558
Hurry up.

108
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,837
Damn! What people!

109
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,192
Ms. Saeko was captured because of me.

110
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,729
Ryo, I didn't know you were
such a cruel man!

111
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,099
I know she'll be all right.

112
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,868
She's their trump card in order to get Misa.

113
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,074
But even if you say so...

114
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,479
Leave Saeko to me. I promise I'll rescue her.

115
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,384
Then I'm going to make her pay me back
all the debts she owes me.

116
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,124
You jerk!

117
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,093
No violence, Kaori!

118
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,560
Die!

119
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,233
Damn! He's lost his mind.

120
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,793
Do you really think so?

121
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,402
He's a serious man.
He's more serious than us.

122
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,403
But...

123
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,943
Damn! You haven't found William's
daughter yet, have you?!

124
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,756
I don't want to hear any excuses!
Hurry up and find her!

125
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,756
Damn! They're all idiots!

126
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,256
It's not good for you to be irritated like that.

127
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,264
Who are you?

128
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,929
I'm the man who is taking care of
the woman you're looking for.

129
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:26,443
Don't get upset. I'm not here to kill you.
I came to make a deal.

130
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,447
A deal?

131
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,913
Yes, I know you have one of my friends.

132
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,377
That police woman? Sure.

133
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,127
However, I'm gonna pick the meeting
place for the exchange.

134
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,321
Fine.

135
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,810
Your meal.

136
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,615
She's not here!

137
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,980
Hi, here I am.

138
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,541
This place...

139
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,054
What's the matter? Don't you want
to run away from here?

140
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,267
Odaiba?

141
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,827
The little isolated island in Tokyo Bay?

142
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,964
But you won't let Misa go there, will you?

143
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,712
I understand. You want me to
go there as Misa, don't you?

144
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,179
You're the only one who can do this.
Will you?

145
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,652
My life has been yours since
I became your partner.

146
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,495
Sorry.

147
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,997
No way!

148
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:25,793
Misa...

149
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,534
I'm sorry I heard your conversation,

150
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,264
but I don't want to cause
you any more trouble.

151
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,106
No, it's not like that.

152
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,698
Yes, it is.

153
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,210
I'm going.

154
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,677
This is my problem.

155
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,572
I understand. You're going then.

156
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,245
Ryo! No way!

157
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,244
Please, if something happened to you,
Kaori, because of me,

158
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,689
I couldn't live with myself.

159
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:55,655
Misa! Okay, but I am going with you.

160
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,542
Umibozu!

161
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,635
Where are you going without me?

162
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,243
This is a dangerous mission
so I didn't want to ask you.

163
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,709
I was hired by Saeko, not you.

164
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,987
You're crooked, aren't you?

165
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,046
Why don't you just say you want to help me?

166
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,492
Same to you. Why don't you
just ask for help?

167
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,686
Welcome, both of you. You're very
courageous. This way.

168
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,728
Stop, this is the place. Don't move.

169
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,616
Hey, Saeko, are you all right?

170
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,923
Ryo! Why are you here?!

171
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,195
A short greeting is better.

172
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,322
Now, deal. Listen.

173
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,230
Let the woman and the girl start
walking at the same time.

174
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,033
Go.

175
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,193
Now.

176
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,047
Ryo!

177
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,446
Let me go!

178
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,693
What?

179
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,854
What's the matter? Fire! Fire!

180
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,058
Hey, he's saying fire!

181
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,272
What idiots! Where are you aiming?!

182
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,432
Who the hell?

183
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:27,677
Your hide-and-seek bodyguards must all
be sleeping. Right, Umibozu?

184
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,041
They sure are. It was mere
child's play for me.

185
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,991
What the hell?!

186
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,461
Damn! How dare you do that to my men?!

187
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,725
You will die!

188
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,492
This is the right way to fire a gun.

189
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,732
Idiot, that was my bullet.

190
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,332
Hey, no way. I'm the one who hit him.

191
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,641
I did too. The bullet from my rifle
is the one that hit him.

192
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,212
What the hell are you talking about?!

193
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,381
What the hell are you saying?
Mine was the first!

194
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,643
Throw down your guns, both of you.

195
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,186
Stuff happens. Let's do as he says.

196
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,287
No, I won't!

197
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,356
Hey, what are you going to do
if Misa is shot?

198
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,622
I don't care. If I give up my gun,
we're the ones who'll get shot.

199
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,658
I can't believe you are a human being!

200
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,597
I am Umibozu.

201
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,134
What the hell are you saying?
Something is really wrong with you.

202
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,969
You're the one saying something wild.

203
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,305
That's what you think, but
I'm telling the truth.

204
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,602
Liar.

205
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,175
Wait!

206
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,284
You see, that was my bullet!

207
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,911
No, that was mine!

208
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,622
Your mind's been really twisted
recently, hasn't it?

209
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,524
I said it's mine and it's mine!

210
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,758
Anyway, you're wrong.

211
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,528
I hate it when you are like that and...

212
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,018
Damn!

213
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,037
I'm not running away. This is just
a temporary withdrawal.

214
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,041
Hey, I think you had better come back here.

215
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,305
Oh well, I tried to stop him.

216
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,741
Damn, after I reform my troops,
I will be back and I'll kill them!

217
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,497
He should have listened to my advice.
Right, Umibozu?

218
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,505
I did it.

219
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,200
Okay, I understand.

220
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,378
I was going to return as a dictator,

221
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,346
and my plan was destroyed by those idiots.

222
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,224
Thank you for everything, Mr. Saeba.

223
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,658
No, I have to say thank you.

224
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,764
I was able to rescue Saeko
and we nailed Jimetil.

225
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,356
It was all because of you.

226
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,503
You thought you could sacrifice
yourself for Saeko.

227
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,836
It proves that you are a respectable, mature
woman, a traditional Japanese lady.

228
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,737
Really?

229
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,879
No matter where you were born,
no matter where you live,

230
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,975
half of your blood is from Japan.
Don't forget it.

231
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,144
Mr. Saeba, I...

232
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,019
Can you come to my country?

233
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,385
Oh, of course!

234
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,529
What the hell is this?! Kaori?!

235
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,770
I couldn't stop worrying about you guys,
and things are exactly as I thought.

236
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,143
Please take this off of me!

237
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,152
Misa! Take care!

238
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,068
Mr. Saeba, you didn't come.

239
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,350
I understand, Mr. Saeba.

240
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,758
There are still many people who need you.

241
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,585
Goodbye.

242
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,042
Ryo, are you really sure that was the right
thing to do, not going with her?

243
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,981
As long as there are people who need me,

244
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,449
I can't leave this country.

245
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,386
Oh, really? That's good to know.

246
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,723
We don't want to export our national
shame to the world.

247
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,747
Indeed!

248
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,926
Saeko, I know you need me, don't you?

249
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,366
What the hell did you just do to me?!
I definitely don't need you!

250
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,494
Wait, you national shame mokkori pervert!

251
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:33,015
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no

259
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,192
Don't you, don't you know

Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

263
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:42,754
There're look-a-likes in the world,
aren't there? A pervert like you, Ryo.

264
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,523
Don't talk about me being in the same
category as an old man like him.

265
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,690
But you're exactly the same.

266
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,559
I don't feel good. I'm going to be out.

267
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,728
Wait! You're already on the ship.

268
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,063
Mr. Ryonosuke's precious
wines are in danger.

269
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,267
I don't care. Kaori, he likes you,
so why don't you protect them?

270
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,428
You're going to run away, aren't you?
You cold-blooded jerk!

271
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,004
City Hunter 2:

272
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,807
"Kaori Takes a Great Active Role!
Cheers With the Memorial Wine"

273
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,105
If you don't watch it, someone
will peep at your panties.

274
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,144
Please look forward to the next episode
