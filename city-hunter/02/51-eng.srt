1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,235
Ryo, I'm doing something
and can't answer it.

14
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,702
Can you get it?

15
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,874
Hello, Saeba Company.

16
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,876
Oh, Reika.

17
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,210
I can go on a date with you, but for
anything else, I'm busy, so no.

18
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,779
Mokkori date?!

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,954
Sure, yes, I'll go.

20
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,947
I'd go anywhere even through fire
or water if you ask me out!

21
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,227
I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,630
Then, tonight at 7 PM, in the lounge
of the New City Hotel.

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,665
Don't dress up like a geek.

24
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,690
Mood is important to a woman.

25
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,070
Trust me.

26
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,139
I'll have a white tux with a black collar,

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,574
and I'll bring you to mokkori heaven.

28
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,309
Good, I look forward to seeing you.

29
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,607
Can I talk to Kaori?

30
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:30,316
Kaori, Kaori, you have a
phone call from Reika.

31
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,783
Me?

32
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,486
Yes, Ma'am.

33
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,477
I'm passing you the phone now.

34
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,350
What's making him happy like that?

35
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,799
Hey, Kaori, do you know the House of
Prophecy, on the edge of 3-Chome?

36
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,063
The House of Prophecy? No.

37
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,071
I see. It's that good?

38
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,274
Yes, there's usually a long line to get in.

39
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,572
Their love prophecies are especially perfect!


40
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,979
Really? Well, I'm not really interested
in that kind of thing,

41
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,948
but I might go, since you told me.

42
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,783
If you go, a good time to go today
would be at 5 o'clock.

43
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,978
It's not so crowded at that time. Bye.

44
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:15,016
Crystal Prophecy!
Chains of Memory Reviving in Kaori

45
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:25,660
The House of Prophecy

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,514
Come in.

47
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,069
Well, I came because I heard that
your predictions are good.

48
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,340
Kaori Makimura, your birthday is March 31st.

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,900
How do you know me?

50
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,315
I can see. I certainly see you.

51
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,479
Your figure.

52
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,417
Strong, very strong reaction!

53
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,323
Oh, poor baby.

54
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:28,198
You were born under such
an unfortunate star!

55
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,297
You tempt the people around you
to the edge of death.

56
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,606
Why?

57
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,598
Why do you think I tempt people
around me to a place like that?

58
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,145
Scorpions are jumping around.

59
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,080
Three red scorpions are jumping
around a rabbit.

60
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,042
I guess this rabbit is you.

61
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:49,555
Oh, a lion jumps into the scene
to rescue you.

62
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,023
This is a masquerade!

63
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,560
Three red scorpions...

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,229
A lion who saves me...

65
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,856
A masquerade...

66
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,233
This is about that time.

67
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,604
The red scorpions are the three
siblings from that time,

68
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,596
and the lion that jumped into the scene is...

69
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,338
Ryo!

70
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,177
If you move, it will get tighter.

71
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,053
Ryo Saeba, this match is postponed!

72
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,789
Next time, you die! Never forget that!

73
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,256
Ryo!

74
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,996
I was kidnapped, and in order to rescue me,

75
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,763
Ryo snuck onto the Lodos Mafia
ship docked in Tokyo Bay.

76
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,761
By himself, he fought each of the
three siblings to their death.

77
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,606
There!

78
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,729
Damn!

79
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,820
What?!

80
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,194
You... Saeba!

81
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,250
Why did you help me?

82
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,088
I wonder?

83
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,773
When this coin hits the floor,
the contest is on.

84
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,605
Ryo!

85
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,527
I guess I do usually put Ryo in danger.

86
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,825
Not only that.

87
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:22,467
I guess you don't realize it,
but I can see much more.

88
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,006
Yoo-hoo! Ryo's here!

89
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,641
How have you been, Miki?

90
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,242
Ah, wait...

91
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,611
Wow, how cute and smooth those hands are!

92
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,078
Can I eat them?

93
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,751
What the hell did you do to me,
you octopus jerk?!

94
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,686
You're on the way back from
a funeral, aren't you?

95
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,281
Funeral? Excuse me, but this
is called a tuxedo!

96
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,760
First of all, there are no
white funeral clothes!

97
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,888
Well, I guess an octopus doesn't
need to wear clothes like this!

98
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,732
What did you say?!

99
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,324
Cut it out, Falcon!

100
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,695
Saeba, you'd look better if you behaved
more like your nice outfit.

101
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,602
It's useless. No matter what he wears,
he's a mokkori pervert!

102
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,839
That's fine! Mokkori is my life!

103
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,039
I'm going out for a mokkori date
with Reika now.

104
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,843
Well, I guess you're absolutely right, Falcon.

105
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,927
A poor rabbit is repeatedly kidnapped

106
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,124
and she leads the lion to the edge of death.

107
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,899
She's right.

108
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:34,729
A friend of mine, Chiemi, a flight attendant,
was involved in an incident.

109
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:39,071
I told Ryo that I would protect her
by myself, however,

110
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,973
in the end, I was kidnapped
and Ryo saved me.

111
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:45,943
Kaori!

112
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:16,949
Chiemi!

113
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,250
After that there was Shinji, who received
his missing uncle's inheritance.

114
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,423
I was kidnapped by Shinji's aunt who
was trying to get the inheritance,

115
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,981
and I was saved by Ryo again.

116
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,984
Be good.

117
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,910
Then there was that time with
the artist, Ms. Haruka.

118
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,203
Watch me, you mokkori jerk!

119
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:10,536
Then, Kenichi Kashiwagi, who was
a witness for the prosecution,

120
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,571
was actually Ms. Keiko,

121
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,374
and I was jealous of her and
ran away from home.

122
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,742
Then, I was kidnapped again.

123
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,378
That time, I put not only Ryo,
but also Ms. Keiko in danger.

124
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,446
Hey, say something!
That time, I put not only Ryo,
but also Ms. Keiko in danger.

125
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,105
Hey, say something!

126
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,102
Freeze!

127
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,638
I'm sure that you're unlucky as now
you have to deal with me.

128
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,108
Well, I won't kill you today.

129
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,906
I might need you to testify as a witness.

130
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,743
That's right. Every time I was kidnapped,

131
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,684
Ryo rescued me no matter what
dangerous situation it put him in.

132
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,254
Indeed, this rabbit is a fiend incarnate,
a messenger from Hell,

133
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,746
to make the lion fall into
the bottomless pit.

134
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,937
Now, there's a huge bear blocking
the way of the lion.

135
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,632
It's too powerful and different from
all previous enemies.

136
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,378
But how brave he is!

137
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:30,371
No matter how many times he falls,
he's desperate to rescue the rabbit.

138
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,054
The lion's body is quickly turning red,
the color of his own blood!

139
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,284
Stop! That's enough!

140
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,419
That's too much.

141
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:44,296
I know that I'm only a drag on Ryo.

142
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,926
However, I haven't been worried because
he is incredibly strong.

143
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,265
I believed that Ryo is immortal.

144
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,408
I see, but all living things must die someday.

145
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:06,312
If I'm not around him, the lion
won't die, will he?

146
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,254
Exactly.


147
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,850
This time, the lion isn't going to win,
not even fate can save him.

148
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,792
However...

149
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,496
However, what? Tell me!

150
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,431
Is there any other way?

151
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,501
There is one thing, only one thing.

152
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,264
What is it? Please tell me!

153
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:31,269
Go to the top of the Tower of Babel,
and pray intently.

154
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,546
If your voice reaches God,

155
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:38,506
a white lion with black hair will be sent
to you. Evidence that you were heard.

156
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:44,988
Celebrate the revival of the bloody lion
with champagne.

157
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,488
At the Tower of Babel, champagne...

158
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,136
Reika, you sound happy. Has something
good happened to you?

159
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,840
With Ryo?

160
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,146
Hey, no matter what I say,
you'd tell this to Kaori?!

161
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,547
You dirty jerk!

162
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,716
Don't say such disrespectable things!

163
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,985
This is for the world, for the people!

164
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,989
I see. I never thought that you were
unworthy to be my friend!

165
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,359
I refuse to be the friend of
a mokkori man like you.

166
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
I see!

167
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:26,465
Then I'm going to tell Miki everything
shameful that you've been hiding.

168
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,467
What? What is it, Saeba?

169
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,237
What shameful things has Falcon
been hiding from me?

170
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,340
There's nothing like that!
Don't believe him!

171
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,841
It's all bullshit!

172
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,672
I see, bullshit?

173
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,714
Then, you don't remember the time
you put panties on your head?

174
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,282
Panties?

175
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,817
On his head?

176
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,584
Yes, those panties belonged to
a girl named Sakura.

177
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,795
Sakura, jealous of Miki, who was marrying
Sakura's brother, ran away.

178
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,999
Miki asked me to find Sakura
and bring her back.

179
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,001
It's a rare occasion for you
to be cool like this.

180
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,628
Well, once in a while.

181
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,811
But Sakura was already involved
in the incident.

182
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,851
I finally got her back and
in order to secure her,

183
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,388
I asked you, Umibozu, to let her
stay at your place.

184
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,622
I don't remember that. Really?

185
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,089
Yes, really.



186
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,528
I don't want to let you live,

187
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,429
but I don't want the ladies to see
such a cruel scene.

188
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:37,836
Anyway, this dirty jerk followed
her to the bath.

189
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,372
He made Sakura put her panties on his head,

190
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:45,537
and he was so happy and excited
that he passed out.

191
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,948
I did it!

192
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,779
It's a lie!

193
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,876
Indeed, what a great job.
Even I can't do that.

194
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,356
I see, Falcon did that.

195
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,561
No way! I didn't do it. She did it herself!


196
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,929
That's not all!

197
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:09,094
He's been saying that he's a professional
living in a hard world, but it's absurd!

198
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,508
How about the incident with
the actress Yumiko Sato?!

199
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,279
You made an appearance as her cool killer.

200
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,042
Well, everything up until then was good.

201
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,392
It's no good! I can't do it!

202
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,734
His ghost is coming to take you to Hell!


203
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,282
Now, shoot the ghost!

204
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,876
Stop! Stop, Keiichi!

205
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,599
But see what happened.

206
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,803
All those were setups for Yumiko
to make her recovery.

207
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,671
He's a huge fan of Yumiko Sato.

208
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,878
And also, what about Maki Himuro?

209
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,880
Even though he needed to protect her,

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,678
he disguised himself shamefully
so many times, shame on you!

211
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,931
Maki, let's go over there!

212
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,644
Mr. Saeba, what was that?!

213
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:24,136
Then, on top of that, he finally
cornered the target,

214
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,039
but he got into a tough situation
because he's afraid of cats.

215
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,939
It was difficult for me to see him like that.

216
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,975
Just look at you.

217
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,083
Bastard, how did you know my weakness?

218
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,489
The most incredible was when you climbed
on the statue of Hachikou

219
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,514
holding a Barbie doll.

220
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,492
I didn't know you were such a pervert.

221
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,962
Miki, I think you should give him up
as soon as possible.

222
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,645
Jerk! Come outside and fight!

223
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,781
Don't worry, Falcon. I don't care
about what he said,

224
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,078
because I love you.

225
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,654
So, don't get so excited like that.

226
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:20,887
Gee, look at them. I think I'll hurry
and mokkori with Reika!

227
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,120
Saeba's most important thing in life
really is mokkori, isn't it?

228
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,332
Ryo, where are you going all
dressed up like that?

229
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,037
Saeko!

230
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,062
I wonder if it's okay for you to
fool around like that?

231
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:38,400
Before you tell me what to do, I want you
to pay me back completely.

232
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,880
Kaori has put her nose into
something very dangerous.

233
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,077
If you don't hurry up and save her,
it might become life-threatening.

234
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,987
I don't care. She's a mature woman.

235
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,012
I can't get involved in everything she does.

236
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,550
I am going to mokkori with Reika,
so don't interrupt me!

237
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,200
Oh, boy.

238
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:40,968
Kaori!

239
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:42,669
Ryo?!

240
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,546
A white lion with black hair!

241
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,489
If your voice reaches God,

242
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:01,220
a white lion with black hair
will be sent to you.

243
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,495
Are you all right, Kaori?!

244
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,330
Yes, what's the matter, Ryo?

245
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,898
You are holding a gun, aren't you?

246
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,924
What? You're asking, what's the matter?

247
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,239
I didn't expect you to come here, Ryo,

248
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,731
because the old fortuneteller didn't tell me.

249
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,407
Old fortuneteller?

250
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:25,350
Geez, even though he spouted a lot of
nonsense, he chose Kaori after all.

251
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,581
Yes, he did. I was dumped completely.

252
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:34,826
Well, if he had come to me, I would have
just slapped him around anyway.

253
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,130
Well, you planned all these
big stories, didn't you?

254
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,724
Because I'm irritated by them.

255
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,635
Now, Reika, why don't we go out for a drink?

256
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,903
On you, sister?

257
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,370
On Ryo.

258
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,008
Damn, Saeko and Reika did this.

259
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,475
Here, Ryo.

260
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,346
I brought champagne.

261
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,576
Let's drink it together and look at
the beautiful night scenery.

262
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,082
I guess so. Let's cheer the old fortuneteller.

263
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,621
Cheers!

264
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,669
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

265
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,366
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

266
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:27,268
But I couldn't do so

267
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:37,780
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

268
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:44,184
You don't know the reason I'm here

269
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:59,111
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

270
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,478
I wouldn't have let you go

271
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:10,753
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

272
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:16,994
Everyday life is starting

273
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:27,271
In my mind, time has stopped

274
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:33,611
And a double-decker bus is passing

275
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,821
Here comes the woman who said
she is Kaori's sister,

276
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,322
but I'm going to keep quiet
about her for a while.

277
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,558
Hey, who is Ms. Sayuri?

278
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,460
Isn't she suspicious because
Saeko introduced her?

279
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,930
Don't worry. She's been receiving
ransom notes at work, I've heard.

280
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,799
Is this a real job then?

281
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,767
Why don't you guard Sayuri?

282
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,270
Can I? Good! I'll do my best!

283
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,604
City Hunter 2:

284
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,341
"Reunion After Twenty Years! Please Look
After My Sister, Mr. Saeba. (Part 1)"

285
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,968
If you miss it, I can't meet her!

286
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,145
Please look forward to the next episode
