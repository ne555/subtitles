00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,099
I am Kozue Makihara, twelve years old.

14
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,535
I've been admiring Mr. Saeba and
Ms. Kaori for a long time.

15
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,938
Kozue's older sister is my type.
A mokkori beauty!

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,939
Cut it out!

17
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,908
I thought you went to visit Kozue
whose lower body is disabled.

18
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:49,742
Yes, Ma'am.

19
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,712
Mr. Saeba really is a private detective.

20
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,944
He protected me completely when
I was attacked by a strange man.

21
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,920
This place is dangerous, so why don't
you come to my apartment?

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,684
Wow! I'm with Mr. Saeba all the time.

23
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,288
If this is a dream, don't wake me up!

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,320
Wanting to Fall in Love Just Like a Dream

25
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,180
Mr. Saeba!

26
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,350
Yuka's thigh!

27
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,087
Idiot!

28
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,029
Mr. Saeba!

29
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,159
What's the matter now, Kozue?

30
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,959
Oh, no, just like a dream.

31
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,841
Really, just like a nightmare.

32
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,716
This is the first time that I've enjoyed
an exciting morning like this.

33
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,961
I'm so happy to be here like this

34
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,986
that I almost forgot that someone
is trying to kill me.

35
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,230
I wish this morning would last forever.

36
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,536
Well, I have to go. Please take care of Kozue.

37
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,305
See you later.

38
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,406
See you.

39
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,839
Bye.

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,203
But the fun days when I feel like their sister

41
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,482
will disappear soon just like that cloud.


42
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,248
What's with you making a big sigh like that?

43
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,791
I know. You're worried about
your sister, aren't you?

44
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,564
Ryo is trying to get Ms. Yuka.

45
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,632
Trying to get?

46
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,101
Yes, you saw him this morning, didn't you?

47
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,638
Really, he hits on women that
are his type all the time.

48
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,105
His type?

49
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,641
Do you mean Mr. Saeba likes my sister?


50
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,273
Well, I guess so.

51
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,751
Well, basically, he likes anyone
who is beautiful.

52
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
That's it!

53
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,713
Yes, that's it! In order to continue
this enjoyable life,

54
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,117
my sister and Mr. Saeba could get married!

55
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,765
However, my sister would have
to like Mr. Saeba,

56
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,131
and my sister's type is...

57
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,097
Sincere and gentle, and has
to be strong and reliable.

58
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,605
And also not lewd. That's
definitely important.

59
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,704
I hate lewd people as much
as cockroaches.

60
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,282
Strong Not Lewd Gentle Sincere




61
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,184
Strong Not Lewd Gentle Sincere
That's the biggest problem for sure!

62
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,153
Strong Not Lewd Gentle Sincere
I have to remove the lewd
things around Mr. Saeba.







63
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,388
Let's see, I think there is
something in here...

64
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,296
Here they are!

65
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:09,464
I saw these with my telescope and I know
where he hides his dirty books.

66
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:19,415
If my sister finds out that he has these,
it's going to be a problem.

67
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,021
So heavy!

68
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,457
Anyway, how large is his collection? Really!

69
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,664
Where is it?! It's gone and gone and gone!


70
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,690
All of them are gone!

71
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,671
Ryo, what's the matter?


72
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:43,199
Kaori! What did you do with
my valuable collections?!

73
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,511
Did you throw them away?

74
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,046
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,047
Don't play dumb!

76
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:52,051
Dirty books in the speakers,
dirty posters under the sofa,

77
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:56,886
X-rated mokkori video tapes, dirty books
behind the picture frame.

78
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,620
Where did you put them?

79
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,291
I see. I didn't know you had
things hidden there.

80
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,426
From now on, I'll be checking.

81
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,900
No way?

82
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,829
You really didn't know?

83
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,733
Oh, boy, I'm so sorry!

84
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,909
It's strange.

85
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,685
What is this? It can't be...

86
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,762
Kaori, you threw them away,
just as I thought!

87
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,526
I said, I didn't know!

88
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,398
Damn, he already found them.

89
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:46,005
Damn! I'm going to hide them somewhere
nobody will be able to find them!

90
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,472
I said, I didn't know!

91
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,274
I'm home.

92
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,378
Mr. Saeba, how was Kozue today?

93
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,508
Well, nothing happened and
it's been very peaceful.

94
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,092
Mr. Saeba, what are those?!

95
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,335
Well, these are,

96
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,635
I thought these might be useful for
sex education for Ms. Kozue.

97
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,715
No excuse seems to work.

98
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,149
No matter what, he was
found to be a pervert.

99
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,017
This is the worst possible result.

100
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,825
In that case, the only thing left is to
show his strength to my sister,

101
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,986
and hide his lewd side.

102
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,918
But how?

103
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,716
When I show those fake cockroaches
to my sister,

104
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,911
she'll scream and run around to escape.

105
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,186
Then, Mr. Saeba will come to rescue her.

106
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,356
Hey, sister, look at your foot!

107
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,687
Cockroaches, aren't they?

108
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,275
A bunch of cockroaches!

109
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,335
Following me!

110
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:39,281
Why are they following me? Only me?

111
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,109
What's the matter, Yuka?

112
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,414
Mr. Saeba, help me!

113
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,925
What's the matter?

114
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,229
No!

115
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,696
Yuka?!

116
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,201
Was Mr. Saeba in the bath?

117
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,863
What's the matter? What's going on, Kozue?

118
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,238
Yuka, wait!

119
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,607
Help me!
Yuka, wait!

120
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,642
Yuka, wait!

121
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,904
No!

122
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,013
You jerk, Ryo!

123
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,982
Have you completely lost your morality?!

124
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,551
Punishment from God!

125
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,618
Mace 1
Punishment from God!

126
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,587
Mace 1

127
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,128
What's happening?

128
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,944
Ms. Yuka, are you okay?

129
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,583
What are these? These aren't cockroaches!

130
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,141
Cockroaches?

131
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,245
Just some pieces of black paper,
stuck to my slippers.

132
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,913
Who did a mischievous thing like that?

133
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,186
The person who knows that I really
hate cockroaches is...

134
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,452
Oh, no, a cockroach!

135
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,433
It's all right, sister. I'm here with you!

136
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,635
Kozue! Tell me, why did you do this?!


137
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,605
It's a long story.

138
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,344
I'm so sorry!

139
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,572
Thank you very much, Mr. Saeba.

140
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,841
I enjoyed going for a walk
after such a long while.

141
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,106
Starting tonight, you're going to
stay at the hospital,

142
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,938
so you should breathe some
fresh air in town.

143
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,521
What's the matter, Kaori?

144
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,326
Ryo! There's a strange man
in front of the apartment.

145
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,793
What?

146
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,373
Who are you?

147
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,643
You're around my place in the
middle of the day like this.

148
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,980
Ouch, let me go. I am...

149
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,140
Officer!

150
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,551
Officer?

151
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:29,647
Yes, he was the officer in charge of the
incident when Kozue was shot.

152
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,061
This is a big problem.

153
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,359
I told you when the schedule of
the surgery was confirmed,

154
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,221
you had to let the police
know where you'd be.

155
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,192
But why do you need to know?

156
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,372
Listen!

157
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,609
The bullet, a very important piece of
evidence, is in her body.

158
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,778
Which means, if something happens
to her before the surgery,

159
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,047
it will be a big problem.

160
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,073
Actually, I've heard that she was
attacked by someone.

161
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,853
I see.

162
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,122
You think the guy who attacked Kozue
and the criminal who shot her

163
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,784
have some kind of important connection?

164
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,593
What?

165
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,395
No, not like that.

166
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,363
The criminal has already been arrested.

167
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,696
But that person hasn't admitted to what
he's accused of, has he?

168
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,635
Also, it hasn't been confirmed

169
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,604
that the gun he was carrying is the
same one used to shoot Kozue.

170
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,601
There's a possibility that someone
else actually shot Kozue.

171
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,768
Someone might be in trouble if the bullet
was removed from her body.

172
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,682
What are you talking about?

173
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,616
The attack and that incident are unrelated!

174
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:42,419
Anyway, an amateur like you should
stay out of this matter.

175
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,663
But...

176
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,832
Listen to me! This is an order
from the authorities.

177
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,299
Wait!

178
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,872
The person who should withdraw
is you, Mr. Iwadate.

179
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,433
Ms. Nogami, why are you here?

180
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,146
The size of the team investigating
that incident was reduced

181
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,748
and you were removed from the team.

182
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,215
What are you doing?

183
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,208
Well, I was the person in charge
at that time so...

184
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,223
What a hard worker you are!

185
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,522
However, I'm the person currently in charge.

186
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,628
That's right.

187
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,365
I've been in contact with the police

188
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,028
and Detective Nogami already knew
that I was guarding her.

189
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,514
He's the one who shot Ms. Kozue?

190
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,487
Yes...

191
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,689
We found out that he has a secret
connection with a gang

192
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,055
as we continued the investigation.

193
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,795
We confirmed that he has been
in trouble with the gang

194
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,730
because of his financial problems.

195
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,539
But there is no concrete evidence
that he was the shooter.

196
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,550
If there is any evidence, it can only be...

197
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,558
The bullet in Kozue's body.

198
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,651
After it is extracted tomorrow...

199
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,333
Kozue?

200
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,766
Kozue!

201
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,137
I didn't like that officer from the start.

202
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,771
His eyes are really scary.

203
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,847
I don't know why.

204
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,514
I've never felt scared like this before,

205
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,354
but I am scared about the surgery tomorrow.

206
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,926
Mr. Saeba, please stay here, be close to me.

207
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,740
What's wrong? There's nothing
to worry about.

208
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,901
Your knight is here with you.

209
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,086
Look at your face, Kozue,
what an unhappy face!

210
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,063
Don't worry too much.

211
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,930
Have a good dream while you're
having the operation.

212
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,570
When you wake up, everything will be fine.

213
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,594
Everything!

214
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,613
Damn!

215
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,215
Now it's impossible to attack the girl.

216
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,958
You're the doctor that will operate on
Kozue Makihara, aren't you?

217
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,730
I would like you to accept a present from me.

218
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,107
What is this?!

219
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:19,942
I want you to substitute this for the
bullet removed from her body.

220
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,481
No way, I can't do that.

221
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,316
I have to give the bullet to the police.

222
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,806
Shut up!

223
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,318
You don't want to die, do you, Doctor?

224
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,348
Doctor, it's ready.

225
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,926
I'll be right there.

226
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,528
Well, shall we go?

227
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,331
If you try something,

228
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,061
I'll shoot you, even in the middle
of the operation.

229
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,764
Operating

230
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,173
Doctor, who is he?

231
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,853
Well, he's a medical student.

232
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,378
I thought I would let him
observe this operation.

233
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,957
Nice to meet you.

234
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,874
Sorry!

235
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,842
What are you screaming about
during the surgery?

236
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,745
This patient touched my butt.

237
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,212
What?

238
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,950
The butt of a nurse is so nice, as I thought.

239
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,485
That voice!


240
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,952
Ah, a gun!

241
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,151
Doctor, who the hell is this man?!

242
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,559
Just as I thought.

243
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,762
You don't have any other way
to protect yourself

244
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,662
except to substitute a different bullet
during the operation.

245
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,067
Hi!

246
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,372
Are you surprised?

247
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,535
This is the disguise you used
when you attacked Kozue.

248
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,070
Detective Nogami found it in your room,

249
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,605
Detective lwadate.

250
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,506
You!

251
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,093
Damn!

252
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,194
Don't move, Saeba. I'm going to kill her.

253
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,638
Don't struggle.

254
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,373
You'd better surrender calmly.

255
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,035
Bullshit, I'm serious.

256
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,472
Please hurry and help me!

257
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,007
Be quiet. You should take care of it yourself.

258
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,514
Shoot, you didn't do as good
a job as you could.

259
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,067
You are...

260
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,167
This is the correct way to use
cutlery, Mr. Iwadate.

261
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,381
Nogami...

262
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,076
Now, thank you very much for your
cooperation, everybody.

263
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,924
Ms. Kozue is waiting for you
in the next operating room.

264
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,627
Please take good care of her.

265
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,726
Mr. Saeba, watch out!

266
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,066
Magnum Saeba Punch!

267
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,442
Saeba Python Kick!

268
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,251
Well, Kozue, you're fine now.

269
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,253
I finished all the bad guys.

270
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,720
Wow!

271
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,354
I love you, Mr. Saeba.

272
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,298
What?

273
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,632
Kozue?

274
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,726
You're awake. You did a good job.

275
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,133
The operation is over and it was
a big success, Kozue!

276
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,102
He was so cool, Mr. Saeba.

277
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:16,011
He beat up the bad guys in no time,
and told me I was fine.

278
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,351
Yes, that's true, but how did you know that?

279
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,319
The criminal was arrested by the police.

280
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,623
Really? Then my dream was true.

281
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,414
Dream?

282
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,493
I see.

283
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,631
Thanks to Mr. Saeba's efforts,

284
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,690
you were able to have the operation safely,

285
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,464
and the criminal was arrested.

286
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,705
Incredible!

287
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,640
Everything happened exactly the way
Mr. Saeba told me before the surgery.

288
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:47,543
He said that, while I was asleep,
everything would be settled.

289
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,272
He's great, Mr. Saeba.

290
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,987
Where's Mr. Saeba?

291
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,589
He said his part was done and
left a little while ago.

292
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,790
Oh, no.

293
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,159
What kind of face is that?

294
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,661
Of course he left.

295
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,356
There's no more danger.

296
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,198
I see.

297
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:10,464
After the problem is resolved,
I can't stay with Mr. Saeba.

298
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,504
Mr. Saeba!

299
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,275
Mr. Saeba!

300
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,185
From: Kozue Makihara
1-3-6, Nishiyama-Cho
Shinjuku, Tokyo

301
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,187
From: Kozue Makihara
1-3-6, Nishiyama-Cho
Shinjuku, Tokyo
Well, let's see...

302
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,176
From: Kozue Makihara
1-3-6, Nishiyama-Cho
Shinjuku, Tokyo

303
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,883
Do you have a lover?

304
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,220
I don't have just one.

305
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:44,094
Do you think that a woman fifteen years
younger than you could be your wife?

306
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,237
It doesn't look as much like a
letter as a questionnaire.

307
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,669
Yes, I don't care about the age difference.

308
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,671
I don't care if Mr. Saeba becomes
a middle-aged man.

309
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,519
When I grow up and I'm mature
enough to get married,

310
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,817
I will ask Mr. Saeba to marry me.

311
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:07,658
Then I'll enjoy an exciting life
like that with everybody.

312
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,663
Question Three:

313
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,498
Do you have a Lolita complex?

314
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,666
Guitar o kikase ta katta

315
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,468
What the hell is that?
Guitar o kikase ta katta

316
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,436
Well, I don't know.
Guitar o kikase ta katta

317
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,738
Well, I don't know.
Ai o todoke ta katta

318
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,137
Ai o todoke ta katta

319
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:27,034

Toki ga tomatta mama no boku no kokoro o

Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

328
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,588
Ryo, why do you think you can bring
a girl into our apartment?!

329
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,323
What? Who? This girl? Ah, yes!

330
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,492
Someone is trying to get Rumi,
so I'm protecting her.

331
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,326
No way, you liar.

332
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,096
But actually, we're involved in a big incident.

333
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,767
Do whatever you want. I'm going to quit
being your partner, so whatever.


334
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:00,138
Oh, she left! We'll finally see the
mysterious beauty Sarah.

335
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,373
City Hunter 2:

336
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,642
"Goodbye, Hard-Boiled City (Part 1)"

337
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,610
If you miss it, I'm going to leave.

338
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:09,636
Please look forward to the next episode
