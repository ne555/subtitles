13
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,070
You're so persistent! Don't follow me!

14
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,739
Don't run away from me.
Please wait! Wait for me!

15
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,310
Please listen to me. Please have
some tea with me.

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,513
No, find somebody else. Go away.

17
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,749
I'll give you good service
afterwards at a hotel.

18
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,875
I don't need it.

19
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,293
Oh, no!

20
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,284
Hey, hey, let's go to a hotel.

21
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,135
Oh, why is that mokkori hi-leg
woman in there?

22
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,632
Wait!

23
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,379
I can't believe he was tricked by this!

24
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,924
You tricked me! Why did you do that to me?!

25
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,654
I really hate men who chase
women like you do.

26
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:53,998
Proposal From a Seventeen-Year-Old
Suspicious Date Panic
(Part 1)

27
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:04,417
You want us to chase off the men who have
been stalking your granddaughter?

28
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,544
Yes, that's right.

29
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,652
However, before we make a deal, I'd like
to ask you an important question.

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,221
This girl, Kimiko, is a mokkori
beauty, isn't she?

31
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,962
Don't worry about that.

32
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,298
I've heard many rumors about you
and know you very well.

33
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,633
You don't guard women who aren't beautiful.

34
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,337
I like it! I like a man who has
a policy like that.

35
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,839
Oh, Mr. Takeda, you're a good partner.

36
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,641
I guess you also love women, don't you?

37
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,610
Oh, you can tell, can't you?

38
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,172
Kimiko's beautiful, and if she wasn't my
granddaughter, I would want her.

39
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,618
She's not very big, but she has
a very tight, mokkori body.

40
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,085
I see...

41
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,890
Kimiko, over here!

42
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,188
Grandpa, I'm sorry I'm late.

43
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,530
You!

44
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,326
You!

45
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:57,299
Good, you know each other? Then
we can save some time. Good.

46
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:02,229
I'm sorry. Grandpa has to stay in
the examining room for a bit.

47
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,278
Is there any other family?

48
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,907
My parents died in an accident soon
after I was born, I've been told.

49
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,215
An accident?

50
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,678
I don't know the details.

51
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,246
When I ask my Grandpa about it,
he doesn't want to talk about it.

52
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,058
Excuse me.

53
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,592
Cut it out! She's gone.

54
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,137
I don't like her.

55
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,040
She's cute, isn't she? She also
appears to be strong-willed.

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,667
I meant this job request.

57
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,841
Just to chase off a guy,

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,511
he wants me to stay here and guard her.

59
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,449
Indeed, Mr. Saeba.

60
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,327
Speaking honestly, Mr. Saeba,

61
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,997
I have something else to ask you,
apart from guarding Kimiko.

62
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,693
I want you to correct her feelings about men.

63
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:06,139
I'm worried that she won't be able
to marry if she doesn't change.


64
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,078
But she'll hate men even more if you
keep a man like this around her.

65
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,913
A man like this? Me?

66
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,984
No, I think that seeing Mr. Saeba,
a lame excuse of a man,

67
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,511
will actually improve her view of men.

68
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,590
Hey, old man! Are you joking?!

69
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,117
I'm serious. Can't you see that?

70
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,398
Is this Ms. Kimiko's late mother?

71
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,923
Yes, she died soon after giving birth.

72
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,404
Kimiko is my darling,

73
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,170
the only granddaughter left to me
by my daughter.

74
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,978
I want Kimiko to have a happy
married life in the future.

75
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,581
I can't stop thinking there's something wrong.

76
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,956
Pictures of Kimiko's father.
There weren't any, right?

77
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,823
No there weren't. I wonder why?

78
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,720
That sly old man is trying to
hide something from us.

79
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,513
The more I lower myself, the more
condescending that bitch gets.

80
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,814
I'm gonna get her no matter what it takes!

81
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,247
Hey, that sounds difficult. Can I help you?

82
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,550
Idiot, this is something that
you do by yourself.

83
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,428
Hey, if you talk loudly, someone might
find out what you're doing.

84
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,328
Are you going to stop me?!

85
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,397
Anyway, I don't think you'll
need a guard today.

86
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,578
I wish you were right, but...

87
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,775
What's with the attitude? It's not cute.

88
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,195
Hi, my honey, Kimiko. How are you?

89
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,231
How about this? A flower carpet just for you.


90
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,721
Now, let me take you to school.

91
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,702
What were you thinking?!

92
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,372
Red roses, the symbol of passion,
look good on you.

93
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,442
No! I can't believe you want me to
step on these beautiful flowers!

94
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,876
I really hate people like you!

95
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,672
Oh, no!

96
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,609
Hey, wait!

97
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,549
He looks like he's a very wealthy man.

98
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,250
Is he the one who wants to marry you?

99
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,582
Hey, is that the only one who
wants to marry her?

100
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:39,418
Hey, baby! I made a rock 'n' roll
song just for you. Listen!

101
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,628
Oh, Sarah,

102
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,137
I don't know who she is, but
everybody knows her name!

103
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,039
Is that another suitor?

104
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,506
I guess so...

105
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,345
Ms. Kimiko, please say yes today!

106
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,214
Please tell me that you'll marry me!

107
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,017
Take your dirty hands off of her!
I'm the one marrying Ms. Kimiko!

108
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,076
No, it has to be me!

109
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,627
Hey, let me go! Cut it out!

110
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,962
I'm gonna die if you don't marry me!

111
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,224
Please, Ms. Kimiko!

112
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,731
Hurry up and get in!

113
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,239
Ms. Kimiko!

114
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:40,151
Takeda
Clinic

115
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,889
I was really surprised. On the
way back from school,

116
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,224
there were a ton of people waiting for her.

117
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,326
I'd guess there were forty or fifty of them.

118
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,795
It sounds like she's a princess out of a myth.

119
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,664
But why?

120
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:56,669
Is your family rich, or did they win
the lottery or something?

121
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,170
No way.

122
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,740
Then why do all those people want to
marry a kid like you?

123
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,935
I don't know. I want to ask you
the same thing!

124
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,377
These last two weeks, men come one
after another, and I don't know why!

125
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,851
It makes you envious, doesn't it, Kaori?

126
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,253
Do you really want to die young?

127
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:14,878
No!

128
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,023
Old man!

129
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,759
Oh, Mr. Saeba, what is it?

130
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,853
Why don't you tell me the truth today?
No jokes.

131
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:28,199
There's a reason why those men are
attracted to her, isn't there?

132
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,265
Damn, I guess I have no choice.

133
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,367
Come this way.

134
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,576
Here!

135
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,844
There's a small hole here, see?

136
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,779
A hole?

137
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,337
You'll see what I mean when you look.

138
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,155
How about it? It's nice scenery, isn't it?

139
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,591
This is my secret.

140
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:56,460
I've kept it secret for a long time,
but you've finally discovered it.

141
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,695
No! The secret I want to know about
isn't a peeping hole!

142
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,643
What are you doing?! I thought you said
I was a kid and not attractive at all!

143
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,201
Peeping Tom! Pervert!

144
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,274
I was tricked again by that old fart.

145
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,979
He ran away so quickly!

146
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,825
What a mokkori pervert!

147
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,761
Now I can't even relax at home!
The situation is getting worse!

148
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,397
I need to do something about it.

149
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,957
A date?

150
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,905
If they think that I'm getting married,

151
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,305
they'll have no choice but to give up.

152
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,642
Tomorrow is Sunday.

153
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,410
So I'm sure that everything
will be settled tomorrow.

154
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,576
No way! I don't want to.

155
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,654
I don't want to do it either,
but there's no easier way!

156
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,155
I absolutely don't want to do it.

157
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,816
I see...

158
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,625
If you don't cooperate, I'll tell
Ms. Kaori what you did.

159
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:07,298
What?! Peeping at the bath?
You're such a sex offender! Pervert!

160
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,270
Yes, I'll do it.

161
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,762
Wow, that's so kind of you, Mr. Saeba!

162
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,913
Takeda
Clinic

163
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,112
You look so cute, Ms. Kimiko!

164
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,091
You get to go out with such a cute girl.

165
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,718
What a lucky guy!

166
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,925
A kid is a kid no matter what she wears.

167
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,459
Ms. Kaori, someone peeped on a
kid taking a bath last night...

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,735
Well, let's go, Kimiko!

169
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,636
Hey, both of you, when would be
the best day for the wedding?

170
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,304
Damn, what an old fart!

171
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,510
Mr. Saeba!

172
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,373
Don't you remember? We're engaged today.

173
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,713
Why don't you take my arm and escort me?

174
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,148
Hi, honey!

175
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,347
Here he comes.

176
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,625
Oh, what a nice day for us
to go out on a date.

177
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,116
Why don't you go out with me
for a drive, Ms. Kimiko?

178
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,521
Before I answer your question,
how do we look to you?

179
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,996
How do you look?

180
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,070
I get it! A Koala holding a big tree!

181
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,839
Who's a Koala?!

182
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,340
Listen to me very carefully.

183
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,570
This man is my fianc

184
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,044
Fianc

185
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,545
That can't be, Ms. Kimiko!

186
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,012
I can't believe it!

187
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,662
How long do they intend to follow us?

188
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,004
They don't believe that you're my real fianc

189
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,739
But I'm tired.

190
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,242
Your baby-milk smell might spread to me.

191
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,574
What? You mokkori pervert!

192
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,538
Damn! They look intimate!

193
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,274
They're showing off! Wait a sec!

194
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,088
I know that man! He's Mokkori Playboy Ryo!

195
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,690
He loves women so very much.

196
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,959
I'm sure a man like him could never
love just one woman.

197
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,757
On top of that, she's just a kid.

198
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,563
That means...

199
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,065
I have an idea.

200
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,839
Who are they, Ryo?

201
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,507
Don't complain.

202
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,609
This is the first time that your place
has ever been completely full

203
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,804
since you opened, isn't it?

204
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,714
How's it going? Were you able to
prepare exactly what I told you?

205
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,751
Sure, I arranged a special woman for him.

206
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,242
I'm sure that he'll show his true face soon.

207
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,395
Can I sit next to you?

208
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,731
Ah, yes! Ah, no...

209
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,201
Unfortunately, that seat is taken,
so please come this way.

210
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,838
Oh, then why don't you ask that girl to move?

211
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,841
Oh, I'm sorry, but this girl is with me.

212
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,977
Really? I'm sorry.

213
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,811
But for you, a mature woman
like me is more appropriate.

214
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,242
Oh, no! This must be a trick!

215
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:20,392
Hey, why don't you dump that girl
and have some fun with me?

216
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,294
Mr. Saeba!

217
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,464
I'm sorry, but this girl is really my fianc

218
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,201
To me, this girl is more attractive
than you are.

219
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,160
More attractive than me?!

220
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,303
I see. Sorry to disturb you!

221
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,277
No way, are they really engaged?

222
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,045
We don't have any choice except
to give up, do we?

223
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,049
No, I don't want to give up!
No way!
Damn!

224
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,223
Wow! This place emptied almost
instantly, didn't it?

225
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,427
Mr. Saeba?

226
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,931
I'm not stupid enough to fall
for a trick like that.

227
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,304
What? It's strange. There aren't
many people here.

228
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,305
Is there a problem?

229
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,707
I was asked by someone to come here
and to find a couple.

230
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,507
I was supposed to tempt the male of
the two in front of everybody.

231
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,519
Oh, no! I can't believe it!


232
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,492
Then that woman before...

233
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,588
The man Ryo Saeba has made
a fatal mistake!

234
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,699
What an unlucky guy I am!

235
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,168
A big chance like that doesn't
come that often!

236
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,534
I even wore special purpose
underwear today!

237
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,603
Hey, why are you mad at me like this?

238
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,111
You're the type of guy who
falls for another woman

239
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,881
even if you're already dating
someone, aren't you?

240
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,815
I didn't do anything like that, did I?

241
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,053
That's because you thought it was
a trick, wasn't it?

242
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,056
Yes, it was, however, I was able
to make those guys go away.

243
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,514
Thank you so very much about it,
but now it's over. Go home.

244
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,162
You're too optimistic.

245
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,364
Shut up! I said, go home!

246
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,831
Go home!

247
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,937
But please listen to me.

248
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,407
Shut up, I don't want to hear about it.

249
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,036
Tell that old woman we don't want to see her!

250
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,272
That old woman?

251
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,106
What a cranky old man!

252
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,958
That was some luxury car!

253
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,693
What could they have wanted?

254
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,251
Right, Mr. Saeba?

255
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,162
What?

256
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,900
What? You told Mr. Saeba to go home?

257
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,571
Yes, I did. Finally, I'll be able to
go back to my quiet life.

258
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,273
Idiot, why did you do that?

259
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,606
Grandpa, why are you sticking up
for Mr. Saeba?

260
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,407
Who was the visitor with that
luxury car a little while ago?

261
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,948
It has nothing to do with you.

262
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,803
What a surprise!

263
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:22,706
This mansion belongs to the head of the
Uesugi Zaibatsu, Takako Uesugi.

264
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,707
Then you just came home
without doing anything?

265
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:36,021
I'm so sorry, but that hardheaded
old man, Mr. Takeda was...

266
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,689
That's enough! Get out.

267
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,156
Yes, Ma'am.

268
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,767
That's Takako Uesugi.

269
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,234
She looks scary.

270
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,737
That picture!

271
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,071
I won't give up.

272
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,803
You have inherited the blood
of the Uesugi Family.

273
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,082
My son's blood.

274
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,684
Finally, I've found you, my granddaughter.

275
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:17,228
Kimiko is the granddaughter
of Takako Uesugi?!

276
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,494
Then, those guys must be...

277
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,303
Damn!

278
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,004
Hey, calm down.

279
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,741
Aren't you upset, brothers? A stupid guy
like that stole her from us.

280
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,243
Indeed.

281
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,202
The old lady suddenly told us that she
found the heir of the Uesugi Family.

282
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,179
From a different point of view,
it's pretty funny.

283
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:43,856
All the male relatives want to
marry her to take control of

284
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,189
the family's assets and are desperately
trying to get her.

285
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,464
I should have gone through
with my original plan.

286
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,591
What do you mean by that?

287
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,065
Everything would be better if she didn't exist.

288
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,076
Milk Soap

289
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,382
Your milk smell might spread to me!

290
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,274
No way...

291
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,118
Mature Woman Perfume
I guess I'm going to use this one.

292
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,430
It's so quiet!

293
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,295
Did it use to be like this?

294
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,238
Silly, he's no longer here.

295
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,712
Seasoning, seasoning...

296
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,016
This shelf is too high for me.

297
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,498
Here you go, little girl.

298
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,932
It's none of your business,
you stupid big tree.

299
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,301
What?

300
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,574
Oh, no, something's wrong with me.

301
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,943
What are you doing being
so noisy by yourself?

302
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,410
Nothing.

303
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,814
What are you making?!

304
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,116
Stew. Can't you tell?

305
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,277
But it's too much, isn't it?

306
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,854
I see! You made it for Mr. Saeba too.

307
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,951
He eats like a horse. I see, I see.
For Mr. Saeba.

308
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,496
I see.

309
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,932
No! I made it for tomorrow too.

310
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,867
We can't finish all that even in
two or three days.

311
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,604
The table is set for four.

312
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,973
You complained a lot, but I think
you liked living with Mr. Saeba.

313
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,679
Don't say such silly things. No one
could like that useless big tree.

314
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,549
I see. You've set aside your
little kid problem.

315
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,518
Now you can say something
like that? Well...

316
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,224
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

317
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,960
Oh, Mr. Saeba. I'm glad you're back!

318
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,096
Why did you come back?!

319
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,831
I haven't finished my work here.

320
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,820
What kind of work do you mean?

321
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:12,798
Well, for now, I have to finish the
stew that you made for me.

322
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,067
I didn't make it for you!

323
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,108
I made too much. If you want
to eat some, you may.

324
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,014
Idiot, why did he have to come back?

325
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,759
Idiot!

326
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,838
By the way, old man,

327
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,033
about what you're hiding...

328
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,247
I've finally started to understand what it is.

329
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,273
And also, I see why you need me.

330
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,522
If Kimiko is to inherit such large assets,

331
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:07,219
I know the men who've been following her
won't give her up so easily.

332
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:17,169
Guitar o kikase ta katta

I found out why men find Kimiko so
attractive and who her father is!

344
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,990
Really? Tell me!

345
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,992
Actually, her father is me!

346
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,361
Nonsense! You're being so silly saying that

347
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,396
and that's why Kimiko's missing now.

348
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,900
I'm sorry! Let me take you to the house
of the old woman of Uesugi.

349
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,902
Uesugi? You mean the Zaibatsu?

350
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,970
Is there any relationship to Kimiko?

351
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,305
City Hunter 2:

352
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,575
"Proposal From a Seventeen-Year-Old
Suspicious Date Panic (Part 2)"

353
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,042
If you miss it, I'm going to panic!

354
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,102
Please look forward to the next episode
