Here she comes!

18
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,556
Hey, hey, hey, wait! I said WAIT!

19
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,759
Hey, hey, would you like to have
some coffee with me?

20
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,709
If you don't want to have a cup
of coffee, how about...

21
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,336
Oh, your button.
If you don't want to have a cup
of coffee, how about...

22
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,744
Is it okay if I fix it without
taking your shirt off?

23
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,477
Oh, thank you very much.

24
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:35,780
What?

25
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,522
200 yen, please.

26
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,121
Oh, sure.

27
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,354
Thank you for your business.

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,531
Bye.

29
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,500
What a nice girl! See you.

30
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,698
Oh, wait a sec.

31
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:51,733
Yes?

32
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,163
Don't underestimate me!

33
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,872
Oh, I'm sorry.

34
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,451
I know how my face looks. I can't
believe you laughed at me.

35
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,248
Hey, baby!

36
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,057
Won't you have some coffee with me?

37
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,292
What the hell are you doing?

38
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,227
If you don't feel like a cup of coffee,
how about spaghetti with cod?

39
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:19,499
This guy is completely ignoring me.

40
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,659
Die!

41
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,378
Man, that looks painful.

42
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,142
Well, shall we forget about him and go?

43
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:42,182
Oh, your name is Shoko. I'm Ryo Saeba.
Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,523
We must be meeting like this because our
little fingers are connected by a red string.

45
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,495
What are you doing?

46
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,705
Don't worry, don't worry.

47
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,074
Well, why don't we go see a movie?

48
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,177
Before we do so, here!

49
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,053
Let's settle your bill. Three times on
my back, twice on my shoulder,

50
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,788
and you held my hand once a little while ago,

51
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,813
so the total is 2,650 yen. Right?

52
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,857
Well, you are too generous.

53
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,931
Shoko Takarada, nineteen years old.
She wakes up at 4 AM.

54
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,101
She delivers newspapers and
milk at the same time,

55
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,770
then she makes professional
wake-up calls.

56
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,343
She goes to college at 9 AM.

57
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,250
She answers roll call for students who
don't attend class, 150 yen each time.

58
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,385
Daisaku Gondawara?

59
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,287
Yes, Sir.

60
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:55,485
After school, she goes to the matches for
various athletic clubs for 3,000 yen per game.

61
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,331
In addition to all that, she works as
a model at the art school.

62
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,371
At night, she works at the noodle shop.

63
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,548
Now, as you saw, she is the target this time.

64
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,188
As you know, my Saotome Gumi has
improved its organization by picking up girls.

65
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,793
However, the quality of our members
is getting poorer and poorer.

66
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,100
They can't pick up any girls, and worse
than that, girls are laughing at them.

67
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,892
I am so sorry.

68
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,337
Now, I asked you to come here since
you are famous for picking up girls.

69
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,643
I'm getting older.

70
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:50,583
If one of you guys can get the girl,
I will make you my heir.

71
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,351
I see.

72
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,620
And I want that person to restore my family

73
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,256
by using the final technique
for picking up girls.

74
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,317
Shoko Takarada, she sure looks
like a nice babe.

75
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,698
She works so hard and she's so strong.

76
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,034
She seeks something valuable on
the road while she is walking,

77
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,730
and she never reports those valuable
things she picks up to the police.

78
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,406
If you manage to get a girl like this,

79
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,102
you could be called a real
professional womanizer.

80
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,572
I understand, Mr. Saotome.
You can feel at ease now.

81
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,516
I am Sabu the Womanizer.

82
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,518
The number of women I have slept with

83
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,112
is more than the number of sea shells
on the shores of the world.

84
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,418
What a beautiful way of describing
yourself, just like a poem. I like it.

85
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,594
I am not really interested in inheriting
a small family like this.

86
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,734
However, for the sake of my
honor as a womanizer,

87
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm gonna get her.

88
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,099
Lady Killer Tom, do you have
anything to say?

89
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,815
No.

90
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,586
Now, at sunrise tomorrow morning,
this game will start.

91
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,883
I hope you will all do your best.

92
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,966
Who is it?

93
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,729
Ryo Saeba.

94
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,372
What could you want so early
in the morning?

95
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,498
Let's go on a date.

96
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,615
Hey, why don't we go see a movie?

97
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,852
"Dangerous Love" which is very popular
now, or "Evening Calm"?

98
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,083
Oh, yes, "Love Story for You..."
That's it, isn't it?

99
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,124
It was so close.

100
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,000
Hi, Ms. Kaori, you're cute as usual!

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,058
Kaori?

102
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,704
Good! Special discount for you, 700 yen!

103
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,473
Good! You are a good man!

104
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,441
It's still expensive! 500 yen!

105
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,143
What? 500 yen?

106
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,703
Ryo?! What are you doing here?

107
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,715
Oh, Kaori, your voice sounds
cuter than usual!

108
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,116
I caught a cold!

109
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,651
650 yen!

110
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,886
Still too high.

111
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,285
Damn, how about 630 yen!

112
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,051
A little less, how about 550 yen?

113
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,326
That's not enough, pretty girl!

114
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,261
Pretty please!

115
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,259
Wow!

116
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,667
Wow! Super Special Discount! 550 yen!

117
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,736
Good! We did it!

118
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,703
Thank you.

119
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,804
Who is this girl?

120
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,938
I got you a 150 yen discount, so
you owe me 75 yen please.

121
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,714
I see. What a girl!

122
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,975
Thank you for your business!

123
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,290
Time to go to work now.

124
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,858
No way!

125
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,859
I have a good idea!

126
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,129
Hey, Mr. Saeba, if you have time, would you
like to help me with a side job?

127
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,831
I will, I will!

128
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,533
Good, fabulous!

129
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,634
See you, Kaori.

130
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,931
Oh, Ryo!

131
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:03,631
Well, I guess it's okay, she looks very
strong and Ryo can't do anything.

132
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,844
I'm going to go home and
recover from this cold.

133
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:12,375
Stone Broiled Sweet Potatoes!
So hot and so delicious!

134
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,355
Stone Broiled Sweet Potatoes!
So hot and so delicious!

135
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,524
Ms. Shoko, you have many jobs, don't you?
Stone Broiled Sweet Potatoes!
So hot and so delicious!

136
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,991
Ms. Shoko, you have many jobs, don't you?

137
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,886
Yes, I have more than this one.

138
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,562
What are you going to do with all
the money you're saving?

139
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,865
What am I going to do?

140
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,569
Money is the most important thing
in the world, isn't it?

141
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,504
That's why I'm saving. Understand?

142
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,995
No, it's not true. Money is not the only
thing you need in your life.

143
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:41,676
I have to get her to understand that.
It must be my mission!

144
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,306
What's wrong, Mr. Saeba?

145
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,620
Ms. Shoko, you are wrong.

146
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,955
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:53,449
There are a lot more important things
in the world than money.

148
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,094
What is more important than money?

149
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,127
What's more important is love.

150
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,132
Love?

151
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,095
That's right. All you need is love.

152
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:12,111
All I need is love! Yes, you are right.
All I need is love.

153
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,239
Mr. Saeba, I... I...

154
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,285
I was wrong.

155
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,486
Yes, well, don't worry, Shoko.
Everyone makes mistakes.

156
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,694
Mr. Saeba...

157
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,754
Well, come and I will hold you.

158
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,862
Mr. Saeba!

159
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,772
Yes, money is not the only thing
you need in your life.

160
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,206
Women should live for love.

161
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,905
Mr. Saeba, we can't live just with love.

162
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,814
All I need is money! Did you have
a nice dream, Mr. Saeba?

163
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,120
Charge for the dream of love, 3,000 yen.

164
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,994
What a strong woman.

165
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,964
Sweet Potato girl, hey, excuse me.

166
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:05,698
Yes!

167
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,567
Can you deliver sweet potatoes
here for 2,000 yen?

168
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,168
Sweet potato! Sweet potato! Sweet potato!

169
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,070
Sure, I will be right there.
Sweet potato! Sweet potato! Sweet potato!

170
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,171
Mr. Saeba, please!
Sweet potato! Sweet potato! Sweet potato!

171
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,365
Ah, sure.
Sweet potato! Sweet potato! Sweet potato!

172
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:21,109
Stone Broiled Sweet Potato!
Hot and delicious!

173
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,779
Stone broiled sweet potato!
Hot and delicious!

174
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,992
Stone broiled sweet potato!
Hot and delicious!

175
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,265
Stone broiled sweet potato!

176
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,762
Give me some.

177
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,505
Sure, 500 yen?

178
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,913
Thank you.

179
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,751
For you!

180
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,419
My power of love, the power to change
sweet potatoes into flowers!

181
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,456
My love, I devote myself to you!

182
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,091
Are you an idiot? Potatoes are
better than flowers.

183
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,824
Look at me. The flame of love,
burning in my heart!

184
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,241
Great!

185
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,674
Can you do it again?

186
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,639
Shut up! I hate kids.

187
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,671
Oh, no, don't be mean to them!

188
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,814
Only the worst kind of person
can be mean to kids!

189
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,212
Stuff happens. Now, this is super special.

190
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,152
Pigeons!


191
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,171
Well, ladies and gentlemen, the
super miracle performance.

192
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,230
Only 10 yen per person!

193
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,742
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you.

194
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,540
Hey, Shoko! Ms. Shoko!

195
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,580
I will be right there!

196
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,878
Excuse me, let me go through.

197
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:05,584
Hey, hey!

198
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,185
Oh, that's all?
Hey, hey!

199
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:06,852
Oh, that's all?

200
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,186
Hey, where are you going?

201
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,354
Hey, where are you going?
Ms. Shoko!

202
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,719
Bye!

203
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,725
I already paid! Hey!

204
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,022
Continue!

205
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:21,734
Damn! What do I care now?!
Here! How about this?!

206
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,698
He's finished, isn't he? Now it's my turn!

207
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,213
Finally, all the sweet potatoes are sold!

208
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,247
Thank you for your hard work.

209
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,578
It's cold!

210
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,617
Here's your cola.

211
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,386
Let's see, where did I put my change?

212
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,388
Don't worry. It's on me.

213
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,855
What? Are you serious?

214
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,693
Sure, I haven't paid for someone for...

215
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,688
Well, I don't remember how
many years it's been.

216
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,694
What a pleasure!

217
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,436
Delicious, isn't it?
Tastes good!

218
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,034
Mr. Saeba, you think I'm
unattractive, don't you?

219
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,376
Why do you think so? You're very cute.

220
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,279
It's been a very long time since a man
said something like that to me.

221
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:18,585
I used to believe that all I
needed was love, but...

222
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,866
I love you. Even if the Earth is torn apart,

223
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,664
or even if my life is taken away,
I will never ever let you go!

224
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,167
Well...

225
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,441
Sorry. Well, see you.

226
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,142
Hey, I love you, baby!

227
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,211
Masuo, Masuo!

228
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,217
No way!

229
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:53,314
He ran after the rich woman,
and he looked so happy.

230
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,521
Since then, I've decided that I will
never ever believe in love.

231
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,132
Fireworks in the town?

232
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,267
What the heck?

233
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,405
I love you?

234
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,494
What a showy appearance!

235
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,260
I think this is a good plan to make a
strong impression on a woman's heart.

236
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,828
Ms. Shoko, the fireworks you saw are
words from the bottom of my heart.

237
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,171
You know him?

238
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,263
No, I don't.

239
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,474
Here, this is my crystallized love for you.

240
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,743
Here, this is all yours.

241
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,540
Now, you are my lover, Ms. Shoko. Right?

242
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,319
Don't give me junk like this!

243
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,918
I really hate people who think that you can
do anything you want with money!

244
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,596
What are you talking about?
I know you want it.

245
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,223
Why don't you just accept it?

246
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,602
Even my mother has never hit me like that!

247
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,010
Remember this!

248
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,746
The consequences of making a rich man
like me mad are scary!

249
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,580
Momma!

250
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,343
Who the hell was he?

251
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,790
Finally, he's here.
Legendary Lady Killer, Tom.

252
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:41,232
People say that he doesn't need sweet
whispers or money to get a woman.

253
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,837
All he has to do is take off his sunglasses.

254
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,136
As soon as he does, a woman instantly
becomes his love slave.

255
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,301
Good evening, pretty girl.

256
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:54,947
Do you know him?

257
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:55,936
No, I don't.

258
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,730
You love me...

259
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,475
You love me...

260
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,604
You love me.

261
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,652
I...

262
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,331
I guess there is a story behind this,

263
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,767
but anyway, it's wrong to use
hypnotism to get a girl.

264
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,640
You weren't surprised at all
to see me shooting,

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,267
so you are not an ordinary person, are you?

266
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,570
I don't know.

267
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,310
You in the tank, stop immediately!
You in the tank, stop immediately!

268
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,313
What the hell?!

269
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,417
Stop! Cut it out!

270
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,326
The rich man is the strongest!

271
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,640
People have said my shooting is super
professional. You're gonna die.

272
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,940
Anytime.

273
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,916
Some people have big mouths, don't they?

274
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,685
What kind of a man is he?

275
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,559
I have no idea.

276
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,236
You're the one we saw a little while ago.

277
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:14,042
I'm gonna kill anybody who
hurts my pride. You, die!

278
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,956
What the hell is he thinking?

279
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,195
No, why do I have to suffer
through stuff like this?!

280
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,720
I have no idea at all.

281
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,164
The final stroke!

282
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,559
Final stroke?

283
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,371
Hey, hey, is he serious?

284
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:40,946
This is it!

285
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,413
Don't give up!

286
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,049
I will protect you!

287
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,347
I won't lose the game against
a money freak like him.

288
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,846
Mr. Saeba, but...

289
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,633
Both of you, die!

290
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,209
What? All three guys are disqualified.

291
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,644
It's over. It's the end.

292
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,656
How big!

293
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,097
Your back.

294
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,302
A man's back is for protecting
girls, you know.

295
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,645
I can't believe that the rich man lost.
The rich man lost?

296
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,726
No way, Ms. Kaori.

297
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,194
Please, a little more, 700 yen?

298
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,465
This fish costs 2,000 yen, you know?

299
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,932
Please!

300
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,065
Well, even so, it's still 1,700 yen per kilogram.

301
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,731
Even when she wears a dress,
she's still Kaori, so...

302
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,807
Shut up!

303
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,774
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,969
Mr. Saeba!

305
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,443
I've been looking for you.

306
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,150
You're Shoko!

307
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,880
You didn't tell me your address
or phone number.

308
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,055
Well, let's go out on a date today!

309
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,156
What's going on?

310
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:35,855
I decided that I'm going to dress up as much
I want to, because of the person I love.

311
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,665
And I'm also going to pay for everything
on our date today.

312
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,999
Really?

313
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,068
Yes, really!

314
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,870
Ryo!

315
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,038
This gentleman?

316
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,903
Yes, Sir. That's him.

317
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,436
It's a pleasure to meet you.

318
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,540
My name is Ikkan, the boss
of the Saotome Family.

319
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,618
I've heard about your technique of
picking up girls from one of my men.

320
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:04,180
Please, please agree to be my heir.

321
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,051
What are you talking about?

322
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,251
Please accept us, boss!

323
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,793
Boss?

324
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,693
I really must be going now!

325
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,437
Mr. Saeba!

326
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,705
Please, please wait!

327
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,138
Boss!

328
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:33,348
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

329
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,823

Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no

Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa

336
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,526
Don't you, don't you know

00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:20,899
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,

Hontou no dance, chance,
romance wa jibun shidai da ze

340
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,585
You got a job request again without
telling me, didn't you?

341
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,255
But Umibozu forced me to accept it.

342
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,591
Liar, it was to escort a blonde beauty so
you accepted it in secret, I'm sure.

343
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,895
But Kathleen does not seem like an ordinary
woman. She might be an assassin.

344
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:50,829
No way!

345
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,698
She might have been sent to kill Umibozu.

346
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,464
Oh, no! First of all, what's Umibozu's
relationship to Kathleen?
