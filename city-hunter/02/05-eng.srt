1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,958
A bodyguard for a mystery writer,
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

13
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,235
Your natural instincts?

14
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,670
A woman's intuition.

15
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,796
A woman's?

16
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,207
Having to work shut up in a
hotel room, that's too bad.

17
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,906
Being a bestselling writer isn't easy,
I tell you. Here it is, here it is.

18
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,871
What? It's open.

19
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,817
Hello!

20
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,217
My goodness, just look at that mess.

21
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,977
Keep it a little neater.

22
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,024
Blood!

23
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:05,991
What?!

24
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,790
It leads into that room.

25
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:23,298
A Mischievous Mokkori Detective?!
A Beautiful Writer's Mystery Game

26
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,606
Ryo, we have to notify the police.

27
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,706
The perpetrator may still be
lurking somewhere.

28
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,349
It's dangerous here! Wait out there!

29
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,355
Couldn't ask for a better client!

30
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,721
Oh, that's right. Oh, it's so sad!

31
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,062
Cause of death, a fatal knife wound
to the heart.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,499
I detect a slight reaction. Let's see...

33
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,465
Some very faint signs of life.

34
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,308
Just possibly, I can revive her
with artificial respiration.

35
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,213
In other words, mouth-to-mouth respiration!

36
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,193
How did you know?!

37
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,695
Telling the difference between
ink and blood is simple!

38
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,788
Forget that. Let's consummate
our love instead.

39
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,132
Liar

40
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,501
Liar
Pulling an underhanded trick!

41
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,126
Liar

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,677
Azusa...

43
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,013
Just what kind of man is he?!

44
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,617
Simply described,
the infamous Mokkori man.

45
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,314
Mok... He is completely insane.

46
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,690
That was a mistake back there.

47
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,557
That was like dangling a carrot
in front of a horse's nose.

48
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,420
It's typical of them, sending
me a guy like that.

49
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,664
There's something wrong with those
people at the publishers!

50
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,461
It would be much better to have no one at all.

51
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,035
Whispering like that isn't nice.

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,173
There should be no secrets
between us, my honey.

53
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,004
Ryo! Back off!

54
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,948
Where are you going?

55
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,049
Research.

56
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,284
For a story?

57
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,185
Right, this time I'm going to do a
hard-boiled detective story.

58
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,113
To do it, I need to learn a lot
about the underworld.

59
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,219
Kanto
Kimen
Gumi

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,991
Just a little higher. Okay!

61
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,142
If she were wearing a skirt, this
would be more enjoyable.

62
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,677
Did you say something?

63
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,575
No!

64
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,439
I'm in luck! No one's around. Okay...

65
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,448
Hey!

66
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,083
What the hell are you doing there?!
Tell me which gang you're from!

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,896
I'm Ryo from the Mokkori Gumi.

68
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,364
Son of a...

69
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:58,931
Hold!
Son of a...

70
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,829
Hold!

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,068
Don't be bothering those decent people.

72
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,330
Uh-oh...

73
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,176
Don't just stand there! Show our guests in!

74
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,973
Yes, Sir!

75
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,653
So many antiques.

76
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,016
Please, please, come in.

77
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,726
A yakuza these days just can't make the
grade if he can't even draw a picture.

78
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,230
A broad education counts for a lot in
helping us overcome our competition.

79
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,365
You're very good!

80
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,414
I see you've finally decided
to take my offer, Ryo?

81
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,483
My visit here today has nothing
to do with that.

82
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,476
Don't say such things.
Come join my organization!

83
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,990
I'll pay you this much in contract fees.

84
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,514
What are you whispering about?!

85
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:04,258
This young lady says she
wants to talk to you.

86
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,226
Are you a reporter or something?

87
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,701
I'm a novelist.

88
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:13,773
Good. Those lap dogs of the capitalists
loathe the very sight of

89
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,942
we common men of the working class.

90
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,043
I have two or three questions...

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,410
I have two or three questions...
Journalism, the servant of the elite
classes, takes every opportunity

92
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,682
Journalism, the servant of the elite
classes, takes every opportunity

93
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,449
to denounce the proletariat,
brandishing its mock humanism.

94
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,726
We completely reject the inequalities
of capitalistic society!

95
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,930
A good deed each day! A peaceful territory!
A happy society!

96
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,600
Equitable fees! A bountiful existence!

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,504
Come on, Ryo, I'll double it.
Won't you join up with us?

98
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,706
No! I can't stand yakuza!

99
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,470
You're so cruel, Ryo!

100
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,881
That's not what I wanted to learn about!

101
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,576
But yakuza nowadays...


102
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:03,656
I wanted to learn the real truth about things
like narcotics smuggling routes,

103
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,658
or how illicit gambling rings are operated!

104
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,890
I see. But he wouldn't tell you that stuff
if his life depended on it.

105
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,559
That's why I was trying to sneak in
so I could overhear something!

106
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,268
Scary!

107
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,065
We can't take our eyes off that one.

108
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,004
Today was a complete waste of time!
I get angry just thinking about it!

109
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,314
The publisher could have at least
sent me a better bodyguard!

110
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,475
A-ZU-SA!

111
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,195
No need to be so frightened like that.

112
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,364
How did you get in?
I'm certain the door was locked!

113
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,559
You're a novelist, why don't you guess?

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,267
Hey!

115
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,305
Hello, is Ryo bothering you?

116
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,796
I see. This is how you got in, right?

117
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,641
Ping-pong! Ping-pong!

118
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,413
What do you mean, "ping-pong?"

119
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,074
You sexual maniac!

120
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,346
What do you think you're doing?

121
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,314
You're both awake?

122
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,078
Who wouldn't wake up with all that racket?!

123
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,742
Staying up late isn't good for your beauty.

124
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,350
You can cool off out there!

125
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,025
Please forgive me!

126
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,699
Taxi!

127
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,504
Yotsuya Park Avenue!

128
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,805
Azusa!

129
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,239
Hurry!

130
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:00,806
Hurry!
Don't leave me behind.

131
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,832
Don't leave me behind.

132
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,040
If you promise not to get in
the way, you can come.

133
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,507
I give you my mokkori oath!

134
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,647
Wait! Wait! Wait!

135
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,125
I've been left behind.

136
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,032
Make sure you don't interfere, understand?

137
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,333
I got you.

138
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,928
He's one of the top two killers
in the underworld, see?

139
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,101
And what is he called?

140
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,174
It's better you don't ask.

141
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,143
Just hearing his name would make
you wet your pants. Oh, my!

142
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,588
A killer and an ice cream parlor?

143
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,522
Just like something out of a shojo manga.

144
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,025
At the risk of repeating myself,

145
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,425
make sure you don't say anything
like that when we go in!

146
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,059
The sign will be a red rose
pinned to his chest.

147
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,037
And the password is...

148
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,039
Password?!

149
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,040
There he is!
Password?!

150
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,267
There he is!

151
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,143
Him?!

152
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,110
Know him?

153
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,546
I didn't think so.

154
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,481
Where am I?

155
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,114
Who am I?

156
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,552
You're Mr. Umibozu, aren't you?!

157
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,640
Is there a particular reason you chose
this place for our rendezvous?

158
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,410
Of course, the more people around
the safer the place.

159
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,012
A pro all right!

160
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,448
Now what do you think? And you were
talking about shojo manga.

161
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,818
Speaking of a public place, you can't
beat sitting on Hachiko.

162
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,451
Oh, my! Are you catching a cold?

163
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,386
Just a touch of consumption.

164
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:06,991
My, a killer with a touch of consumption.
Oh, how romantic!



165
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,695
Maybe I have some of that too.

166
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,339
In your case, it comes from
unhealthy living habits.

167
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,668
Shock

168
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,609
Would two or three questions be okay?

169
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,738
If someone asks you to kill...

170
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,487
I mean, if the target specified
were an acquaintance,

171
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,123
for example, what would you do?

172
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,391
Well...

173
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,188
You just don't accept the contract.

174
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,127
It's just like he said. You decline
the job from the start.

175
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,500
A personal question, but do you
have a girlfriend?

176
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,172
Girl...

177
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,208
What a silly question.

178
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,812
One look at that face, and even a
female gorilla in a zoo would run.

179
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,143
Mr. Saeba!

180
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,883
Yes, yes, have you heard of this
man of phenomenal skill

181
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,078
in the underworld called City Hunter?

182
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,527
I've heard the name, but his skill
is far inferior to mine.

183
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,793
Being well-known doesn't necessarily
equate with prowess.

184
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,864
Anyway, he's not as good as they say.

185
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,128
If a showdown with him came to pass,
what would you do?

186
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,907
I'm sure I'd win,

187
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,443
but it's better not to mix it up
with other professionals.

188
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,877
But what if it were unavoidable?

189
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,708
Then, we'd tango.

190
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,812
Fine with me! Let's do it!

191
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,052
I told you to be quiet!

192
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,584
I don't care, I don't care.

193
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,590
Thank you so much for your time today.

194
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,125
Man of the Shadows
It's your book.

195
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,370
Could you autograph it?

196
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,663
Oh, you surprised me.

197
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,945
Mr. Saeba!

198
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,850
Getting all embarrassed over an autograph.

199
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,545
I couldn't stand to watch it.

200
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,047
It's better than plastering your face to
a window for everyone to see.

201
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,692
How far are you going to follow us?

202
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,455
A-zu-sa!

203
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:29,167
The worse the man is, the more
gentlemanly the face he presents.

204
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,913
Check under the surface and he's doing
evil to his heart's content.

205
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,815
And outwardly he always appears
to be engaged in honest work.

206
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,082
But what kind of work to make it?

207
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,662
I wonder what she's mumbling
to herself about?

208
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,664
Guarding her well?

209
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,632
Of course! It's my job.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,502
Is this your job too?

211
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,339
That's strange. What's a brassiere
doing in my pocket?

212
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,934
Kaori, it appears this room
is wrapped in mystery.

213
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,047
What are you doing, Kaori?!
How can I guard her like this?!

214
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,514
Guard her and be quiet!

215
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,084
Something in which you can
hide narcotics or the like.

216
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,080
Something a customs officer wouldn't
pay much attention to.

217
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,790
Something that would pass a
cursory examination.

218
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,283
That's it!

219
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,365
Art objects! And not some fancy
paintings or sculptures,

220
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,767
but 19th century furniture or silver
candlesticks or something.

221
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,234
Right! Antiques!

222
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,832
Wait!

223
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,245
I'm certain there's a curio shop around here.


224
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,716
Here it is.

225
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,551
That reminds me, they had a lot of
antiques at the Kimen Gumi.

226
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,663
Is there anyone here?

227
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,064
I guess not.

228
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,035
Manager's office

229
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,176
What a room!

230
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,701
Good taste considering the illicit things
going on behind the scenes.

231
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,484
Will he come alone, do you think?

232
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,180
He knows the difference between
business and pleasure.

233
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,641
Kobo Daishi's writing brush.

234
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,811
An excellent idea for a fake,
if I do say so myself.

235
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,247
You use that to lure the Kimen Gumi
boss out and kill him,

236
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,715
and the Kimen Gumi turf is yours.

237
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,925
Hello, Kimen Gumi?

238
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:00,492
Right.

239
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,129
Owner of the antique shop speaking.
I wonder if your boss is in?

240
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,698
Please wait.

241
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,735
Sir, we have Kobo Daishi's brush here.

242
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,437
Really?! I can't believe it!

243
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,506
Tonight at ten o' clock, at that
warehouse on Harumi Wharf.

244
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,064
We're agreed on the price?

245
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,910
I don't intend to haggle.

246
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,400
I'll be waiting, then.

247
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,448
Shall we celebrate?

248
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,343
Make me a martini.

249
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,642
Who are you?!

250
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,125
Stay back!

251
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,558
Not the vase!

252
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,934
Let me down! Let me down!

253
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,373
Please! I'll do whatever you say!

254
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,578
Calm down!

255
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,245
Umibozu! You came to save me, didn't you?

256
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,520
Anyway, I want no part of it.

257
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,658
How can you say that?!
You call yourself my bodyguard,

258
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,717
but you haven't done anything
at all bodyguard-like!

259
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,498
Why just now, what would I have done
if Umibozu hadn't shown up?!

260
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,161
You put yourself in danger by taking off
on your own like that!

261
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,773
That's how I am, I'm sorry.

262
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:24,174
But this time I'm asking you,
so can't you help me?

263
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,280
You don't owe that yakuza boss anything,
just forget about him!

264
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,415
I'll go.

265
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,283
If you come, Umibozu, it'd be such
a big help. Thank you!

266
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,054
Then I'm coming too!

267
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,284
Well, I thought you weren't coming.

268
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,586
Umibozu, won't you come up to
the lounge for some tea?

269
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,464
You too, Kaori.

270
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,260
Okay.

271
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,193
Fine! I'm the one who gets left out.

272
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,704
Please do something, Kaori.

273
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,505
Don't go depending on others!

274
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,052
They're here.

275
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,862
Azusa!

276
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,967
Did you bring the money?

277
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,434
And the item?

278
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,136
Right here.

279
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,985
Now!

280
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,426
You set me up!

281
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,656
It's your fault for being too trusting!

282
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,228
What the...

283
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,691
What happened?!
Someone, turn on the lights!

284
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,101
Don't move! I'm not letting you get
away with your dirty trick!

285
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,033
And I owe the boss there a good turn.

286
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,033
That's Ryo's voice.

287
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,913
Who are you?!

288
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,682
I am...

289
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,774
Umibozu!

290
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,951
That lousy...

291
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,349
No one who interferes with me gets
any mercy. Get him, men!

292
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,718
Where'd they go?!

293
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,073
What the...

294
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,877
What's happening?! Men! Answer me!

295
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,812
You're the only one left.

296
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,779
What?!

297
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,386
What's so funny?

298
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,220
You think I'd come with so few men
to an important deal?

299
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,157
What?

300
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,367
You want to have a party?

301
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:07,235
You might as well make jokes while you can.
Hand over that gun now.

302
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,743
Where'd the other one go?

303
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,146
He's a good one for running away.

304
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,943
Are you so sure about that?!

305
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,219
Ryo!

306
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,119
Saeba!

307
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,177
Damn!

308
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,089
Hold it right there!

309
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:24,885
Azusa!

310
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,991
Don't move!

311
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,526
Help!

312
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,651
That dirty bastard!

313
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,697
Run!

314
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,602
If you fire now, the gun will blow up.

315
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,637
If you can even pull the trigger, that is.

316
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,765
Men! What are you waiting for?!
Kill them all, right now!

317
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,408
Don't move! You move and your boss dies!

318
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:52,248
Go ahead and shoot!
But you'll be Swiss cheese!

319
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,623
Maybe you're right. But before that happens,

320
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,217
want to bet I get one shot at you?

321
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,323
But the big guy here is my shield.

322
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,629
Want to try it?
My Colt Python, .357 magnum...

323
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,432
It has the power to put a bullet
right through the big guy.

324
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,479
Are you insane?!

325
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,003
Make your choice!

326
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,174
Drop your weapons now!

327
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,386
Ryo, would you really have fired?!

328
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,127
Good question. What would you
have done in my place?

329
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,130
I wouldn't have given it a second thought.

330
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,096
Real men, the male mystique personified.

331
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,482
Dandy Mystery
All Men Are Wolves

332
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,916
Dandy Mystery
All Men Are Wolves
Azusa's latest novel is very interesting!


333
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,621
A tale of men.

334
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,112
In my next life, I'm going to be
reborn as a man!

335
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:10,024
Still, the hero somehow reminds me
of a certain someone.

336
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,799
You don't think? No...

337
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:32,714
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

338
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,189
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

339
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,920
You skip dinner and eat diet food

340
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,059
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

341
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,471
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

342
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,804
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

343
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:02,908
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

344
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:11,987
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

345
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,892
Don't you, don't you know

346
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:20,265
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

347
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:28,104
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

348
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:34,004
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

349
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,912
So, now you've gone and picked up
the daughter of a genius painter?!

350
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,256
It's a job to model and to be a bodyguard.

351
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,884
Saying that while drinking your
