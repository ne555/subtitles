The blonde beauty Kathleen is trying to
kill Umibozu to avenge her father.

13
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,336
Did Mr. Umibozu really kill her father?

14
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,372
No way! The truth is, Kathleen's
father was killed by

15
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,076
the boss of the organization that Umibozu
smashed. His name is Dandy Jack.

16
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,878
That means, the person who
raised Kathleen is the one

17
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,379
who really killed her father, doesn't it?

18
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:58,112
Umibozu snuck out of the house to kill
Dandy Jack, even though he was badly hurt.

19
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,451
Hey, Umibozu, what do you think you
can do with injuries like that?

00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,006
What the hell? What's going on?


23
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,751
Who are you, standing there?

24
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,953
Long time no see.

25
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,289
Umibozu?!

26
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,756
Where is Dandy Jack?

27
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,155
Dandy Jack? I don't know.

28
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,891
This is the only place around here he
can get guns or a rocket launcher!

29
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,261
I don't know what you are talking about.
Go home and don't come back.

30
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,274
You have pretty good taste.

31
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:05,778
Of course. Many precious stones are set in
it and it costs more than 3,000,000 yen.

32
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,977
What the hell are you doing?!

33
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,423
This statue is also good.

34
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,519
Stop, Umibozu!

35
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
This one is also great!

36
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,563
Wait a second, I understand!

37
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:26,236
This is it. This is the address of the
rental house that I showed him.

38
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,940
If he is not there, I have no idea where he is.

39
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,112
Sorry to disturb you.

40
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,570
Hey, it's incredibly expensive! Hey!

41
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,602
Yes, it's me. You? What do you want?

42
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,367
Hey, just like you said, Umibozu came here.

43
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,837
I acted like I didn't know anything,
and he started breaking things.

44
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,673
How you gonna pay me back
for this damage?

45
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,878
You should be happy that you're not dead.

46
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,118
Falcon, you're acting exactly as I planned.


47
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,416
This time, I will finish you,
along with Kathleen.

48
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,104
Great!

49
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,237
For me, Falcon is just like
a part of that target.

50
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,979
I will prove it to you.

51
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,342
You have lived like that for
eight years, haven't you?

52
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,979
After revenge, what will be left for you?

53
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:33,522
I don't need anything left.
All I want is to kill Falcon.

54
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,033
You're forgetting the most important thing.
The reason you're here right now

55
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,066
is because Umibozu risked his
body and protected you!

56
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,811
So what? What's your point?
I have nothing to do with it.

57
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:51,409
You said he is a coward who shot your
father in the back, didn't you?

58
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,719
Then, why did a man like that protect you?

59
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,258
He's a liar. He wanted to show you
how cool he is, I guess.

60
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,398
No matter what he does at this point,

61
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,026
the fact that he killed my father
cannot be changed!

62
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,173
Hey, Ryo, can we do anything for her?

63
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,103
At the moment, it will be useless
no matter what we say to her.

64
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,075
But while we are here, Umibozu
might be killed by Dandy Jack.

65
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,119
I don't think so.

66
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,916
Umibozu is just like a wounded animal now.

67
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:35,723
There's one person who'd be able to
kill him, but it's not Dandy Jack.

68
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,891
Do you mean you, Ryo?

69
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:46,567
No, the only person who can kill
Umibozu now is Kathleen.

70
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,736
That girl?

71
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:23,109
Mr. Saeba, sorry about the incident last
night. If I had known you were there,

72
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,441
I wouldn't have fired a rocket.

73
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,310
I know you didn't come here to
give me excuses like that.

74
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,786
Exactly, no wasting time. I came
here to get my partner back.

75
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,583
Your partner, no way! You shot a rocket
into a place where Kathleen was.

76
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,488
If you were a real partner, you wouldn't
have been able to do that!

77
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,927
Really, young lady? Falcon is
our common enemy.

78
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,603
In order to kill Falcon, Kathleen would
be happy to sacrifice herself.

79
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,940
Right, Kathleen?

80
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,481
Sure.

81
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,211
Ryo wouldn't do things like that!
I know he wouldn't!

82
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,553
It's a waste of our time to debate
with you. Well, Kathleen, let's go.

83
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,861
Wait!

84
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,868
Would you please accept my appreciation
for taking care of Kathleen?

85
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,563
Well, so long.

86
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,105
Wait!

87
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,641
Ryo, do something, please!

88
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,717
I don't have any right to stop her.

89
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,184
Ryo!

90
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,261
She's gone. We couldn't do anything for her.

91
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,857
Give it to me, Kaori!

92
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,488
Ryo, it was...

93
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:21,394
A bomb, hidden in the flowers.
Dandy Jack is that kind of man.

94
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,520
Let's go.

95
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,156
Wait, wait for me, Ryo!

96
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,189
Ryo!

97
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,539
Hey, Jack, I might have died
from that rocket.

98
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:47,353
I guess, but you are alive and will be
able to fight against Falcon.

99
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,981
You should thank your late father in Heaven.

100
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,061
You use this next time.

101
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:59,760
You'll be able to shoot Falcon
right in the heart using it.

102
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:06,063
It will probably be your last chance.
Prepare for it. You got it?

103
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,346
Ryo, what are you going to do now?

104
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,493
Nothing will be over until we correct
Kathleen's misunderstanding.

105
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,296
It might be a little rough, but
there's no other way.

106
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,230
What do you mean?

107
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,432
Make the three of them meet at once.

108
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,559
After that, we bet everything on Kathleen.

109
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,000
Bet on her?

110
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,491
Looks like he didn't set anything
outside of the house.

111
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,780
Kathleen! Why is she here?

112
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,018
Come out, Falcon. I know
you're somewhere close.

113
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,629
Come out. Why don't you
fight against Kathleen?

114
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,792
Or can you only shoot people
in the back, coward?!

115
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,963
You sound tough, Dandy Jack.

116
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:05,251
After eight years, Falcon, I have been
looking forward to seeing you.

117
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,962
You disappeared from the
picture at that time.

118
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,523
Now, you show your dirty face, but this
time, you're hiding behind a woman.

119
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,570
Don't misunderstand me.
I am Kathleen's guardian.


120
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,301
I'm here as a witness of Kathleen
avenging her father.

121
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:27,913
Kathleen, it's okay with me if you want
to kill me to avenge your father.

122
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,973
However, before you do so, please
let me finish my own business.

123
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,020
You look ugly, Falcon.  What are you going to do in your final moments?

124
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,787
I'm gonna kick you into Hell, Dandy Jack!

125
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,856
Kathleen, what are you doing?

126
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,798
The man in front of you is the
one who killed your father.

127
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,299
Shoot, shoot him now!

128
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,136
Heywood was a brave man.

129
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,469
I am still proud to have been his partner.

130
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:49,195
What are you doing, Kathleen?!
This is the last chance, don't miss it!

131
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,662
Kill Falcon!

132
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,354
That's it, Dandy Jack!

133
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,687
Wait! Can you kill me?
Think about it very carefully!

134
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,097
If you have anything to say, say it
to Heywood in the next world.

135
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,272
I'm sorry, Falcon, but I can't watch
Jack die without doing anything.

136
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,944
Oh, Kathleen, good job! Yes, indeed.
I am your adopted father.

137
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,389
Now, do it. Avenge your father, for eight
years you have been waiting for this.

138
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,016
Shoot! Shoot now!

139
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,564
Ryo, how long are you going to
let them go like that?

140
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,733
If we don't do something now,
Umibozu will be shot.

141
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,224
Wait. The only thing we can do is wait!

142
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:07,840
What's wrong, Kathleen? You don't need
to hesitate to kill a coward like him.

143
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,105
Do it! Pull the trigger, and you'll be
free from eight years of suffering.

144
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,248
You forgot an important thing.

145
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,708
The reason you're here now is because
Umibozu risked his life to save you.

146
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,620
Watch out!

147
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,227
What is a partner?!

148
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,889
If you were a real partner, you
wouldn't have been able to do it!

149
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,198
What are you doing, Kathleen?!

150
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,691
Now, it's the time to avenge your father.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot him now!

151
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:44,335
No! I don't understand! What is the
truth, Jack? Now, I am confused!

152
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,841
Damn! What the hell are you
saying at a time like this?!

153
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,948
Give it to me! You idiot!

154
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,587
Kathleen!

155
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,383
Don't move!

156
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,833
Rescue her! She'll fall soon
if we leave her like that!

157
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,401
So what?

158
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,231
What?!

159
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,340
I've spent eight years making this woman
into a professional killer.

160
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,676
However, as you can see, she's useless.
If I kill you, she's just trash.

161
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,382
You bastard! You raised her
until now, just for that?

162
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,685
Exactly.

163
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,187
You destroyed my organization

164
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,956
and my grudge over that can't be
cleared just by killing you.

165
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:35,393
So I decided to raise Kathleen as a
hitman and use her to kill you.

166
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,327
Kathleen did a good job.

167
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,832
Without knowing that the person who
killed her father was really me.

168
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:49,608
How is that? How did you feel about
being targeted for revenge

169
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,304
by the daughter of a man who
used to be your partner?

170
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,509
This is extreme revenge, isn't it?

171
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,516
Oh, no, no way.

172
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,050
You son of a bitch!

173
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,630
What a nice compliment for me!
Go to Hell and meet Heywood there.

174
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,929
I will send Kathleen shortly after you.

175
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,211
Who the hell?

176
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,571
Umibozu, hurry up and rescue Kathleen!

177
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,816
Ryo, don't let Dandy Jack go!

178
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:36,716
Sure!

179
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,064
Umibozu!

180
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:50,468
Stop, Falcon! I tried to kill you.
Let me go or you'll fall too.

181
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,204
No way, I'll rescue you for Heywood!

182
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,032
Falcon...

183
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,379
Kathleen!

184
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,025
Kathleen, cut it out.

185
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,825
I was your adopted father for eight years.

186
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,995
Wait! Don't shoot me, please wait!

187
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:13,648
It's okay now. Heywood wouldn't want
you to do any more than this.

188
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,578
Falcon...

189
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,626
It was so intense at one point, but
I guess she understands now.

190
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,061
Die, Falcon!

191
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,736
Son of a bitch!

192
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,165
It's all over now.

193
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,690
Umibozu couldn't protect your
father eight years ago.

194
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:36,664
That's why he didn't explain when you
told him that he was your target.

195
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,663
For him, your father was the
first and the last partner.

196
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,348
Falcon!

197
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,614
Falcon, I... I...

198
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,654
It's okay. Don't say anything.

199
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,850
Falcon!

200
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,722
Good, all misunderstandings
have been corrected.

201
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,172
Tokyo International Airport

202
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,211
Falcon?!

203
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,257
What are you going to do now?

204
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,588
I'll gain my eight years back
as an ordinary girl.

205
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,660
I'm sure that Papa would be
happy if I do so.

206
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,396
Good smile. Finally, you're back to
the girl I knew eight years ago.

207
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,744
The first and the last partner.

208
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,914
Hey, Ryo, we're like that, aren't we?

209
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,983
What are you talking about?

210
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,052
I just said!

211
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,019
What?

212
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:32,882
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

213
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,356
Marude juni dake kisou Faye Dunaway

214
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,087
Yuushoku mo tabezu ni, diet food

215
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:48,225
Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

216
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,637
Kimi wa kangeki mo sezu morau dake de

217
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,970
Mansion no temae de, say goodbye

218
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:03,075
Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no
otoko to iu mono o

219
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:12,154
Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa
sou wa inai hazu sa

220
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,059
Don't you, don't you know

221
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:20,432
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

222
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:28,271
Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,
ju-yon-kai mo shogezu ni

223
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:34,170
Hontou no dance, chance,
romance wa jibun shidai da ze

224
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,554
Finally, you're screwed Ryo! I can't
believe that you kidnapped a woman!

225
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,257
It was my pay for having solved a
hijacking case for Saeko.

226
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,792
Saeko is mad!

227
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,695
Lisa wants to be a traditional Japanese
woman, so I am coaching her.

228
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,898
She is the daughter of a foreign minister
of an overseas country.

229
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,633
Mokkori has nothing to do with it.

230
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,803
Yes, it does. What will we do if this
causes a diplomatic incident?

231
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,004
City Hunter 2:

232
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,073
"The Applicant Wants to Be a Traditional
Japanese Woman?! Mokkori can Overcome
National Boundaries (Part 1)"

233
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,631
If you don't watch it, you'll be embarrassed.

234
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,677
Please look forward to the next episode
