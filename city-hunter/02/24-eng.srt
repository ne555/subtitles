Shirozaru, Aozaru, Akazaru, good job!

13
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,082
Yes, Ma'am.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,634
I, Kaede of Han'nya, of the 13th
generation after Hanzo Hattori,

15
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,159
will finish you, Ryo Saeba!

16
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,432
Damn it!

17
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,344
Take this!

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,920
The Final Weapon, Sexy Sigh

00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,505
What's this crowd doing here?

20
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,144
A notice board?

21
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,240
XYZ?!

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,053
I would like to challenge you to a duel.

23
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,580
Today, at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon,
come to Shakujii Field.



24
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:17,394
If you don't show up, you'll be revealed
throughout Japan as a coward.

25
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:22,635
13th generation after Hanzo Hattori,
Iga Ninja School, Kaede of Han'nya.

26
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,170
What the hell is this?!

27
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,330
This is a letter of challenge!

28
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,734
Ryo! Is Ryo there?

29
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,706
Big news!


30
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,175
Ryo!

31
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,315
What? A letter of challenge?!

32
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,617
Yes, 3 PM at Shakujii Field.

33
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,084
It's a serious duel!

34
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,020
Three? Oh, no!

35
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,821
What's the matter?

36
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,948
I have a date at three.

37
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,260
Kaori, I'll leave this matter to you.

38
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,732
I don't care what happens, you idiot!

39
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,349
I wonder if Saeba is coming or not?

40
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,383
He will.

41
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,613
I'm sure he has his pride,
being a professional.

42
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,156
When he appears in front of me, he'll die,

43
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,148
and then I'll become one of the top
members of the underworld!

44
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,787
We'll see, Saeba!

45
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,668
See you.

46
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,671
Are you leaving already?

47
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,504
Yes, I have something to take care of. Bye.

48
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,945
Well, the day's not over yet.

49
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,412
Let's go!

50
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,117
Hey, girl, why don't you have some tea
with me?

51
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:44,684
No!

52
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,948
I'm Ryo. Let's go out on a date.

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,655
Let's have some sweets together!

54
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,989
How about we have some brandy
together in the morning?

55
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,759
Just tea? How about a movie?

56
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,826
Hi, sweetie.

57
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,661
What do you want?!

58
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,457
Oh, no!

59
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,703
Ms. Kaede, two hours have passed
since the appointed time.

60
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,580
Just like Musashi killed Kojiro,

61
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,384
Saeba is attempting to make us irritated,
so don't get impatient!

62
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,646
Yes, Ma'am.

63
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,119
You can't get me, Saeba!

64
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,833
Miss?

65
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,927
How about going out with me for some tea?

66
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,731
Oh, I've been looking forward to seeing you!

67
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,276
Really?

68
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,210
You're so late!

69
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,579
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

70
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,644
No, don't worry.

71
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,957
Damn, I've had bad luck all day.

72
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,515
I guess I'm going home now.

73
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,963
Oh, a beautiful flower in the rain.
Mokkori butt!

74
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,523
Hey, sweetie!

75
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,864
Kaori?!

76
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,597
What's wrong with you, you jerk?

77
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,137
This has been the worst day of my life.

78
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,217
Ms. Kaede, it's been about six hours
since the appointed time.

79
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,491
Ms. Kaede?

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,400
Oh, no, this is his way of attacking
someone when they fall asleep!

81
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:49,675
Ms. Kaede, I wonder if he ignored us?

82
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,473
No way! He should have his
pride as a professional!

83
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,683
Well, he might not.

84
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,109
Hey, Ryo, do you think it's okay to
ignore the letter about that duel?

85
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,383
What? Duel?

86
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,484
What are you talking about?

87
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,917
Damn, this is just like him.

88
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,754
Hey, another one please.

89
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,880
Yes, Sir. Thanks for your business.

90
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,862
What a strange fish cake slice in my noodles.

91
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,675
What is this? This is a throwing star!


92
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,438
Ryo Saeba, come out!

93
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,538
What do you want? I'm eating my noodles!

94
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,211
I've finally found you.

95
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,018
You tried to avoid my challenge,
but it won't work with me.

96
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,758
Wow, look at her, Kaori. She's a ninja.

97
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,953
She might be the one who sent us the letter!

98
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,861
Here we go, Saeba!

99
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,626
Help me! She's trying to kill me!

100
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,838
Indeed, you are Saeba.

101
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,306
You escaped from my attack.

102
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,542
Excuse me, but I didn't do anything.

103
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,612
Wait a minute. Why are you targeting him?

104
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,846
It should be obvious.

105
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,407
If I kill Ryo Saeba, my name and my team
will become world famous.

106
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,356
Oh, finally! Ms. Kaede's final weapon!

107
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,790
Eat this! The power of
Windmill Throwing Stars!

108
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,363
It sure has incredible destructive power.

109
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,528
Play time's over.

110
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,770
Now, ninja magic, Leaves of Fire!

111
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,482
There's no wind, but the trees are moving.

112
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,416
I will do anything for Ms. Kaede.

113
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,250
Ryo!

114
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,228
Did you see it and learn to
fear Iga ninja magic?

115
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,960
Oh, no! The wind is moving against me!

116
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,136
It burns! It burns!

117
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,233
You jerk!

118
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,307
How cute your mokkori butt is!

119
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,209
What the hell?! Go away!

120
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,078
Wow, your boobs are bigger than I expected!


121
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,957
You're my type!

122
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,791
Damn it! He gets like this every time
he sees a woman!

123
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,500
The final duel will be at noon tomorrow!

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,991
I will be waiting for you at Shakujii Field!

125
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,607
No way, I can't wait until tomorrow!

126
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,371
I have nothing to do tonight, so why
don't you go out with me?!

127
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,945
Let me go! You jerk!

128
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,970
Kaede!

129
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,050
Ms. Kaede!

130
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,517
Later!

131
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:25,150
Kaede, see you at Shakujii Field tomorrow!

132
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,901
Watch me very carefully.

133
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,204
Do this and do this way and...

134
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,605
Then this way.

135
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,207
Oh, good job!

136
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,732
Who taught you this, Akazaru?

137
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,712
Kurozaru, who quit being a ninja.

138
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:51,183
After all, he's now a salary man
at Sun Sun Pharmaceuticals.

139
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,052
A salary man?

140
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,952
That sounds so cool!

141
00:10:55,755 --> 00:11:01,894
Not only that, but also Momozaru
became a contract worker.

142
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,429
A contract worker?

143
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,896
What the hell is that?

144
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,628
Well, I don't know the details.

145
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,633
Anyway, it sounds so cool!

146
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,674
Yeah, I wish I could be a salary man.

147
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,576
Every morning, putting a tie on,
bringing a lunch box...

148
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,480
And I've also heard that they can get
a bonasu several times per year.



149
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,482
Bonasu? What the hell is that?

150
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,785
It ends in "nasu", so it must be
something to eat.

151
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,878
You're talking about a bonus.

152
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,524
I don't like having to use a
western-style bathtub like this.

153
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,033
I wonder if you are thinking about
betraying me? Are you?

154
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,100
No!

155
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,535
No, there's no way, Ma'am.
No!

156
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:42,967
No, there's no way, Ma'am.

157
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,107
I understand it's very difficult for a
ninja to live in this present time.

158
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,105
However, don't forget that our blood contains
the nobility of the Iga Ninja School family.

159
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,520
One more time, just once, we shall
establish the time of the ninja,

160
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,385
and repay our ancestors.

161
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,749
Yes, indeed, Ma'am.

162
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,860
In order to do so, we have to kill him.

163
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,828
No matter what, we have to kill Ryo Saeba.

164
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,604
Welcome, Ryo Saeba.

165
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,508
You should know that today is
the last day of your life.

166
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,654
Do you really want to challenge
me to a duel?

167
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,557
Absolutely!

168
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,220
I will kill you, and the Iga Ninja School family
will become the rulers of the underworld.

169
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,352
The rest of you, stay back.

170
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,461
Here we go!

171
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,247
Mokkori butt, one point!

172
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,176
Wait!

173
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,183
Don't drop your guard!

174
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,229
Mokkori boobs!

175
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,097
Understand? It's ninja transformation magic!

176
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,296
Ready?

177
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,734
Mokkori thigh!

178
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,744
Skinny back!

179
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,979
You jerk!

180
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,866
You look very tired, so why
don't you give up?

181
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,163
Not yet!

182
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,943
With you in that condition,
I guess the duel is over.

183
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,110
Shut up! Shut up!

184
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,645
There's a long way to go
before we're finished!

185
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,447
Ms. Kaede...

186
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,176
How admirable she is!

187
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,487
Shirozaru, Aozaru, are you ready?

188
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,222
Sure!

189
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,519
Of course!

190
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,252
Say goodbye to our dream
to become salary men!

191
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,427
What are you doing to me?!

192
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,835
Oh, man, you still don't understand?

193
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,770
You're not the type of person to be a ninja.

194
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,205
What?

195
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,475
You're a woman who should be
loved by a man.

196
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,409
Ridiculous! Let me go!

197
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,752
I won't forgive you if you humiliate
Ms. Kaede any more.

198
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,221
We, the three monkeys of the Iga family,

199
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,882
will take care of you on behalf of Ms. Kaede!

200
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,147
Now, let's fight, Saeba!


201
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,322
You guys!

202
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,642
What incredible power!

203
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,042
This is for real, Ryo!

204
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,778
Now, you can't use your firearm, can you?

205
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,521
Take this!

206
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,484
The Iga family's famous chain reaping
hook, the Yamato no Orochi!

207
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,890
What?

208
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,228
No way!

209
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,172
Secret sword technique,
Descending Dragon!

210
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,703
Ryo!

211
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,309
What is this?!

212
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,407
What?

213
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,479
The Way of Saeba, the magic
of transformation.

214
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,790
Even Shirozaru lost!

215
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,655
A dream! This has got to be a nightmare!

216
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,894
It's Akazaru's turn now!

217
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,158
Oh, man, do you really want to continue?

218
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,698
No questions accepted.

219
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,531
Final weapon, Iron Hook! Take this!

220
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,233
He has such a showy thing.

221
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,938
Wait!

222
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,911
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

223
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,673
It's cowardly to run away!

224
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,770
There's no way to escape now, Saeba.

225
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,072
This place will be your grave.


226
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,372
Now, ninja magic, Dividing Bodies!
Here we go!

227
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,816
What?

228
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,525
How about this, Saeba?

229
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,517
Can you tell where I really am?

230
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,967
You fool!

231
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,834
You chose death by your
own will, didn't you?

232
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:56,000
Then die!

233
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,475
Idiot! Where are you shooting?!

234
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,406
I'm sorry, but I guess you're
not lucky enough.

235
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,703
Akazaru!

236
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,372
Akazaru!

237
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,342
Ms. Kaede, I'm so sorry.

238
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,113
Akazaru, you were the best in
the Iga family, but...

239
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,044
He's strong. Too strong!

240
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,923
I guess this game is over now,

241
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,689
or are you going to continue
to take care of me, Kaede?

242
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,929
Ms. Kaede has nothing to do
with this whole thing.

243
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,897
If you want to kill her, kill me instead!

244
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,935
Well, I've heard that ninja are very persistent,

245
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,630
so I guess I had better finish you.

246
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,697
Stop!

247
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,375
Please stop, Saeba.

248
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,715
Ms. Kaede!

249
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,411
It's okay. We lost.

250
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,779
I didn't know that the underground
world could be so tough.

251
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,859
We are too immature.

252
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,930
I will give up on getting your life.

253
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,262
Ms. Kaede! Ms. Kaede!

254
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,929
Ms. Kaede...

255
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,265
You did a good job.

256
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,341
Thank you so much.

257
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,451
Goodbye, Saeba.

258
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,759
Can I ask you one question at least?

259
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,060
Am I really an attractive woman?

260
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,138
Yes, of course. Mokkori guaranteed.

261
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,909
I see...

262
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,713
Is it okay?

263
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,115
You might not be able to see her again.

264
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,185
Well, I'm in the possession of somebody

265
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,222
a lot stronger than those three monkeys.

266
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,089
Hey, what do you mean, "in the
possession of somebody?!"

267
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,315
The train left us behind again.

268
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,486
I don't understand how people
can get in there.

269
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:06,562
Salary men may have to train
themselves more than ninja do.

270
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,968
Damn, we'll be late!

271
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,703
We have no choice. Shall we go?

272
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,499
Sure!

273
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,612
By the way, I wonder how
Ms. Kaede is doing?

274
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,848
Yes, I hope that she'll be successful.

275
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,816
I hope so too.

276
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,622
Yes?

277
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,522
Saeba, I've come here to be your bride.

278
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,892
I've changed my strategy.

279
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,805
I'll marry you and have several children.



280
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,206
Then, I will raise them to become
professional ninja!

281
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,411
Wait a second!

282
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,242
I can't marry you all of a sudden!

283
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,915
I've already decided!

284
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,177
I won't let you go until death do us part.

285
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,422
You told me that I'm a woman that should
be loved by a man, didn't you?

286
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,190
I guess I did.

287
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,988
The baby will be a boy, right, Saeba?

288
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,656
This is ninja magic called the Sexy Sigh.

289
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:21,035
I wonder if I should learn ninja magic?

290
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:32,606
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

291
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:37,089
Marude juni dake kisou Faye Dunaway

292
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,820
Yuushoku mo tabezu ni, diet food

293
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,959
Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

294
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,371
Kimi wa kangeki mo sezu morau dake de

295
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,704
Mansion no temae de, say goodbye

296
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:02,808
Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no
otoko to iu mono o

297
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:11,887
Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa
sou wa inai hazu sa

298
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,792
Don't you, don't you know

299
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:20,165
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

300
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:28,004
Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,
ju-yon-kai mo shogezu ni

301
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:33,903
Hontou no dance, chance,
romance wa jibun shidai da ze

302
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,385
Mr. Keiichi is gorgeous, isn't he?

303
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,988
Really? He's skinny and looks like
a woman, doesn't he?

304
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,356
Do you know that he looks good when
he dresses up like a woman?

305
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,758
Oh, I'm going to see a mirage.

306
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,692
I told you so.

307
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,096
But as a man, he has to protect himself.

308
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,230
I will teach him.

309
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,398
While making him dress up like a woman?

310
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,467
I can concentrate to teach him
when he's dressed so.

311
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,234
Excuse me.

312
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,402
City Hunter 2:

313
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,670
"Targeted Witness!

314
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,772
A Dangerous Beauty Dressed Up
Like a Man (Part 1)"

315
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,899
If you miss it, I'm going to make you
dress-up like a woman.

316
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,667
Please look forward to the next episode
