1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,701
Hey, Ryo, how long are you going to sleep!?

14
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,169
Hurry and wake up. We need to
distribute these flyers!

15
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,272
Oh, he's not here.

16
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,670
He escaped again.

17
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,048
That's why we don't have any work!

18
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,572
I'm giving up now!

19
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,486
I can't believe her.

20
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,512
Does she really think that we'll get clients
by distributing stupid flyers?

21
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,626
I think finding love partners for
the happy springtime

22
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,762
is more important than doing work like that.

23
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,432
Pretty strong personality, but I'll pass!

24
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,526
Both of these two are good, but not my type.

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,664
Oh, she's good! I'll take her!

26
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,212
Hey, who's that man in the red shirt,
who's mumbling something over there?

27
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,510
Geek! The worst kind.

28
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,986
Pass on these also.

29
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,318
I can't believe they can't
understand my looks.

30
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,218
Wow, mokkoshi, good one.

31
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,726
Long time no see, Mr. Saeba.

32
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,070
I've been wanting to see you.

33
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,538
I couldn't forget about you.

34
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,742
What?

35
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,972
Excuse me, but who are you?

36
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:03,471
Ryo is the Love Thief!
Hidden Love Affair Behind the Magic Mirror
(Part 1)

37
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,382
You still can't figure it out?

38
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,261
I usually don't forget a
beautiful girl like you.

39
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,559
Then, look at this.

40
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,331
Leotard?

41
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,464
Leotard...

42
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,872
Wait a second...

43
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,874
No way!

44
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,676
You must be...

45
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,649
I remember!

46
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,895
You're the Flying Tush!

47
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,694
I thought you would say that.

48
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,005
Phantom 305, Kasumi,

49
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,909
back then, you were so cute, but now,
you've matured and look good!

50
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,813
What a coincidence, that we
ran into each other.

51
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,839
Now, why don't we find a nice place
where we can be alone.

52
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,291
My family is gone and nobody is here.

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,455
You understand what I mean, don't you?

54
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,127
Sure, of course I do.

55
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,898
Listen, my room is straight down the hallway.

56
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,272
Please wait five minutes, then come.

57
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,740
Why?

58
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,039
Don't ask. Women have to get ready
for something like this.

59
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,511
See you in a little while.

60
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,446
What a cute tush!

61
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,942
She'll be mine soon.

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,983
I hope you'll do well, Mr. Saeba.

63
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,279
It's really too long.

64
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,975
I can't believe that five minutes is this long!

65
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,152
Now...

66
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,784
Kasumi!


67
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,089
Five minutes are past!

68
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,800
Ippatsu!

69
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,517
Kasumi!

70
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,576
Ippatsu!

71
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,600
I kissed a strange old woman!

72
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,039
Kasumi!

73
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,666
How was he, Grandma?

74
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,910
Grandma?

75
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,036
Yours?

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,473
I don't remember anyone who was able to
reach this place in such a short time.

77
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,821
On top of that, he triggered all the traps,
but he escaped from all of them.

78
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,789
He's incredibly flexible.

79
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,223
Traps?

80
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,117
Oh, that's why my jacket is like this.

81
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,864
Therefore, he passed this test.

82
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,059
Wow, he did it!

83
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,435
You did it, Mr. Saeba! We've got
approval to get married!

84
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,272
Get married?

85
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,603
What's going on?

86
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:57,150
I had a strange test, was lured by a one-time
mokkori, kissed an old woman,

87
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,718
and now you're talking about getting married.

88
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,913
You have to explain what all this is about.

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,324
Still too optimistic.

90
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,556
The family rule?

91
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,902
My family have all been thieves
for generations.

92
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,167
In order to continue the family business,
there are some strict rules.

93
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,372
For example, women have to quit
being a thief and get married.

94
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,614
And the husband needs to have
the best thievery skills

95
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,345
as selected by the Asou Family.

96
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,849
Anyway, I don't have the freedom
to choose my own husband.

97
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,752
That's ridiculous.

98
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,029
This rule has been around for a long time

99
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,998
in order to ensure our descendants
will be good thieves.

100
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,436
After they turn twenty years old,

101
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,894
the lives of our women are dedicated
to raising perfect children.

102
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,766
The man who will be my husband

103
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,680
has already been chosen by the family,

104
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,240
by Grandma, the head of our family.

105
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,418
I can't stand a rule like that.

106
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,914
I'm a woman and I have a dream of
falling in love and getting married.

107
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,723
But there is only one way to cancel
the marriage with the fianc

108
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:25,004
That's if the person I actually want to
marry has superior thieving skills

109
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,438
and is able to have superior descendants

110
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,272
even though that person is not
a member of the family.

111
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,146
I see, then you remembered
working with me.

112
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,613
Yeah, I guess.

113
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,985
Saeba is so gorgeous that I can
dedicate myself to him

114
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,987
and I want to marry him,

115
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,121
that's why.

116
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,588
No, that's not it.

117
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:50,219
I want you to act as my lover for now in order
to cancel my engagement with my fianc

118
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,532
Just as I thought.

119
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,867
Please, I want to escape from this old rule,

120
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,665
as well as from this family which is
tied up with the rules.

121
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,672
It's impossible to do this by myself,

122
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,970
but if you help me, I'll be able to do this.

123
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,436
Well, I understand how you feel,
but I'm losing interest.

124
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,651
And also, that old woman, she's not easy.

125
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,642
She said I passed this test,

126
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,011
but she never said that I can be your fianc

127
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,085
Takashi!

128
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,326
I guess you're able to think a little bit.

129
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,126
I see, you're the fianc

130
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:34,597
You must be the funny guy who wants
to steal the thief's Fianc

131
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,510
What are you doing here all of a sudden?

132
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,779
What a nice greeting, Kasumi.

133
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,077
My great aunt invited me.

134
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,783
What?

135
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,284
He's right.

136
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,786
I invited him to come here.

137
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,622
Saeba is just a candidate to be
your fianc

138
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,792
until he shows us the skills which will
convince all family members

139
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,259
to agree to accept him.

140
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,797
How do you do, Great Aunt?
I'm glad you look fine.

141
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,333
Grandma, he said you invited him.
What's going on?

142
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,602
We'll have both of them take another test,

143
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,339
and decide which is best suited
to be your fianc

144
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,705
Well, today is just for greetings. Come in.

145
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,777
It's too obvious.

146
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,577
I don't think that stupid obstacle race is a
valid reason to cancel my engagement.

147
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,085
Oh, no.

148
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,420
Anyway, she said to come in so let's go.

149
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,688
Mr. Saeba?

150
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,125
It would irritate me if you got
married to that snob.

151
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,922
So, leave the matter to me.

152
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,570
Grandma, even without another test,

153
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,940
it's been already proven that
I have more flexibility

154
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,238
and better thieving skills.

155
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,277
So what?

156
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:49,081
The point is to see which one is better
to have more children,

157
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,851
and to have better descendants, isn't it?

158
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,519
Which means?

159
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,789
It means that I, the one who people
call Mokkori Ryo-chan,

160
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,316
won't lose in that area against
that snobbish guy.

161
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,292
Good, now, come with me for a little while.

162
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,729
Great Aunt, I need to use the next room.

163
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,739
Well, I don't have any interest in men.

164
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,401
Stop being a pervert like that
and just come. Now!

165
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,137
Damn, I guess I'm going.

166
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,514
Mr. Saeba...

167
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,954
I wonder what is going on in there?
It's too quiet.

168
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,871
Takashi, what did you do to Mr. Saeba?!

169
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,205
Nothing really, we had a serious talk,
man to man.

170
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,917
Great Aunt, I guess he agreed to
have another test somehow.

171
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,719
I see.

172
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,086
Well, the test will focus on thieving
skills as we planned.

173
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,925
The time will be three days
from now in the evening.

174
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,260
I will tell you the details at that time.

175
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,727
Understood?

176
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,690
After all, he's an amateur thief.

177
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,229
The result will be obvious and I can
already see it, Kasumi.

178
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,903
See you later.

179
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:26,841
Mr. Saeba!

180
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,386
Mr. Saeba!

181
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,491
What's the matter, Mr. Saeba?

182
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,789
What did he do to you?
Pull yourself together! Hey!

183
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,106
Mr. Saeba?

184
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,608
Oh, no.

185
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,077
His was 5cm longer.

186
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,412
No way, I...

187
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,109
I lost against him over the
size of my mokkori.

188
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,484
Anyway...

189
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,927
I wonder if he'll be able to improve his skill
as a thief in just two or three days?

190
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,104
Don't be depressed like that.

191
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,839
In this situation, I'll help you.

192
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,898
I can't accept that rule either.

193
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,808
Kaori!

194
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,880
What are those barbells?

195
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,184
These? To prepare for the battle.
I'm going to start special training.

196
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,718
Special training now?

197
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,016
Good! My opinion of you is improving, Ryo.

198
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,023
Wait and see.

199
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,982
I will be able to pick up all of these
barbells with just my mokkori.

200
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,227
Ms. Kasumi, now I really accept your favor.

201
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,399
I will compete against him.

202
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,893
I'll banish my anger against him in three days
through a mokkori battle.

203
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,540
Jerk!

204
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,302
Heaven's
Punishment

205
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,844
What didn't you understand?!

206
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,445
The test is about thieving skills.

207
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,845
Oh, is that so?

208
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,258
Well, what kind of special training
are we going to do now?

209
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,725
Catch-can.

210
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,528
Hey, hey!

211
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,796
It's easy, isn't it?

212
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,831
I will run away from you all over town,

213
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,958
and you chase me and catch me.

214
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:32,426
But you have to follow exactly
the same route that I use.

215
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,877
Catch-can is pretty hard. I would
like to have a handicap.

216
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:42,781
No, you only have two days to get your
physical ability up to my level.

217
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,147
Don't worry. I know you can do it, Mr. Saeba.

218
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,647
Okay, okay. Well, shall we start?

219
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,353
What's the matter? Aren't you
going to start running?

220
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,463
There's definitely something wrong
with you today, Mr. Saeba.

221
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,930
You're not like yourself.

222
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,698
Because if you were, you would be...

223
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,037
No, I don't want to train hard
like that, Kasumi.

224
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,666
Put on your leotard so I can
see your flying tush.

225
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,140
He was shocked by the incident
yesterday, I guess.

226
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,013
Okay...

227
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:18,211
Mr. Saeba, if you catch me,
I will let you touch my tush.

228
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,355
It might not be working. Was that too weak?

229
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,921
Kasumi!

230
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,656
I'll get your tush!

231
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,070
What power!

232
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,698
That's the real you, Mr. Saeba! Let's go!

233
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,309
I won't let you go!

234
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,421
Damn!

235
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,152
Mr. Saeba!

236
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,250
I'm here! This way!

237
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,190
You!

238
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,530
I got you!

239
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,659
Old man, this way, come this way.

240
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,235
Damn!

241
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,102
What was that?

242
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,486
What kind of guy is he?

243
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,011
He's already at Kasumi's level.

244
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,784
I have to do something about it now.

245
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,832
Damn, I lost her.

246
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,993
I wish she had more consideration for me.

247
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,967
Well, anyway, I'm a little bit worn out.

248
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,268
Oh, I'm in front of Miki's coffee shop.

249
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,970
It won't hurt if I rest there.

250
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,176
Welcome!

251
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,816
What? What's the matter? Do you have
some funny story or something?

252
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,789
No, nothing.

253
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,125
I'm so sorry.

254
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,434
Don't show up all of a sudden like that.

255
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,698
Even if I know you, your face is scary.

256
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,540
Anyway, what's with your outfit?

257
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,508
Are you still the master of this shop?

258
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,045
I told you that you shouldn't do that.

259
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,036
Your sales are going to drop.

260
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,255
What?

261
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,956
Why are you quiet?

262
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,924
You're no fun at all!

263
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,675
No, Falcon, it's rude to laugh at him.

264
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,108
Same to you!

265
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,875
Ryo, you...

266
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,073
You lost the mokkori size comparison,
didn't you?!

267
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,995
How do you know that?! No!

268
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,860
How do you know about that?!

269
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,634
Everybody knows. It's all over town!

270
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,400
Testimony 1: Ms. Akemi of Club R

271
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,476
It's true. That person, Takashi, his
mokkori is bigger than Ryo's!

272
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,841
I was surprised!

273
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,377
Testimony 2: Girls from Cabaret Neko Manma

274
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,150
Yes, he came here too.

275
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,880
We all were surprised. I couldn't believe
that he won against Ryo!

276
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,313
Testimony 3: Master of Bar EXTRA

277
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,459
Oh, that man?

278
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,860
He's very handsome, so Mokkori Ryo is over.

279
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,332
Well, that's what's going on.

280
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,935
I heard there was a snobbish guy who
mentioned it everywhere last night.

281
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,304
The rumor is all over town now.

282
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,033
Bastard!

283
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,239
He got me.

284
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,511
Found you! What are you doing wasting time
in a place like this?!

285
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,110
Please be serious about this training.

286
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:14,776
Mr. Saeba?!

287
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,528
Don't look at me like that. I'll be fine.

288
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,122
I will win the game and get even with him.

289
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,434
Also, men shouldn't be judged by their size.

290
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,527
I don't care about the rumor.

291
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,501
What kind of laugh was that?

292
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,934
He's got more heart than I expected.

293
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,681
Oh, no, he's lost his will completely.

294
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,809
Ryo is useless when he doesn't
have any mokkori power.

295
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,150
I see, I'm sure that Takashi
must have known that.

296
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,892
His way of stealing something is not
the proper method like ours.

297
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,860
He usually cheats.

298
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,896
Cheats?

299
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,659
He uses very strong hypnotism.

300
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,433
Hypnotism?!

301
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,769
Yes, he puts a person into a
hypnotic state, for example,

302
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,371
and gets the code of the safe from him,
then steals the valuables.

303
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,134
It's not a proper way to be a thief.

304
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,314
Hyp...

305
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,281
...notism?!

306
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,282
He might have used...

307
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,518
Yes, that's right. He put Mr. Saeba
into a hypnotic state, and...

308
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,043
He made you think that his
was bigger than yours.

309
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,257
We must be right. There is no bigger
mokkori than yours!

310
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,725
No one has a bigger one. I would know
better than anyone else.

311
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,696
Oh, no, how vulgar I was.

312
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,630
I emphasized it without realizing
what I was saying.

313
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,968
Now I understand.

314
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,636
That impostor jerk!

315
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,070
I'm still the King of Mokkori!

316
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,600
I guess you found out.

317
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,410
Takashi!

318
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,878
He's the snob I've been hearing
about, isn't he?

319
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,811
You used a dirty trick, didn't you?

320
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,916
I don't know why you came here, but
anyway, it's a good opportunity.

321
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,156
I don't want to touch your face,

322
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:02,160
but this time, I'm pretty mad and I have
to give you one in the face!

323
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,627
Eat this!

324
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,730
No! Don't look at his eyes!

325
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,285
Now you won't be able to win against me.

326
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,378
What did you do, jerk?!

327
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,093
What is it?

328
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,117
What? A letter or something?
What is it?

329
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,499
Come on! You don't have time
to look at mokkori stuff!

330
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,671
What?

331
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,964
Mr. Saeba?

332
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,603
I can't mokkori anymore.

333
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,646
You're right.

334
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,582
Thanks to my hypnotism, your
mokkori is useless now.

335
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:01,119
If you win the game against me
without your mokkori power,

336
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,950
I'll release you from the hypnotic state.

337
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,381
Oh, no!

338
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,464
My mokkori has been kidnapped!

339
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,401
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

340
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:20,098
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

341
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:26,000
But I couldn't do so

342
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:36,511
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

343
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:42,916
You don't know the reason I'm here

344
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:57,843
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

345
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,210
I wouldn't have let you go

346
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:09,485
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

347
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:15,726
Everyday life is starting

348
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:26,003
In my mind, time has stopped

349
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:32,343
And a double-decker bus is passing

350
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,920

Hey, cheer up!

351
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,122
I'm fine. I'll complete the job I took.

352
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,091
Oh, no, you don't have any power any more.

353
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,493
Just steal the mirror from the house.
It's easy!

354
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,096
It's too easy. I wonder if Grandma
is planning something?

355
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,831
Fear is often greater than danger.

356
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,533
The game has already started.

357
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,768
First of all, start moving! Hurry up and go!

358
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,836
City Hunter 2:

359
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:01,006
"Ryo is the Love Thief! Hidden Love Affair
Behind the Magic Mirror (Part 2)"

360
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,906
If you miss it, your power won't come back!

361
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,901
Please look forward to the next episode
