1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,400
How funny!

14
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,435
You look very good for a master.

15
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,673
Speechless!

16
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,342
Miki!

17
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,643
Yes!

18
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,179
Only today.

19
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,281
I'll never do this again!

20
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,772
Yes, Sir! I know that.

21
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,249
Well, it's very kind of you.

22
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,590
Miki's been dreaming of owning
a coffee shop with you

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,990
and you've made it come true.

24
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,592
Well, one day is good.

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,200
The customers who were here were all
chased away when they saw your face.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,101
Now it's afternoon, and look around.

27
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,039
If you continue to do this, this shop
will go out of business.

28
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,738
You, jerk! What a big mouth!

29
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,214
You said what you wanted to say!

30
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,217
It's okay, Falcon. I don't care if
there are no customers.

31
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:34,812
Just you and I being together
makes me so happy.

32
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,827
Actually, you took the best for yourself.

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,362
In the Story of Genji,

34
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,193
the main character, Hikaru Genji,
did the same thing.

35
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,466
When you saw her when she was little,

36
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,331
I'm sure you thought she would
become a beautiful woman.

37
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,502
What do you mean?

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,276
You planned it and raised her
since she was a little child,

39
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,546
and made her fall in love
with you, didn't you?

40
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,347
You were inspired by Hikaru Genji

41
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,907
and your plan is Umibozu's
Shining-Head Genji Plan.

42
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,885
How about that?

43
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,488
You jerk!

44
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,623
Mokkori jerk!

45
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,792
I was just kidding! Idiot, stop it!

46
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,384
Shut up! You die!

47
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,996
You're the one who's going to die!

48
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,999
Oh! You broke stuff in the shop!

49
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,864
There they go again.

50
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,429
I wonder whether they're good
friends or enemies?

51
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,439
I give up.

52
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:32,867
Mokkori Everywhere!
Ryo's Mind and an Esper Girl
(Part 1)

53
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,482
Here we are.

54
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,052
This place is a coffee shop, isn't it?

55
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,044
I'm sure Ryo is in here all day doing nothing.

56
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,285
Welcome!


57
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,459
Monster!

58
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,298
Umibozu...

59
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,300
What is it, Kaori?

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,836
What do you mean by that?
What's going on here?

61
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,304
Well, not a big deal, I guess.

62
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:05,236
Oh, boy. Our clients are going to get
so scared that they'll run away.

63
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,044
Time to work, Ryo.

64
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,159
Here I go!

65
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,128
What a mokkori cutie!

66
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,206
What kind of place is this?

67
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,808
There's no sweeper, just a pervert like that.

68
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,266
No, that pervert is the sweeper.

69
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,315
What kind of client is she?

70
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,748
But she is cute.

71
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,511
I'm sorry to tell you, but she
is not exactly the client.

72
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,479
Look at her very carefully.

73
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,152
Oh, mokkori bust!

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,296
Look lower.

75
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,730
Lower? What do you mean?

76
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,425
A kid?!

77
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,706
I'm Akiko Asagami.

78
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,231
This girl's, Ms. Sara's, nanny.

79
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,674
Nanny? Babysitter?

80
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,948
I've never heard of a nanny who
is young and also strong.

81
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,907
Ms. Akiko studied at a nanny
school in England.

82
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,523
That school trains special nannies
who work only for noble families.

83
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,482
She has both academic and physical
skills, and she is the best.

84
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:33,632
Ms. Sara will be the eighteenth head
of the Nishikujo family.

85
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,269
Nishikujo?

86
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,938
The ones who used to be nobility?
Owners of the Nishikujo Concern?

87
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,739
Yes!

88
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,138
I don't like it.

89
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,676
Ryo!

90
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,946
Speaking of the Nishikujo family, the
seventeenth head of the family,

91
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,506
Shigenobu Nishikujo, died
due to an illness recently.

92
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,180
This is about the family's property, isn't it?


93
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,354
Yes...

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,118
I don't like it. I don't want to get involved.

95
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,028
Ryo, you say that because you don't
want to guard a child, right?

96
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,663
Why don't you agree, Ryo?

97
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,996
It's a good chance for you to initiate
the Hikaru Genji plan.

98
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,802
You'll be kind to the child, won't you?

99
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,573
She's rich, and she'll grow up
to be a beautiful woman.

100
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,709
I guarantee it. Oh, what a lucky guy!

101
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,371
You silly octopus. Stop talking nonsense.

102
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,445
What is it? Hey?

103
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,197
What is she doing?

104
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,563
Her eyes, I feel that she can read my mind.

105
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,401
Ms. Sara!

106
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,010
Hey, Ryo, what did you do to her?
You made her cry!

107
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,034
Wait!

108
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,281
A lonely person,

109
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,683
in a lonely world, just like being
covered with ice.

110
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,652
Being alone and fighting by yourself
in a world like that.

111
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,282
But the heart is very, very warm.

112
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,659
Ms. Sara...

113
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,892
This girl...

114
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,098
Ms. Sara has a very mysterious power.

115
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,573
Intuition or something like that.

116
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,598
She can touch other people's minds.

117
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,045
Ms. Sara has been under the
envious eyes of her relatives,

118
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,537
who want to get the property,
since she was a little baby.

119
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,120
Ms. Sara was raised in an atmosphere
like that, and she became sensitive,

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,884
able to feel the ugly minds
behind their smiles.

121
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,726
Up until now, she has only opened up
her mind to her late father and me.

122
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,525
So I was surprised to see her talking to you.

123
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,067
You're the first person she's spoken to
since Mr. Shigenobu,

124
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,558
her father, passed away.

125
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,174
Hey, Umibozu.

126
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,710
Was that true, what you told me?

127
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,143
What are you talking about?

128
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,615
You told me that she'll become
a beautiful woman.

129
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,083
Was that true? Answer me!

130
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,152
Yes, yes, she will. I'm positive!

131
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,555
Good! I can't lose with Umibozu.

132
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,058
Hikaru Genji Plan, now in action!

133
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,892
I accept this client!

134
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,662
Oh, my goodness! What a mess!

135
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,728
This place is too filthy for
Ms. Sara to live in.

136
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,973
It usually looks a little bit better than this.

137
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,441
Excuse me, Ms. Akiko.

138
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,176
Are you sure you want to make
this place your hideout?

139
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,512
Yes, the mansion is too dangerous.

140
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,882
I don't know about that. I think this
place is more dangerous.

141
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,550
What?

142
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,954
No, the location of this building makes
a sniper's job difficult.

143
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:46,186
Even if he's known for his lewdness,
this really is a sweeper's hideout.

144
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,227
There's a big difference between
here and the mansion

145
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,695
where anyone can pick you
off from anywhere.

146
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,932
No, what I wanted to tell you was...

147
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,867
The only problem is the filthiness
of this room.

148
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,682
Oh, what a good job!

149
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,951
Indeed, you are the nanny for a noble family.

150
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,986
Big difference from someone I know.

151
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,453
I'm so sorry.

152
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,025
By the way, I heard you saying
something strange,

153
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,085
like accepting the clients for the
Hikaru Genji Plan or something.

154
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:29,168
Are you intending to educate Sara now to
become your target ten years from now?

155
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,570
You're silly.

156
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,605
Do you think I am patient enough
to do something like that?

157
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,664
It's a joke, just a joke.

158
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,177
Well, no matter how it turns out,
ten years is ten years.

159
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,805
For now, I guess I better take
the current mokkori.

160
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,953
No, no! Don't try to read my mind now.

161
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,623
Currently, in my mind, I am thinking
about the adult world.

162
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,292
A kid like you shouldn't see
things like that. Right?

163
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,987
Oh, I'm an airplane now!

164
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,029
Idiot.

165
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,575
She doesn't know I'm here. I'm going
to have mokkori secretly.

166
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,207
Thanks for the snack!

167
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,288
Oh, Mr. Saeba, I didn't know you were here.

168
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,019
Yes, I'm here. Please hurry up
and turn the switch off.

169
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,995
What are you doing, Ryo?

170
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,734
Nothing, I think various things love me.

171
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,929
What shall I do?

172
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,249
Incredible! Shining!

173
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,351
Looks like a different house.

174
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:56,022
And the food! Indeed, she is the best nanny!

175
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,592
You are the best woman among
women, the best!

176
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,027
Oh, thanks.

177
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,063
I'm going to fire Kaori, so would you
please work for me here?

178
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,328
What the hell are you talking about?!

179
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,733
Wow! I've never eaten this much
in my entire life!

180
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,700
Well, are you trying to say
my cooking isn't good?

181
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,344
Kaori?

182
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,811
You're fired.

183
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,514
You jerk!

184
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,082
Ms. Sara Nishikujo has been kidnapped.
You jerk!

185
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:23,707
Ms. Sara Nishikujo has been kidnapped.

186
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,085
The Nishikujo family reported
this incident to the police.

187
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,086
News
Ms. Sara's nanny, Akiko Asagami
is the suspect.

188
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,554
Ms. Sara's nanny, Akiko Asagami
is the suspect.

189
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,388
Ms. Sara's nanny, Akiko Asagami
is the suspect.
Akiko Asagami (22 years old)

190
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,322
The kidnapped child is Sara Nishikujo,
an eleven-year-old girl.
Akiko Asagami (22 years old)

191
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,517
The kidnapped child is Sara Nishikujo,
an eleven-year-old girl.
Ms. Sara Nishikujo (11 years old)

192
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,594
The police department is investigating
as best as they can.

193
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,357
Next, the weather forecast.

194
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,099
Ms. Akiko, can you explain the
kidnapping on the news?

195
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,134
No way, you took her without
telling anybody?

196
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,736
Of course.

197
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,873
Right now, we don't know which relative
is trying to kill Ms. Sara.

198
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,502
Therefore, if Ms. Sara is hiding somewhere,
I'm sure the person will start taking action.

199
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,437
Of course, I know this is dangerous.

200
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,074
That's why I came to you, Mr. Saeba.

201
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,313
I'm impressed. You really are the best nanny.

202
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,492
But...

203
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,093
Kaori!

204
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:07,993
What?

205
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,255
You're fired.

206
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,823
Excuse me, Akiko, but would you
please be my partner?

207
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,834
I'm sorry, but I'm just a nanny.

208
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,872
Just a nanny, I see.

209
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,742
But I feel more than that when
I see you serving Sara.

210
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,184
There is no one apart from me to whom
Ms. Sara can open her mind.

211
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,244
I thought I was the only one
who could save Ms. Sara.

212
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,036
The time has come.

213
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,239
No matter what a super nanny she is,

214
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,207
I know she's sleeping deeply
at this time of the night.

215
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,542
It's 2:00 AM. Now, time to
sneak into her room!

216
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,384
Ms. Sara, you scared me.

217
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,058
Damn...

218
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,127
I wonder if this girl is reading
my mind and finding out

219
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,061
that I'm going to sneak into Akiko's room?

220
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,395
What's the matter?

221
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,803
I feel lonely.

222
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,395
I want to be with you, please.

223
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,609
I'm in trouble.

224
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,072
I'm busy tonight.

225
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,119
Traces of her tears.

226
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,455
Her father died recently. I can understand.

227
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,825
I guess I have no choice.

228
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,396
I'm going to cancel the plan for
tonight, just for tonight.

229
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:07,046
Ms. Akiko told me that Ms. Sara
disappeared from her bed.

230
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,081
I can't believe this!

231
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,744
Your Hikaru Genji Plan has become
a Lolita complex, hasn't it?!

232
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:19,091
I'm really disappointed in you!
Die, you pervert!

233
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,524
It's a big misunderstanding!

234
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,967
I'm so sorry.

235
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,265
I heard the true story from Ms. Sara.

236
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,471
I knew something was wrong at the time.

237
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,107
I know you don't have a Lolita complex.

238
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,310
You're so welcome. I slept like a baby

239
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,802
after I was tied up, rolled up in a
mattress and left on the roof.

240
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,750
I guess it will take a while for his
mood to be back to normal.

241
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,878
Well, I thought I'd go shopping
with him, but I guess not.

242
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,217
Okay, I'll go with you.

243
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,993
Ryo will take care of Sara while we're gone.

244
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:54,789
No, you can't.

245
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,963
If it's outside, Kaori, you won't be
able to guard her.

246
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,331
I'll go. Okay?

247
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,600
Yes, I understand.


248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,161
Chance, it's a chance. Just Akiko
and me, the two of us.

249
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,814
Are you sure it will be all right to go
shopping, just you and him?

250
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,684
I'll disguise myself so they
won't recognize me.

251
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,252
Also, Mr. Saeba will be with me.

252
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,955
That's the reason I'm worried.

253
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,024
Are you ready? Let's go.

254
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,926
Sure! Well, Ms. Kaori, please
take care of Ms. Sara.

255
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,332
Who are you?

256
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,061
Where did you come from?

257
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,735
What's the matter, Ryo?

258
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,465
This boy came from somewhere inside.

259
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,941
Ms. Sara!

260
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,806
It's my overalls!

261
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,312
Oh, my!

262
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,847
What's the matter with you putting on
an outfit like that?

263
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,747
I'm going with you.

264
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,753
Oh, no, no, burdensome, no.
It's dangerous. Right?

265
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm in disguise.

266
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,923
Damn it!

267
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,555
See you later. Be careful!

268
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,331
Well, now, Ryo can't do
anything to Ms. Akiko.

269
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,404
Hey, but they look like a good family.

270
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,777
Family, husband and wife, a kid.

271
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,837
I don't know why, but I'm getting mad.

272
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:26,474
Famous Sake Trial
Exciting Bazaar

273
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,812
This is good. Do you like this?

274
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,248
Daily necessities, how about those?

275
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,752
Toothbrush, cups, slippers,
and here, for Ms. Sara.

276
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,763
Here, a bra!

277
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,232
It was very difficult to find this small size.

278
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,065
You don't need to look for this at all.

279
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,362
Well, she doesn't need these yet.

280
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,777
88cm, C cup.

281
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,512
This design is pretty good.

282
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,946
This one would probably look good on Akiko.

283
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,720
Well, take those off.

284
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,312
I'm going to put these on for you.

285
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,553
Oh, I'm so happy.

286
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,694
What is it Ms. Sara?

287
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,218
Your face turned red.

288
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,430
Furniture

289
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,835
Excuse me, Akiko, but our bed is
too narrow so shall we buy this?

290
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,303
This is very soft.

291
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,364
No thank you. I like a narrow bed better than
a wide one, so the one I'm using now is fine.

292
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,176
Is that so?

293
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,441
That one is too narrow for us
to sleep together.

294
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,152
Akiko, I'll sneak into your room to see you.

295
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,279
I've been waiting for you, Ryo.

296
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:41,258
Ms. Sara! You can't read Mr. Saeba's
mind any more! Understand?

297
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,021
Wait, wait for me. What's the matter?

298
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,829
What a bad disguise.

299
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,929
I guess she completely hates
you now, Mr. Saeba.

300
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,575
But does Sara read other people's
minds all day?

301
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:08,153
No, if she read other people's minds all day
while she was surrounded by bad relatives,

302
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,589
she would have become insane.

303
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,856
So she usually closes her mind, to prevent
other people's minds from floating into hers.

304
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,301
But while she is sleeping,
her mind is off guard

305
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,735
and her relatives' minds float into hers.


306
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,374
The reason we left the mansion was that,
the night before, she had a nightmare.

307
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:34,179
She was very frightened, probably because
evil minds floated into hers.

308
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,681
She said that she didn't want to be there,

309
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,916
that somebody would kill her,
and she was so upset.

310
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,685
That's why we...

311
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,654
Then, have you actually been targeted?

312
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,555
No.

313
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,957
No?

314
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,983
Then it's not certain that you were
actually targeted by someone, is it?

315
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,861
Yes, Ms. Sara was in great danger.

316
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:56,268
That night, when the master passed away,

317
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,361
Ms. Sara had a very bad nightmare.

318
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,407
Sara, run!

319
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,621
Let me have that girl.

320
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,853
Back off, both of you.

321
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,233
Mr. Saeba...

322
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,270
Get out of my way.

323
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,999
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

324
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,474
Can you see this?

325
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,044
Are you showing off your Ray-Ban
sunglasses that don't fit you at all?

326
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,846
You jerk!

327
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,949
I guess you're not the type to understand
unless someone teaches you.

328
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,110
Who, you?

329
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,824
What did you say I couldn't see?

330
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,029
I can only see you looking disgusting.

331
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,972
What?!

332
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,071
Hurry up and get in, brother!

333
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,111
That was a quick getaway!

334
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,056
Mr. Saeba!

335
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,153
It's okay, now.

336
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,062
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

337
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,529
Wow!

338
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,298
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

339
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,801
No problem.

340
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,402
Well, let's go back.

341
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,393
I'm afraid that someone might
try to get us again.

342
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,540
Is that all?

343
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,772
What is it?

344
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,606
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

345
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,304
I wonder what's going on
recently with Ms. Sara?

346
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,873
She's very close to Mr. Saeba all the time.

347
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,944
I don't think it's a problem. Since she's
not far from Ryo, it's easy to guard her.

348
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,639
But it's too much.

349
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,849
Ms. Sara might have fallen
in love with Mr. Saeba.

350
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,916
No way!

351
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,519
Yes, kids these days mature at an early age.

352
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,010
She's eleven and this is her first love.
It's late for her age.

353
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,759
I'm sure she's playing baby to Ryo,
just like her father.

354
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,750
Does he look like her dad in some way?

355
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,661
Not at all, my master didn't look like
a pervert like him at all!

356
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,192
This is a picture Ms. Sara took
of my master and me together.

357
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,875
Oh my, how gorgeous!
He was very handsome.

358
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,543
I like him. He's my type.

359
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,746
Then why don't you become Sara's mother?

360
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,045
I want Akiko to be my partner.

361
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,887
I'm so sorry that I'm a useless partner.

362
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,354
No!

363
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,389
Sara!

364
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,051
No, you can't be mean to Mr. Saeba!

365
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:13,732
You too, Ms. Kaori.

366
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,200
You too, Ms. Kaori.
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

367
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,736
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

368
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,695
Ms. Kaori also loves Mr. Saeba!
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

369
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:27,434
But I couldn't do so

370
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:37,951
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

371
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:44,351
You don't know the reason I'm here

372
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:59,277
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

373
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,644
I wouldn't have let you go

374
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:10,920
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

375
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:17,161
Everyday life is starting

376
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:27,437
In my mind, time has stopped

377
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:33,778
And a double-decker bus is passing

378
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,486
I guess Sara hates me.

379
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,021
She read your mind, didn't she?

380
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,890
If so, I have no idea when.

381
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,224
Well, you two need to talk.

382
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,693
The problem won't be solved if you run away
from it. Everything will stay the same.

383
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,062
Oh, no, are you going to the
Nishikujo mansion?

384
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,232
Sara has to become strong by
fighting against evil minds.

385
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,700
Yes, you are right.

386
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,336
Do your best, Sara! I'm going to
give you my bravery.

387
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,504
City Hunter 2:

388
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:03,108
"Mokkori Everywhere!
Ryo's Mind and an Esper girl (Part 2)"

389
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,871
If you miss it, you won't become strong.

390
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,102
Please look forward to the next episode
