1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,292
Ryo, it's for sure.

14
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,962
Sayuri Tachiki is Kaori's real sister.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,699
Mr. Saeba, why did you drag
my sister into this world?

16
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,641
Do you think Kaori is happy like this?

17
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,176
Wait a second.

18
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,270
Why don't you try to live with
Kaori for a week?

19
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,516
And after you see Kaori's current life,

20
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,974
then why don't we decide the
best answer for Kaori?

21
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,388
I understand.

22
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,049
I will do that.

23
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:09,117
Reunion After Twenty Years!
Please Look After My Sister, Mr. Saeba.
(Part 2)

24
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:19,205
It might be careless to go out even though
someone is trying to get me,

25
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,265
but I'm pretty sure that Mr. Saeba
is following us.

26
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,813
No, you're too persistent! Don't follow me!

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,215
Oh, well, now I'm sure he's following us.


28
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,451
Recently, there have been so many
sexual offenders around us.

29
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,043
I guess.

30
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,258
Wow, what beautiful skin you have!

31
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,893
I guess you don't put on a lot of makeup?

32
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,495
Your skin is intact so the foundation
spreads on your face so well!

33
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,165
Wow, this color looks good on you.

34
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,668
This lipstick color is in fashion this year.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

35
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,404
Ms. Sayuri, what is this all about?

36
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,406
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

37
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,308
You may say so, but...

38
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,578
Now, don't turn your head.
Close your mouth.

39
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,045
Excuse me.

40
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,642
What's going to happen?

41
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,852
Ms. Kaori, did you put it on?

42
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:10,557
Yes, but I'm a little embarrassed.

43
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,252
These are your shoes.

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,627
High heels?

45
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,529
Now, stand up in front of this mirror.

46
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,996
Oh, yes.

47
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,194
Is this me?

48
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,669
Wow!

49
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,675
How beautiful! Do you like it?

50
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,142
I guess.

51
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,745
Consider these presents from me.

52
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,114
No, you don't have to do this.

53
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,947
Don't worry. This is to thank you
for guarding me.

54
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,377
Right?

55
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,821
Really?

56
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,389
Thank you very much.

57
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,947
Well, I accept, then.

58
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,994
Let me change.

59
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,563
Oh, why? Let's go as you are.

60
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,589
On the street, people will stop and
look at you. You look fabulous!

61
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,892
But I can't guard you in these clothes.

62
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,309
Ryo told me not to wear feminine outfits
when I need to do something.

63
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,234
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,613
Ms. Kaori...

65
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,560
He's so cruel! Dressing up is
a woman's natural right,

66
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,222
but Mr. Saeba took it away from Kaori!

67
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,132
Hey, are you offended?

68
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,801
Ms. Sayuri, why are you so kind to me?

69
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,671
Ms. Kaori, actually, I...

70
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,206
I have a younger sister, but we had
to separate when I was little.

71
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:47,987
I think she must be about the
same age as you now.

72
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,956
That's why I can't leave you alone.

73
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,218
Is that so?

74
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,261
Ms. Kaori!

75
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,497
Ms. Kaori, I...

76
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,639
Who are you?!

77
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,106
Be quiet!

78
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,042
Hurry up and get in the car!

79
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,240
Mr. Saeba!

80
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,352
Right? Let's go. Just for a cup
of coffee or something!

81
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,154
No, cut it out!

82
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,678
I won't let you go until you agree.

83
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,220
Oh, no!

84
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,542
Let me go! Hey!

85
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,544
Shut up! Be quiet and get in here!
Let me go! Hey!

86
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,205
Ouch! Hey! Ouch!


87
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,981
What are you doing to us?! You jerk!

88
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,279
We're not some kind of luggage!

89
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,590
Who is that other loud woman?

90
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,259
I don't know, but she was
with the Chief Editor.

91
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,887
I brought them together, because I didn't
want her to make a lot of noise.

92
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:09,035
I guess it's okay. I don't think she can
disrupt our plan. Continue.

93
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,470
Yes, Sir.

94
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,472
I already let the Editorial Department
of Weekly News

95
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,305
know that we kidnapped their Chief Editor.

96
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,745
The only thing left to do now

97
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:22,281
is wait until they give in to our demands,
and stop publishing the article.

98
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,083
Good!

99
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,152
But, boss, without going through
all this trouble,

100
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,053
wouldn't it have been easier just to
kill the Chief Editor?

101
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,553
Our clients requested that we not
make a big deal out of this.

102
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,203
It's my fault that Kaori got dragged into this.

103
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,699
No, it's pointless to say
something like that now.

104
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:53,000
For now, I should cheer Kaori up
as her older sister.

105
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,216
Ms. Kaori, don't get so depressed.

106
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,151
We'll be all right, I'm sure.

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,028
Do you want to eat rice balls too, Ms. Sayuri?

108
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,699
When you're hungry, you can't fight, right?

109
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,328
Don't worry! I promise I'll
get you out of here.

110
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,975
Ms. Kaori, is the reason you're so calm

111
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,705
because you believe Mr. Saeba
will come to rescue us?

112
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,649
But it's his fault that we got kidnapped!

113
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,120
He was guarding us while
trying to hide from us,

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,216
but at the time we were kidnapped,
he was hitting on a woman!

115
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,996
Oh, you knew Ryo was protecting us,
didn't you?

116
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:55,007
If we were kidnapped while Ryo wasn't
there, I would have been upset,

117
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,465
but he was close to us so don't worry.

118
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,248
Even though he was hunting for
a girl while guarding us,

119
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,083
there's no way he could have lost us.

120
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,551
It's better to think that he made it
happen on purpose.

121
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:13,351
For example, he might have done it to
find the kidnappers' base quickly.

122
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,602
No way, I can't believe it.

123
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,804
Even if you're right, he's a cruel man.

124
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,773
You're just an assistant but he lets you
go on such dangerous missions!

125
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:32,267
No, it's because he knows it isn't
dangerous at all. I know that.

126
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,074
You're wrong.

127
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,721
I can't believe that you trust
someone like him.

128
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,690
Mr. Saeba makes you unhappy.

129
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,520
Ms. Kaori, I have something to tell you.

130
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,026
We might be killed here,
so I have to tell you now.

131
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,866
I told you that I have a younger sister,
living separately, didn't I?

132
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,973
The younger sister...

133
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,345
She is...

134
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:13,218
It's you! You're my sister!

135
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,411
No way, Ms. Sayuri. Indeed, you're the
Chief Editor of Weekly News.

136
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,847
You can joke around in a situation
like this! Great!

137
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,950
Kaori, listen!

138
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,114
Yes, Ma'am. I know you're trying to
calm me down. I'm fine.

139
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,624
There's a transmitter hidden in my blouse,

140
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:56,462
so Ryo will get here by following
the signal. Take it easy.

141
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,431
Kaori, you're wearing a sweatshirt today.

142
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,466
Oops!

143
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,811
This is a transmitter!

144
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,278
Who did this?!

145
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,559
Anyway, I know Ryo will be here
so take it easy.

146
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,893
What are you going to do now?

147
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,353
They made a big mistake in
not checking my bag.

148
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,630
Ready, go!

149
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,677
This!

150
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,178
Ms. Kaori!

151
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,669
This is stronger than I thought. Now...

152
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,651
Hey, what the hell are you doing?! Be quiet!

153
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,820
Oh, what good timing! Can you hold this?

154
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,584
Okay? Hold it steady. I'm going to pull it.

155
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,458
Ready, go!

156
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:05,059
Good, it came off. This pin was
very tight. Thanks.

157
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,490
Pin? Came off?

158
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,002
What?!

159
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,031
Duck, Ms. Sayuri!

160
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,067
What was that noise?!

161
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,603
I guess that's my trustworthy
assistant getting violent.

162
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,207
What?

163
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:29,221
Oh, long time no see, boss of Unryu Kai!

164
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,348
That voice, I'm sure you are...

165
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,190
That voice, I'm sure you are...

166
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,405
If I take one step forward, nobody
will be able to stop me.

167
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,134
You can see my gun, can't you?

168
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,701
No, I can't.

169
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,682
You!

170
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,950
Jerk! Who the hell are you?!

171
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,250
I'm gonna kick you outta here!

172
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,418
Wait! Cut it out!
I'm gonna kick you outta here!

173
00:11:59,418 --> 00:11:59,679
Wait! Cut it out!

174
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,429
What was that noise?

175
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,260
I think it came from the holding cell.

176
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,999
Kaori...

177
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,297
In this situation, I have no choice!

178
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,503
You kidnapped Kaori on purpose even
though you knew she was my assistant?

179
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,852
That noisy, well, the active girl?

180
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,654
Of course not. If I had known that,
I wouldn't have...

181
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,758
I see. Then if you accept my request,

182
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,090
I might be able to pretend that I
didn't see anything this time.

183
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,825
Yes, Sir, anything you say.

184
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,067
Who told you to kidnap Sayuri?

185
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,058
You'll tell me, won't you? Right?

186
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,909
I told you that you shouldn't carry
a weapon to kill people!

187
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,843
What are you saying?

188
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,620
What a surprise! This one is real.

189
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,823
You snuck out of the holding cell
and you're carrying this.

190
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,450
I guess you're not an ordinary
woman, are you?

191
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,097
I have to keep you alive, Chief Editor.

192
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,564
However, you're nothing but trouble.

193
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,103
I guess you are going to die
by your own gun.

194
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,070
Ms. Kaori!

195
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,381
Ryo!

196
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,507
Mr. Saeba?

197
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,684
Boss, what's going on?!

198
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:44,089
Well, anyway, you have to stay away
from those people.

199
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,056
Boss?!

200
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,496
What a naughty girl!

201
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,624
You could have been quiet and waited
for me. You're such a tomboy!

202
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,623
Ryo!

203
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:06,545
It happened because you were picking up
a girl at the critical time!

204
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,147
Wait, Kaori! You'll understand when I explain!

205
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,215
Don't waste your breath!

206
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,616
I promise I won't do it again! I've changed!

207
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,151
I can't believe anything you say!

208
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,153
It's true! Please believe me!

209
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,321
No, I don't believe you!

210
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,117
I said it's true!

211
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,195
We made the Unryu Kai boss confess which
company was pulling the strings,

212
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,832
so they won't bother you or
your office ever again.

213
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,800
Ryo punished them badly.

214
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,604
Mr. Saeba is incredible, isn't he?

215
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,406
I can't believe that he made them
withdraw so quickly.

216
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,009
He's only useful for those situations.

217
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,510
Only?

218
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,378
But I think they were more
afraid of you than me.

219
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,386
Well, everything is done now.
Congratulations! Right?

220
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,217
The real solution is about to start.

221
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,922
Incredible.

222
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,457
I see you can manipulate your gun
anyway you want.

223
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,792
Thanks a lot.

224
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,727
Are you observing murder training even
though you don't like guns?

225
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,331
I don't know much about shooting
because I'm not a professional,

226
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,169
but it didn't look like you were practicing
killing people this time.

227
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:43,604
I heard the sound of the gun as if it were
to calm the scream of your mind.

228
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,078
A sad scream.

229
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,949
Oh, indeed, you're the Chief Editor.
That was so literary.

230
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,042
I am so embarrassed.

231
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,989
Mr. Saeba...

232
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,835
Ms. Sayuri, what do you want to tell me?

233
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,995
Nothing much.

234
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,167
How beautiful!

235
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,409
Look! From here the town looks beautiful.

236
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,283
I really want to remember this
night scenery in my mind.

237
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,051
This might be the last chance I get.

238
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,553
Last chance?

239
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,322
I am scheduled to leave for New York.

240
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,393
My work has been noticed and the New York
head office called me to work there.

241
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,764
Great! Going to the New York head office?!
Congratulations, Ms. Sayuri!

242
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,322
Thank you, Ms. Kaori.

243
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,936
I don't know when I'll be coming back
to Japan after that.

244
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,463
That's why I wanted to find
my sister before then.

245
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,008
I would like to go to New York with her.

246
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,448
You are...

247
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,006
You're my sister.

248
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,088
I told you when we were in the
holding cell, didn't I?

249
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,127
Just for a little while we lived together

250
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,430
and I felt as if you were my sister,

251
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,266
and I really wished you were my sister.

252
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,394
I wanted to believe it, so that's why I said it.

253
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,110
Hey, why don't you come to
New York with me?

254
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,880
I really feel as if you were my sister.

255
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,178
Why don't we live over there as sisters?

256
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,888
What am I talking about?! I'm sorry.
It's a bad joke.

257
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,424
I know you can't leave this town where
your brother rests in peace.

258
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,835
And you can't leave the person
you love, can you?

259
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,963
Oh, no, I don't care about Ryo.

260
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,169
I didn't say anything about
Mr. Saeba at all, did I?

261
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,777
Goodnight.

262
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,506
Oh, no...

263
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,289
Why?

264
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,820
Because I think Kaori is happy as she is now.

265
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:21,164
The life she's lived, and the life
she will live are happy.

266
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:28,104
The truth she knows is more true
than the one I know.

267
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,276
There's no need for two truths to co-exist.

268
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,579
So I shouldn't tell her anything.

269
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,241
For both Kaori, and for myself as well.

270
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,952
Therefore, Mr. Saeba,

271
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,080
you will take responsibility
for Kaori, won't you?!

272
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,655
What? Well...

273
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,452
You cheater! You're trying to avoid
the subject by laughing!

274
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,092
But you didn't deny it either this time.

275
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,497
Good, I accept it as your answer.

276
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,507
But if you make Kaori unhappy, I'll come
back from New York and get her.

277
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,641
I'm going home now.

278
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,382
There is no need for me to be protected here.

279
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,860
Younger sister...

280
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,487
Older sister...

281
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,401
If I go to New York,

282
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,337
who would keep Ryo, the pervert,
from getting out of control?

283
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,134
Right, brother?

284
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,786
I'm sorry. I couldn't help you at all.

285
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,847
Oh, no, Ms. Saeko, you helped me a lot.

286
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,755
I heard that you didn't tell Kaori
that she was your sister.

287
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,657
I wasn't confident that I could
control my feelings.

288
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:06,297
If I told her, I wouldn't be able to stop
myself from taking her with me.

289
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,407
I would separate those two by force.

290
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,346
Ms. Sayuri!

291
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,910
Good, I made it!

292
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,586
Ms. Kaori, you came all the way here
to see me off?

293
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:29,787
Because you left without saying
anything that night.

294
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,823
Thank you. You look so beautiful.

295
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,368
I'm embarrassed to wear feminine
clothes like this.

296
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,303
I wore my coat to hide these,

297
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,433
but I really wanted you to see me
wearing these clothes again.

298
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,604
Because you chose them, and thought
of me as your real sister.

299
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,116
I wish I had a nice older sister like you.


300
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,155
But you don't want me to feel like that.

301
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:01,956
Oh, no, no, I am so happy,
so very happy to hear that!

302
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,129
Ms. Sayuri!

303
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:09,801
Final call for the flight to New York.

304
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,204
Passengers, please head to Gate 15.


305
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,539
I guess I have to go.

306
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,370
Thank you so much. Take care.

307
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,970
You too, Ms. Sayuri. Good luck.

308
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,117
So long.

309
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,856
Ms. Sayuri!

310
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,761
Goodbye, sister.

311
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,933
Kaori...

312
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:05,318
Hey, Ryo, Kaori might know the truth.

313
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:10,856
I don't know. The truth might not
be the truth for Kaori.

314
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,365
Kaori herself is the one who
decides what the truth is.

315
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,634
Kaori herself is the one who
decides what the truth is.
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

316
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,302
Right?
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

317
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,999
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

318
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,901
But I couldn't do so

319
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:37,412
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

320
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:43,817
You don't know the reason I'm here

321
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:58,744
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

322
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,111
I wouldn't have let you go

323
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:10,386
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

324
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:16,627
Everyday life is starting

325
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:26,903
In my mind, time has stopped

326
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:33,244
And a double-decker bus is passing

327
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,988
Spend the night guarding a girl from
a man who wants to get her?

328
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,891
No, not only one. One after another,
continuously bothering her.

329
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,893
Why is she so attractive like that?

330
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,095
She's just a high school girl, isn't she?

331
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,430
She doesn't understand it either.

332
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,031
I don't like it.

333
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,333
Her grandfather might be hiding
something from her, right?

334
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,437
I wonder? Well, why don't you
date her for now?

335
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,771
City Hunter 2:

336
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,974
"Proposal From a Seventeen Year Old
Suspicious Date Panic (Part 1)

337
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,601
If you miss it, I'm going to get you.

338
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:08,668
Please look forward to the next episode
