1
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,351
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,919
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:40,407
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,673
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,475
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,378
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,728
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,461
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,664
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,136
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:28,847
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,836
Frankly speaking, I have to say no.

13
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,602
We usually have a lot of trouble when
we accept your requests.

14
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,742
I'm just an agent this time.

15
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,073
The client is over there.

16
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,379
His name is Keiichi Kashiwagi.

17
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,614
He's an actor.

18
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,911
An actor?

19
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:01,588
Also, he's a witness in an incident
which is currently in court.

20
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,887
He's very important and he could
affect the verdict.

21
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,129
The next session will be in six days and
he'll be on the witness stand.

22
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,189
I want you to guard him until then.

23
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,261
Guard? Is somebody trying to kill him?

24
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,599
Anyway, as you know, I wonder if Ryo,
will accept guarding a man?

25
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,649
Please help me.

26
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,447
I don't have anybody to ask except you.

27
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,518
Oh, what a gorgeous man!

28
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:43,418
Targeted Witness!
A Dangerous Beauty Dressed Up Like a Man
(Part 1)

29
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,432
I can't hear you.

30
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,068
Please? Just this time, please?

31
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,403
I can't hear you.

32
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,539
Damn, what a jerk you are!

33
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,073
No matter what we say, he won't hear us.

34
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,575
Then, there's only one last thing to try.

35
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,167
I can't hear!

36
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,446
This girl is...

37
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,315
Yes, yes, this girl is?

38
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,618
She is the sister of Keiichi Kashiwagi,
and her name is Keiko.

39
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,987
If you accept being
Mr. Kashiwagi's bodyguard,

40
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,388
she says that she'll go out with you.

41
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,391
What a ridiculous story!

42
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:19,025
Brother, please relax. I will make
Keiko happy, I promise.

43
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,701
What a cute sister you have!

44
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,761
You're her brother, I know, but
you really look the same.

45
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,106
Twins!

46
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,008
They're twins, so it's nothing special
to look the same.

47
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,343
Right, Keiichi?

48
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,970
Information Analysis Room

49
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,643
He's exactly the same as Ms. Saeko told me.

50
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,918
Six days is so long.

51
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,883
I wonder if I can act like this without
being found out by them?

52
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,593
Hey, Mr. Kashiwagi is really
a cute guy, isn't he?

53
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,862
Wow, do you like that type?
Did you fall in love with him?

54
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,331
Don't be silly!

55
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,166
Look! Your face turned red.

56
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,100
Shut up, jerk!

57
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,307
It's painful, but I have to suffer.

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,718
I have to be patient until I go to bed.

59
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:16,018
Then I'll be able to take off this body
bandage and relax in bed.

60
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:24,230
By the way, the man who is trying to
get you must be a big wig, right?

61
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,960
Because he hired a famous
underworld assassin.

62
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,603
You know the man who was
arrested last month

63
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,764
for smuggling and selling
drugs, don't you?

64
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,810
That man is also the chairman of the
fan club of a famous actress,

65
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,472
who is in the same production I am.

66
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:46,080
One time, I happened to see them
partying with drugs.

67
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,717
Since that time, someone has been
trying to kill you, hasn't he?

68
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,297
I was afraid of becoming involved with those
matters so I didn't tell anybody about it.

69
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,892
However, that man knew I saw it.

70
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,936
Even if I say you have to protect yourself,

71
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,239
you wouldn't be able to do it
with such skinny arms.

72
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,900
You could probably only hold chopsticks.

73
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,711
But your chest is thick enough.

74
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,845
Your body figure is strange, isn't it?

75
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,312
No!

76
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,774
No?!

77
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,261
I am sorry, but the futon set for the
guest is at the cleaners, so...

78
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:34,434
Oh, no, I don't want to share
a bed with some guy.

79
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,169
It can't be helped.

80
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,604
If you don't like the idea, would you
like to sleep with Kaori?

81
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,265
Sure, that's better than this.

82
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,781
Well, I was just kidding. It's a joke.

83
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,050
Of course. Well, you'll sleep
here, won't you?

84
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,517
Sure...

85
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,522
Well, goodnight, then.

86
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,320
I might have missed a great
opportunity, right?

87
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,928
Who made you so happy and excited?

88
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,726
Nobody!

89
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,771
What's the matter?

90
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,806
Hurry up and change.

91
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:14,974
These are your pajamas.

92
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,378
I... Well, I have to go to the bathroom
before I go to bed.

93
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,179
What? Bathroom?

94
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,010
You are just like a little kid.

95
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,981
Information Analysis Room

96
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,685
I'm in trouble.

97
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,920
I have no choice except to sleep
with this body bandage on.

98
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,615
What suffering!

99
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,925
Sorry to keep you waiting.

100
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,519
What? You changed in the
bathroom, didn't you?

101
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,087
Yes, I did.

102
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,532
My pajamas are too big for you as I thought.

103
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,560
Why don't you sleep in your underpants?

104
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,036
Underpants?!

105
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,975
Hey, I'm going to turn off the light.

106
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,143
Hurry up and get in bed.

107
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,210
Yes!

108
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,441
Please God, please protect me.

109
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,660
He scared me.

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,127
It's just his snoring.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,425
Ms. Keiko's thigh...

112
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,572
What kind of dream is that?!

113
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,096
You pervert!

114
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,311
Just like the rumor, awake or
asleep, he's a lecher.

115
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,182
What is this?!

116
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,241
Damn, why can't he sleep without
causing any trouble?!

117
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,411
Ms. Keiko...

118
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,578
What?!

119
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,164
Why the hell do I keep dreaming
about someone bothering me

120
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,565
while I am in a good mood with Keiko?!

121
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,638
Damn, I can't predict what this guy
will do even while he's sleeping.

122
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,503
I can't sleep in a situation like this.

123
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,212
Is it already morning?

124
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,181
I guess I slept a little.

125
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,489
Ms. Keiko's boobs...

126
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,233
What the hell?

127
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,200
You pervert!

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,102
What the hell are you touching?!

129
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,569
Touching?

130
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,765
Oh, sorry, I was having an
extremely good dream.

131
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:34,113
But I wonder if a man has a soft part,
just like a woman's breast?

132
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,011
Doki!

133
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,582
No way...

134
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,952
Well, I see.

135
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,388
I was touching your balls.

136
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,326
Based on the feeling, yours are
extra large sizes, aren't they?

137
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,501
I wonder if something's wrong with him?

138
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,170
Keiichi doesn't seem okay and he
doesn't have much appetite.

139
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,231
Well, I guess he can be gloomy since he's
kept himself in the house for three days now.

140
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,069
I'm afraid I'm going to become
neurotic while I'm here.

141
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,015
Well, I guess so.

142
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,617
Hey, Ryo, why don't you take him
out somewhere today?

143
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,119
Don't be silly.

144
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,322
Why do I need to go out on
a date with a man?!

145
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,290
What?

146
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,192
When you have a female client, you usually
try to take her out all the time!

147
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,853
Well, I won't ask you anything!

148
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,165
Hey, Mr. Keiichi, I would like to go
shopping for clothes now,

149
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,395
so why don't you come with me?

150
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,070
Ms. Kaori...

151
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,607
No, you can't.

152
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,175
Why not?

153
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,444
You don't want to go out with him,
that's why I'm trying to...

154
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,005
Well, if something happens, can
you protect him by yourself?

155
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,475
Well...

156
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,319
Be patient.

157
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,914
But if you really want to go out, you
could disguise yourself as a woman.

158
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,026
Yes, that's it!

159
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,529
If he disguises himself as a woman,
we can fool the enemy.

160
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,461
Right, Mr. Keiichi?

161
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh, no.

162
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,400
I disguised myself as a man to
hoodwink the enemy, but...

163
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,975
Anyway, you're silly, Kaori.

164
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,376
It's impossible for a man to pretend
to be a woman well.

165
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,957
How about that, Ryo?

166
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,660
When he dresses up like a woman,
he looks just like his sister, Keiko.

167
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,795
I'm so surprised.

168
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,431
He did his own makeup.

169
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,433
He's an actor indeed.

170
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:39,271
Wow, looking at you standing side
by side, you two look like lovers.

171
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,364
Oh, no.

172
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,244
Let's go, Mr. Keiichi.

173
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,977
Stay like that for a while.

174
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,554
Ms. Kaori, I'm scared to go outside like this.

175
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,722
You'll be fine.

176
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,316
I'm stronger than Ryo when I need to be.

177
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,229
I didn't expect that he'd become
so beautiful like that.

178
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,789
I should have gone with her on a date.

179
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,970
I'm stupid. He looks like a woman,
but he's a man!

180
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,631
However, I can't forget about them.

181
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,663
I'm going to follow them.

182
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,349
This is a date, isn't it?

183
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,250
Even though other people think
we are both women...

184
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,155
Hey, look, look at them.

185
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,089
They look like a perfect pair
of lovers, don't they?

186
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,427
Ms. Kaori, are you all right?

187
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,494
Shoot! I hate this.

188
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,864
I lost as a woman against you,
Mr. Keiichi, and you're a man!

189
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,433
What are you talking about?

190
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,034
You're cute, Ms. Kaori.

191
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,269
I have a good idea!

192
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,471
I will find you some clothes, Kaori,

193
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,464
and coordinate them perfectly so men can't
help themselves when they see you.

194
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,579
You really look like you're
a woman, Mr. Keiichi.

195
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,847
No way.

196
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,180
I'm an actor and it's a piece of cake
for me to act like this.

197
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,875
Well, hurry up, let's go!

198
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,637
Look, this is it.

199
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,739
This fits perfectly on you, Ms. Kaori!

200
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,841
It's really good on you. So cute!

201
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,275
Really?

202
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,477
Let's buy a skirt too.

203
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,178
You look good when you wear pants

204
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,146
but I'm sure you look good
when you wear a skirt too.

205
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,313
Well, you look good with that on! Great!

206
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,217
Mr. Keiichi, you're a man, but you're good
at shopping at sales, aren't you?

207
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:48,634
Well, because men go to sales for
designer brand items nowadays.

208
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,195
I got used to going shopping.

209
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,710
I found them.

210
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:04,706
Anyway, he's so cute even though
I know he's a man...

211
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,520
I wonder if I might be going into
a dangerous relationship?

212
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,989
Attention please.

213
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,514
Now, we're going to start the time sale.

214
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,829
For thirty minutes all items in this
wagon will be fifty percent off!

215
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,023
Hurry up!

216
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,100
Look! Those are fifty percent off!

217
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,034
What?

218
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,602
Never mind. Stay here.

219
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,239
Geez, even considering that he's an actor,

220
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,375
it's amazing that he looks like
nothing but a woman.

221
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,208
I'd think we're just two females shopping.

222
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,447
Wow, incredible! Is this really half off?


223
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,177
Yes, please touch them and feel the quality.

224
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,193
Well, I guess it's okay.

225
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,559
He looks like he's enjoying it.

226
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,127
A molester! Someone touched my butt.

227
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,778
Wow, let me touch. Let me caress!

228
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,115
Hey, jerk! What the hell are you thinking?!

229
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,276
Same to you! You are disqualified
to be a bodyguard.

230
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,777
Look.

231
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,923
The grenade is placed firmly at
the bottom of the wagon

232
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,593
and the pin is attached to the clothes.

233
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,828
If I didn't show up as a pervert,

234
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,456
one of the clients would have
pulled the clothes and...

235
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,248
Oops! Pull yourself together!

236
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,549
Nothing to worry about now.

237
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,813
That guy! He's a molester!

238
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,942
Wait, you pervert!

239
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,288
Pervert?!

240
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,522
Hey, wait!

241
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,921
Open the door!

242
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,728
I guess Mr. Keiichi was badly shocked.

243
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,034
It's shame on him that he got sick
after a little incident like that.

244
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,993
It's also your fault to have taken him
out without listening to me.

245
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,876
Mr. Keiichi!

246
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,284
How do I look?

247
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,252
These clothes are the ones
you chose for me.

248
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,450
Well, I wanted you to see me
wearing them first.

249
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,691
Yes, you look very good in those, Ms. Kaori.

250
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,863
He smiled.

251
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,161
I hope he will be cheerful.

252
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,966
I wish I could go outside wearing
nice clothes like those.

253
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,735
Oops, he looks sad again...

254
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,608
Mr. Keiichi!

255
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,575
Yes!

256
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,110
You shouldn't be like that.

257
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,980
Kaori tried to cheer you up by wearing a
mini-skirt even though it's not good on her,

258
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,549
and by using her sex appeal even though
she doesn't have any.

259
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,952
Since you're a man, you should
respond to her sincerely,

260
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,920
and try to get excited by her efforts.

261
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,824
Kaori, you shouldn't be like this either.

262
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:03,454
You have to dress sexier,
or nobody will get excited.

263
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,655
That's more than enough!

264
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,239
Mr. Keiichi, since you're a man,

265
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:18,073
you have to protect yourself by yourself
once something happens to you.

266
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,853
See, it's easy.

267
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,989
You're a man so do what I told you.

268
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:35,757
But Mr. Saeba, why do I have to
dress up like a woman then?

269
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,132
Because I can concentrate better
when teaching you.

270
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,600
Hand to hand, to teach you cordially.

271
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,769
It should be more enjoyable for
a student, shouldn't it?

272
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,771
No, it's not. Let me change.

273
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,898
Don't say things like that.

274
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,075
Let me change!

275
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,736
Please...

276
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,547
Sorry to keep you waiting.

277
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,848
A man should be like this.

278
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,591
But that shirt is too big for you, isn't it?

279
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,321
I can't exercise with that tight body bandage.

280
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,161
Well, let's start!

281
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,478
Ouch, my hand hurts.

282
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,414
It's not cute for a man to act like a baby.

283
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,938
Hey, keep firing.

284
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,016
Hey, straighten your back, and also
extend your arms straight.

285
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,656
What the hell are you doing?
You have no athletic sense.

286
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,998
Hey, don't hit me.

287
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,834
Then aim properly, you idiot!

288
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,003
Shoot, when he teaches a man,

289
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,766
his attitude is totally different from
when he teaches a woman.

290
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,881
Out of the question.

291
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,348
Hey, one more.

292
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,318
I don't like this Spartan training.

293
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,031
You're dull, aren't you?

294
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,732
I don't want to hold a man.

295
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,968
Don't be blown off your stance
every time you fire. Damn!

296
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,636
Oh, I can't do it any more.

297
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,205
My hand is numb.

298
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,340
Please let me take a rest for
a little while, Mr. Saeba.

299
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,641
Hell no!

300
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,877
You haven't hit any targets yet.

301
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,613
Until you hit the target, you can't rest or eat.


302
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,347
Oh, no!

303
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,178
Shut up and continue!

304
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,513
What the hell is that look?

305
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,391
Mr. Saeba, is this really a
special training for me?

306
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,359
You might just want to be mean to me.

307
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,499
I know that Ms. Kaori likes me,

308
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,102
so you're jealous of me and
mean to me, aren't you?

309
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,162
I am right, right? You love Ms. Kaori, so...


310
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,979
Hurry up and shoot.

311
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,844
Yes, Sir!

312
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,384
Shoot, I know I'm right.

313
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,621
He talks about me like I'm not manly,
but he's jealous of me.

314
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,920
He's the one not being manly.

315
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,735
Mr. Saeba...

316
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:38,406
Every time I was blown off my stance when I
fired, Mr. Saeba was there every time.

317
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,747
Then he cares about me, doesn't he?

318
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,174
He caught me so I wouldn't get hurt.

319
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,576
I did it.

320
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,381
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

321
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,009
I... Thank you for your kindness
in helping me.

322
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,612
If something were to happen to you,
Kaori would be unhappy.

323
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:29,123
Well, I'm like a parent to Kaori, so...

324
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,864
Mr. Saeba, you're a playboy,
but unexpectedly,

325
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,933
you're awkward sometimes, aren't you?

326
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,969
No, well...

327
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,802
But I like a man like that.

328
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,876
Hey, don't let me go suddenly like this.

329
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,179
Because you said something disgusting.

330
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,704
I'm not interested in that kind of thing.
So disgusting...

331
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,613
But what I've just said was true.

332
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,052
I'm sure you would protect me.

333
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,983
Just like you caught me and protected
me many times today.

334
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,298
Don't look at me like that.

335
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,035
Good, that's all for today.

336
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,738
You improved and are able to hit the target.

337
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,174
As I told you, take out the remaining
bullets and clean the gun out.

338
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,372
Yes, but I think I used up all the bullets.

339
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,785
You hit the water supply pipe.

340
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,684
I'm so sorry!

341
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,698
It's better than hitting the gas supply.

342
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,768
That's why I told you to be very careful
when dealing with guns.

343
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,235
I am so sorry.

344
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,673
Here, hurry up and wipe up the water.

345
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,140
Thanks!

346
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,405
You...

347
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,585
Woman!

348
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:33,116
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

349
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,589
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

350
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:41,320
You skip dinner and eat diet food

351
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,459
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

352
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,871
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

353
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,204
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

354
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:03,309
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

355
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:12,387
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

356
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,292
Don't you, don't you know

357
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:20,665
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

358
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:28,504
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

359
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:34,404
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

360
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,420
You guys, since when are you
intimate like that?

361
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,055
This is men's friendship, which
women can't understand.

362
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,557
Don't even think about covering up.

363
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,359
You lost, pervert!

364
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,995
My dinner isn't worth as much as a man.

365
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,596
Don't get so excited, Kaori.

366
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,466
You get too mad and dishes get broken.

367
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,335
All of these, those are all your fault, Ryo!

368
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,537
City Hunter 2:

369
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,538
"Targeted Witness!

370
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,807
A Dangerous Beauty Dressed Up
Like a Man (Part 2)"

371
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,105
If you don't watch it, you'll become a pervert.

372
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,268
Please look forward to the next episode
