1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:21,996
Don't Die, Falcon!
Magnum with Love & Revenge (Part 1)

13
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,439
Wait, wait, wait! Don't run away from me,
bra!

14
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,206
You can't escape from me!
Come back to me!

15
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:43,396
Hi, Mr. Ryo, if you love my bra so much,
I'm going to give it to you.

16
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,160
So would you come take it off?

17
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:54,537
Oh, hurry up please, before the ring stops.

18
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,871
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

19
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,505
Give me your bra!

20
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,154
The giant mokkori babe has disappeared!

21
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,281
Where, where did she go?!

22
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,518
Was it a dream?

23
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,498
Who the hell are you calling me
in the middle of the night?!

24
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,490
The blonde lady has disappeared
because of you!

25
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,402
Ryo?

26
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,595
Umibozu?

27
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,407
What's the matter?

28
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,609
I want to offer you a job.

29
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,279
Job? Why didn't you call me after sunrise?

30
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,110
I'm talking about a blonde beauty!

31
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:43,348
Well, I can't say no to you,
Umibozu. I'll take it.

32
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,493
A woman named Kathleen Heywood is
staying at the Capital Hotel in Tokyo,

33
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,462
room number 904.

34
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,330
How old?

35
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,664
Eighteen!

36
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,724
Oh, eighteen?!

37
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,294
She is visiting Japan to sightsee.

38
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,640
Since this is her first visit, her parents
are worried about her

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,301
and asked me to escort her.

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,711
However, something has come up,
and I am not able to escort her.

41
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,015
I see, but it sounds like there is more to this.

42
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,984
If you don't like it, fine.
I will find somebody else.

43
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,254
Don't be hasty. Who said I didn't like it?

44
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,355
I will contact you later.

45
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,845
Hey, wait!

46
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,094
Damn! He hung up on me.
What a selfish guy!

47
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,907
Sightseeing with a blonde beauty! How nice!

48
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:45,177
He's making a big mistake if he thinks
he can work without me finding out.

49
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,274
Who is it?!

50
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,044
Room service. I brought your breakfast.

51
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,535
Breakfast? I didn't order any.

52
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,715
It must be some kind of mistake.
Take it back.

53
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,946
No, it's not a mistake.

54
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,883
Good morning, Ms. Kathleen.
This is the room service of love.

55
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,794
How did you get in here?!
The door was locked!

56
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,799
Yes, love is universal and no wall or door
can stop international mokkori.

57
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,597
I am Ryo Saeba, a substitute for Umibozu.

58
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,061
Umibozu?

59
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,342
She's only eighteen years old and almost
a target for a Lolita complex.

60
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,800
However, she has a great figure!
Foreign women are good, in my opinion.

61
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:50,249
Mr. Saeba, if you are a substitute for
Falcon, well, Umibozu,

62
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,717
why don't you hurry up and do your job?!

63
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,858
Indeed she is not Japanese.
She's very aggressive!

64
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,416
Well, any time!

65
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,296
Wow, what an impatient woman! I love her!

66
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,032
What?

67
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,000
Kathleen!

68
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:11,371
National
Shame

69
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,863
National
Shame
You national shame! Don't become an
international embarrassment for Japan!

70
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,942
No way! Why is Kaori here?

71
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,715
What we have here is a misunderstanding?

72
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,052
I was forced to accept the job by Umibozu!

73
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,321
So, you're telling me that you
took off all your clothes,

74
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,556
except for your underwear, for the job?

75
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,615
What you were asked to do was
take her sightseeing, wasn't it?

76
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,857
Take me sightseeing?

77
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:41,401
I am Kaori, his assistant. I'm sorry
that he has caused problems.

78
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,269
Yes, it's the difference in customs
between two countries.

79
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,138
It's just your hobby, isn't it?

80
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,439
I'm choking, choking!

81
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,340
Both of you, are you in the same
business as Mr. Umibozu?

82
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,710
Yes, we are.

83
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,911
Where did he go?

84
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,108
He called me and asked, so I
don't know where he is.

85
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,347
Kathleen!

86
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,158
When we go out, I like the outfit with
the slit like you're wearing now,

87
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,955
but I like this mini-dress better than that.

88
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,896
Also, we need to pay attention to
the color of your lingerie.

89
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,798
Oh, how cute!

90
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,197
I like this the most!

91
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,598
In order to escort clients, is it common to dig
through the client's belongings in Japan?

92
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:23,808
It's because we Japanese can't escort a
client without knowing the client well.

93
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,212
Are you saying it's a difference of
customs between countries?

94
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,979
Oh, yes, it is. When in Rome, do as the
Romans do, you know?

95
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,622
Hey, you, what excuses are you
going to make for these?

96
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,425
Well, once we go outside,
if she wants to change,

97
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,694
Japanese sizes are smaller
than foreigners, so...

98
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:45,186
Who the hell wants to change
underwear outside?!

99
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,512
Mokkori with a blonde girl!
Mokkori with a blonde girl!

100
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,486
This is a rare chance, but
Kaori ruined it. Damn!

101
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,922
That guy is...

102
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,594
Please enjoy yourselves.

103
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,295
Kaori, here, car key.

104
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,196
What?

105
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,959
Why don't you bring my car to the front?

106
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:23,302
It's your old-fashioned way to take her
out with you while I'm gone.

107
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,827
Recently, your plans have
been pretty transparent.

108
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,374
I can't help it. Since you
showed up so suddenly,

109
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,433
I didn't have time to think
of anything better.

110
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,142
Sorry, that's not going to work.
Go by yourself.

111
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,650
Here you go.

112
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,463
Thank you, Ma'am. Bye-bye.

113
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,133
Be careful.

114
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,623
Papa!

115
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,005
No, no, don't run. It's dangerous.

116
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,131
I'm fine.

117
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,874
She's so cute, isn't she?

118
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,978
Papa, hurry up, I want to go to
the amusement park!

119
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,977
Yes, baby. Let's go back to the room
and get ready now.

120
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,215
Ms. Kathleen, is something wrong?

121
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,384
Ms. Kaori, do you work with
Mr. Umibozu often?

122
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:27,391
Not so often, but we help
each other sometimes.

123
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,134
You should be careful.

124
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,866
No one knows when Mr. Umibozu
will betray them.

125
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,974
Umibozu will?

126
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,279
Mr. Saeba is late. What is he doing?

127
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,839
I'll go check, so please wait here.

128
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,016
Bye, Miss Watch-woman.

129
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,531
Dandy Jack?! When did you come to Japan?

130
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:03,434
Before any obstacles get in your way,
hurry up and complete the mission.

131
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:08,033
Dye this rose red, with the blood of Falcon.

132
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,951
Oh, my God! Kaori is not there.
What a chance!

133
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,158
Miss! Thank you very much for
a little while ago!

134
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,256
Bye-bye!

135
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,358
No!

136
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,686
You're okay now.

137
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,153
Asami!

138
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,789
Papa! Papa!

139
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,054
Asami, you're okay! I am so relieved!

140
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,691
What reflexes! You look like you've
had some special training.

141
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,001
That's none of your business!

142
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,070
Excuse me, but thank you very, very much.
You rescued my daughter.

143
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,941
Your name is Asami, right? Be careful, okay?

144
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,183
Yes, thank you very much.

145
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,516
Well, let's go before Kaori gets back.

146
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,325
As I thought, you're hiding in here!

147
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,999
You left us because you wanted to,
so why take it out on me?

148
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,866
You're hopeless. I can't be off
my guard for a second!

149
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,500
You're definitely a national shame!
I'm so embarrassed!

150
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,508
City Hunter, Ryo Saeba.

151
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,345
Falcon has dragged a troublesome man
into our business.

152
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,660
Kathleen is very religious, isn't she?

153
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,258
She goes to church even though
she's sightseeing.

154
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,060
What's the matter, Ryo? Ryo?!

155
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,674
Did you say something?

156
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,878
You, you're not still planning to take
her out with you, are you?

157
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,312
What? How do you know what I'm thinking?

158
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,481
Jerk!

159
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,844
But I wonder what she really is?

160
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,362
Father, last night, I tried to murder
a man for a reason.

161
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,824
However, I couldn't accomplish my mission.

162
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,531
I was able to hurt him, but he ran into
a thick fog and disappeared.

163
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:59,303
That's good. God guided you. If you kill,
you go against God's will.

164
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:04,650
But that man has gone against God.
Why he hasn't been punished?

165
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,051
He will be punished. God knows everything.

166
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,583
But it's been eight years. What's God
been doing those eight years?

167
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,887
After I kill Falcon, I will seek the answer.

168
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,008
Too long...

169
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:36,437
Hey, Ryo! She told us to wait here!
Damn, what a perverted man!

170
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,326
Do you know Ms. Kathleen?

171
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,031
Yes, I do.

172
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,766
I see.

173
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,464
God, please help her.

174
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,413
What? What does he mean?

175
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,611
I don't know, but what I do know,
is that she is no longer here.

176
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,891
Kaori, go back to the hotel and find out
whether she is back or not.

177
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,019
Where are you going, Ryo?
Not to chase her.

178
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,196
I have to find something out. I will be
back after I finish my business.

179
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,172
Ryo!

180
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,805
Hey, Ryo! Where are you going without
me, leaving me in the rain?!

181
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,992
Welcome! Umibozu is not home.

182
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,862
You, why are you here? You know what
I plan to do, don't you?

183
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,801
No, but when I saw your incredible
ability in action,

184
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:40,397
and when you called Umibozu "Falcon",
I knew something was going on.

185
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:45,210
I named him Umibozu. He was
called Falcon before that,

186
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,304
and sightseeing travellers
should not know that.

187
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,516
Don't try to trick me. It won't work.

188
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,279
Knowing what you know, it's impossible
to guess my plans.

189
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,609
Yes, one more thing.

190
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,422
Don't move!

191
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,753
It's nothing dangerous.

192
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,123
Look!

193
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,922
You still have those?

194
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,493
Listen, look at this area very carefully
where your thigh touches.

195
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,094
The seam of this area is slightly opened.

196
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,566
That's because you keep the gun
inside of your thigh.

197
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,070
You are not just an ordinary man, are you?

198
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,606
My name is Ryo Saeba,
I'm also called City Hunter.

199
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,584
I see. You are the City Hunter.
I've often heard about you.

200
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,844
Would you tell me why you tried to
kill Umibozu, if you don't mind?

201
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,587
Where are you putting my panties?!

202
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,962
Damn, I shouldn't have shown them to her.

203
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,034
Falcon!

204
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,306
Kathleen...

205
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:53,210
I'll tell you, Mr. Saeba, why I am
trying to kill Falcon!

206
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,880
Eight years ago,

207
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,442
he shot my father in the back,
even though he was unarmed!

208
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,286
For eight years, I've endured tough
training in the hope of killing Falcon.

209
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,852
Finally, I saw Falcon last night,
but he ran away.

210
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:17,160
He doesn't intend to fight fairly.
He is a chicken, and he is a coward!

211
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,306
There must be a reason why
he ran away from you.

212
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,866
He is not a man who runs away when
someone challenges him.

213
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,439
Because he feels guilty, that's
why he can't face me!

214
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,684
Calm down, Kathleen.
I know you can't kill him.

215
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,329
I can! I've been trained as
a professional killer!

216
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,869
It's not that easy to shoot a person.

217
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,962
Actually, it's more difficult than you think.

218
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:03,042
Falcon, I will close the curtain myself
and make this play of revenge end.

219
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,786
Watch out!

220
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,591
You die, Falcon!

221
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,180
Kathleen, Umibozu!

222
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,795
How is she?

223
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,888
She's fine but in shock and unconscious.

224
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,932
Umibozu!

225
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,561
A bug?

226
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,849
The bullets just missed your vital organs.

227
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,093
Tell me the truth, Umibozu.

228
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,124
I know you wouldn't shoot an
unarmed person in the back.

229
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,606
It was eight years ago.

230
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,275
Kathleen's father Heywood
and I were teammates.

231
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,715
At that time, a crime organization that
was trying to expand its power

232
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:48,345
contacted us, trying to get us to join
them, but we wouldn't accept.

233
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:55,051
They tried to kill us and in order to do so,
they kidnapped Kathleen,

234
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,695
who was little at the time.

235
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,658
No! Papa!

236
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:05,131
When Heywood found out, he went to
rescue her by himself, without me.

237
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,639
However...

238
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,130
They lay in wait for him, and
he got shot in the back.

239
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,441
When I arrived, it was too late.

240
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,209
I got so mad, I smashed the
organization completely.

241
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,422
But the head of the organization,
Dandy Jack was missing from the scene,

242
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,049
and so was Kathleen.

243
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:31,986
Last night, Kathleen appeared
in front of me as a killer.

244
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,263
Why don't you tell her the truth?!

245
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,365
Even if I tell her, she won't believe me.

246
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,535
If Kathleen shoots me, that's fine with me.

247
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:48,213
Then let me watch her. Did you find out
anything about Dandy Jack

248
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,748
during those couple of days?

249
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,583
He is also in Japan.

250
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,915
He was the one who shot the rocket
launcher into the room.

251
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,615
I will take care of him, then I will
let Kathleen kill me.

252
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,827
Get some rest, Umibozu.

253
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,661
I will kill Falcon. I will.

254
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,737
Oh, you are awake, Ms. Kathleen!

255
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,709
Falcon, where is Falcon?

256
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,309
He got hurt when he rescued you and
now he is resting downstairs.

257
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,855
Kathleen!

258
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,293
He's gone.

259
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,282
What?

260
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:42,196
Just as I thought, you're on his side and
let him escape. Where did he go?!

261
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,531
He is a coward and a chicken!

262
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,504
Calm down, Kathleen!

263
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:53,143
He won't run away. After he finishes his
business, he'll come to see you.

264
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,810
I can't believe he left here in that condition.

265
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:32,180
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

266
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,655
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

267
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:40,386
You skip dinner and eat diet food

268
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:47,525
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

269
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,937
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

270
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,270
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

271
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:02,374
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

272
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:11,453
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

273
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,358
Don't you, don't you know

274
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:19,731
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

275
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:27,570
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

276
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:33,470
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

277
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,019
Mr. Umibozu will lose with wounds like that.

278
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,722
No, he'll be fine. Who we really need
to worry about is Kathleen.

279
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,791
That's right. She went back to Dandy Jack

280
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,326
when she misunderstood you because
you didn't do anything, Ryo!

281
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,095
There's no proof and I can't
do anything about it.

282
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,730
It's not right, letting her go
thinking she was cheated.

283
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,532
The only thing we can do is trust Kathleen.

284
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,966
Whatever, we have to make her realize it.

285
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,436
City Hunter 2:

286
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,337
"Don't Die, Falcon!
Magnum with Love & Revenge (Part 2)"

287
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,436
If you don't watch it, there will be revenge.

288
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,976
Please look forward to the next episode
