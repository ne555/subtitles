1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,796
Maiko Tsugihara, a dancer,

14
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,696
moved into the apartment
building next to ours.

15
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,634
I think someone is trying to get her.

16
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,965
It's you who's trying to get her!

17
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,237
Don't misunderstand me!

18
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,432
She really was attacked by someone
on the street the other night.

19
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,974
Anyway, I have to guard Maiko very closely.

20
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,245
That's why you went to the audition,

21
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,940
to make it easier to get into
the theater, didn't you?

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,716
Well, I failed the audition, but excellent!

23
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,707
I was accepted as a scenery guy.

24
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,847
What part is excellent?

25
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:05,853
Success Story in Shinjuku
The Neighbor is a Beautiful Dancer
(Part 2)

26
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,729
Good, I guess he isn't here today.

27
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,402
Now, I have to hurry before he notices.

28
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,409
It's dangerous if you go out by yourself.

29
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,618
I'm sure it'll be safe before dark.


30
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,456
But I wonder where you're going
this early in the morning?

31
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,818
On a date.

32
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,260
Oh, here you go again.

33
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,362
You're just trying to trick me.

34
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,627
It's true. I'm going to meet
my long-time lover.

35
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:50,532
Well, it's okay. If you're good,
I might introduce you.

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,638
Oh, are you serious?

37
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,573
Dance
Studio

38
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,409
Dance
Studio
Rental Dance Studio? No way!
Your lover means...

39
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,677
Rental Dance Studio? No way!
Your lover means...

40
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:03,445
Exactly, dance is my lover,
now and forever.

41
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,219
Man, I'm relieved to hear that,

42
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,154
but do you need to dance
even on holidays?

43
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,558
Damn, he's with her again.

44
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,492
We can't get close to her until
we make him go away.

45
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,568
Women's Locker Room

46
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,534
Kaori must have given her these things.

47
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,412
I don't know why people misunderstand
me so easily.

48
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,970
I'm such an unlucky guy!

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,456
You ought to lock your locker today.

50
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,557
Why?

51
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,354
An underwear thief might show up.

52
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,187
No way, eww!

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,083
Wow, how vivid she is!

54
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,521
If I told her not to dance, she'd die.

55
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:21,025
Dance is her lover. I might lose against it.

56
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,164
What?

57
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,426
It came from the locker room!

58
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,933
What's the matter?

59
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,434
When I came in to change,

60
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,031
it was already like this and I was
so surprised. Oh, no...

61
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,368
Did you see any strangers?

62
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,670
No, nobody was here when I came in.

63
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,043
Maiko's locker is the one
with the most damage.

64
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,207
The others are probably just for cover.

65
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,056
My underwear is missing!

66
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,956
Oh, no, mine too!

67
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,956
Ah, mine too!

68
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,795
Don't tell me they took my thong!

69
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,457
What are you talking about, yours?
I'm wearing it now!

70
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,859
Oh, I see, you're wearing it now.

71
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,604
Well, it's a consolation among
all these disasters.

72
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,040
I couldn't give up that thong
to somebody else.

73
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,575
This wasn't your doing, was it?

74
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,113
You've got to be kidding.

75
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,911
You know I was captured and
handcuffed at the time!

76
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:22,689
I don't know, because you're incredibly
flexible at times like that.

77
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,088
You don't trust me at all.

78
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,934
Who is that guy? He put something
in my pocket.

79
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,594
These are panties!

80
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,841
This is my stolen underwear.

81
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,141
I knew you were the one that did it!

82
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,310
No, no! A strange guy came up to me
and put it in my pocket!

83
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,488
Maiko, it's a misunderstanding! Wait for me!

84
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,156
Good, now he's separated from her.
Let's go!

85
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,660
Maiko, please let me down!

86
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,832
Not good!

87
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,046
Damn! What a guy! Run!

88
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,487
He's the worst,

89
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,945
but since you're here with me,
you'll protect me, won't you?

90
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,456
I only need one lucky charm.

91
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,085
Oh, boy, but...

92
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,100
Hey, somebody, please let me down!

93
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,000
Toto Theater

94
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,469
Your partner's totally unbelievable!

95
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,331
I'm going to fire that enemy of women!

96
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,912
Well, sometimes, my underwear goes
missing a couple of times a month.

97
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,277
Right? He's a pervert!

98
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,254
But if Ryo really stole the underwear,

99
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,923
he wouldn't make any excuses at all.

100
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,723
What? Are you protecting him,
or accusing him?

101
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:13,096
You were so scared before you met Ryo,
weren't you? How about now?

102
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,935
I don't have time to care about things
like that,

103
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,098
because Mr. Saeba has been doing strange
things to me one after another.

104
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,038
You don't mean...

105
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,378
More than ninety percent of his
perverted character is instinct,

106
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:29,906
but he sometimes plans to divert the
person whom he is guarding.

107
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,884
About the thief in the locker room,

108
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,852
once Ryo said that, I was sure he was right.


109
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,380
He's not a man who makes stupid excuses.

110
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,824
What is that?

111
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,032
Saeba, what did you to the wall of
the woman's locker room?!

112
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,500
A peeping hole.

113
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,801
What the hell?!

114
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,304
I mean, I was trying to repair the wall.

115
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,272
It must have been ruined already.

116
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,071
Aren't those stupid excuses?

117
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,245
I take my statements back.

118
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,173
Toto Theater

119
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,918
Oh, I'm exhausted.

120
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,718
Since it was the last rehearsal,
the director was so intense!

121
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,121
Hey, everybody, it's about time.

122
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,025
Yes, it is. He's pretty punctual.

123
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,468
I bet from the ceiling!

124
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,469
Wall! It must be the wall.

125
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,504
From the floor!

126
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,869
Probably not from the door...

127
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:32,569
Are you ready? 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

128
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,013
Hi, everybody! Are you wearing
your thongs today?

129
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,558
I got it. He came from the floor! I won!

130
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,694
That felt good.

131
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,753
He knew what was going to happen,
but still he came.

132
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,732
Tomorrow is the first day of the show,
so it's special today!

133
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:56,936
Yahoo!

134
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,265
Hi!

135
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,262
Hi!

136
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,998
I brought the male dancers with me today!

137
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,714
We did it, didn't we, Mr. Saeba?

138
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,045
How about that? Are you happy?

139
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,785
Yeah, all my lethargy is gone!

140
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,949
Good! Let's make the show succeed
tomorrow with power like this!

141
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,420
I can't believe what he's thinking!

142
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,222
Tomorrow is the first day of the show,
but I'm not nervous at all.

143
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,635
Yeah, I can't believe that
tomorrow is the day.

144
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,439
I agree. I usually can't sleep the
day before opening night,

145
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,430
but I think I'll be able to sleep
like a baby tonight.

146
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,668
I wonder if it's because of
that man, Mr. Saeba.

147
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,038
I don't think so!

148
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,113
What Ms. Kaori told me might be true.

149
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,553
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,715
Nothing.

151
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,322
That's right. I have a present for you, Maiko.

152
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,063
Here, wishing you a successful
show tomorrow.

153
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,134
Thank you, Mr. Saeba. Just for me?

154
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,067
Well, why don't you open it now?

155
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,275
Sure!

156
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,800
It's just a small expression of my feelings.

157
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,413
Do you like it? A special thong with
Ryo's face printed on it!

158
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,584
What?

159
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,792
Please accept it!

160
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,628
I don't want that thing!

161
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,464
It's okay if you give it back to me
after wearing it once.

162
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,056
Cut it out!

163
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:41,996
Toto Theater

164
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,566
Scenery man! Don't stand around
doing nothing. Hurry up!

165
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,572
The opening of the show is soon.
Hey, there, hurry up!

166
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,079
Hey, Ryo, how long do we need
to keep doing this?

167
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,381
Until we catch the guy who is
trying to get Maiko.

168
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,386
Then when will that be?

169
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,359
Well, I'm sure they're in a hurry.

170
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,694
They will be here soon.

171
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,992
At the earliest, it might be
sometime today.

172
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,192
But I wonder what they want from Maiko?

173
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,177
Please, charm doll.

174
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,747
Please stop my shivering and
shortness of breath.

175
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,146
Please make me relax!

176
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,116
Oh, no, I'm getting more nervous.

177
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,950
Mr. Saeba!

178
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,859
What's the matter?

179
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,363
The curtain will be up soon,
but you're all stressed out.

180
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,900
Yes, I didn't feel anything like this
until yesterday, but...

181
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,402
I realized that unlike everybody else,

182
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,666
this is the first time for me on stage.

183
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,172
Then, suddenly, I felt like this.

184
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:53,512
At the audition, my body stopped
shaking when I held this doll,

185
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,946
but today, it's not working.

186
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,682
The doll is not in a good mood today, is it?

187
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,282
Let me see.

188
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,452
Why are you sulking today, Ms. Doll?

189
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,358
This is...

190
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,590
What? What's wrong, Mr. Saeba? Is
anything wrong with the doll?

191
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,865
Oh, white panties?!

192
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,441
Stop, you mokkori pervert!

193
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,877
Since when are you interested in
the underwear of a doll?!

194
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:34,949
Thank you, Mr. Saeba. I forgot about
being tense because of you.

195
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,462
I heard that if you wear these panties,
you'll relax even more.

196
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,657
Excuse me, but knock it off already.

197
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,231
By the way, where did you find
the white panty doll?

198
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:55,439
Actually, I found this in the closet of
my room the day I moved in.

199
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,511
She was cute, so I brought it with me
the next day when I had an audition,

200
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,146
and I got the part.

201
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,841
Since then, this has been my lucky charm.

202
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,340
It's starting. I have to go.

203
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,013
Good luck!

204
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,414
Thanks!

205
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,895
Now I know what they're after.

206
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:37,249
Bro, why do we have to watch
these girls dance?

207
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,785
We're waiting for our chance.

208
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:43,346
Also, we don't know where she hid it.

209
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,595
Be quiet!

210
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:58,795
I'm sorry!

211
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,467
So that's where she had it.

212
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,712
No wonder we couldn't find it in her room.


213
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,114
Listen, we'll attack her between
the first and second act.

214
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,988
But bro, that guy...

215
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,956
No problem.

216
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,791
I know the stage will be like a battlefield

217
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,993
because of the preparations
for the second act.

218
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,661
That's our best chance.

219
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,525
I see.

220
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,997
Hey, that was great, Maiko!

221
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,231
Thanks!

222
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,477
It's because of this charm
and you, Mr. Saeba.

223
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,844
And especially, because of my talent.

224
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,343
Since you can talk big like that,
you'll be fine in the second act.

225
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,946
Hey, scenery man! Hurry up and
prepare for the second act!

226
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,257
Yes, Sir.

227
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,029
My scene in the second act
will be close to the end,

228
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,519
so I'm going to take a break in the back.

229
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,534
Hey, hey, hurry up! The curtain
will be up soon.

230
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:21,642
You've given us a lot of trouble.
Now return our doll.

231
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,787
I can't believe you were carrying it.

232
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,299
What the hell is this?! This is a fake!

233
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,095
Are you looking for the real one?

234
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,907
I knew you were looking for this,
so I exchanged it just now.

235
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,073
You bastard! Get him!

236
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,678
Jerk!

237
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,918
We did it.

238
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,987
They're finished.

239
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,656
That huge diamond was in that doll?

240
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:43,135
Yeah, remember the diamond theft from that
family's treasure a couple of months ago?

241
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,036
Then those two were the ones that stole it?

242
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:52,776
They put the diamond into the doll and hid it
in the zombie room where no one was living.

243
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:57,644
However, Ms. Maiko rented that room
and found the doll.

244
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:02,721
Then, once we return this
diamond to its owner,

245
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,125
everything should end up fine, but...

246
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,428
After that night, the play continued showing,

247
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,057
but they said it was Ms. Maiko's
responsibility and fired her.

248
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,435
She's extremely mad because she
thinks it's all my fault.

249
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,768
She won't even speak to me
or let me in her room.

250
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,908
You were always peeping instead
of working on the scenery,

251
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,274
so it was really your responsibility
that it broke so easily!

252
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,172
Responsibility, you say, but...

253
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,686
I see, I have an idea. I'm sure she would
be...

254
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,995
No, stop asking. I can't dance any more.

255
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,034
I'm sure that no dance team
would accept a dancer

256
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,161
who caused a big scandal like I did.

257
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,642
Right, I have no choice except to
give up dancing.

258
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,109
I'm going back to my hometown.

259
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,445
Excuse me...

260
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,014
Go home, Saeba!

261
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,922
Excuse me, but my name is Fushimi.
Can I talk to you a second?

262
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,888
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

263
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,856
Of course he wouldn't come in
through the front door.

264
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,367
What?! You want me to join a
dance team in New York?!

265
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,877
Mr. Fushimi, I can't believe it, but are
you the famous music lover,

266
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,846
Mr. Fushimi of the Fushimi Zaibatsu?

267
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,148
I am. I'm impressed you knew me.

268
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,275
Then we can get to the point.

269
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:43,288
What do you think? Can you join
my dance team on Broadway?

270
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:48,123
Are you sure you're not thinking about
someone else, and not me?

271
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:53,965
No, I'm not. I saw your show the other day.
The first act, anyway.

272
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,336
Your dancing needs more polish,

273
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:01,295
but I felt something from you at the show.

274
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,673
I would like to support you
to improve your talent!

275
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,043
I'm afraid that there is no world-class
dancer in Japan.

276
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,718
My dream is to raise the dancers in
Japan to world-class status.

277
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,692
I saw that potential in you.

278
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,786
Please, won't you accept my offer?

279
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,323
No, I mean, I...

280
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,897
Thank you so very much!

281
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,024
What's wrong, Ms. Maiko?

282
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,323
You don't look happy, even though you're
going on your journey to New York.

283
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,796
No, it's not that.

284
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:02,699
I just feel like that I'm dreaming,
with good luck like this.

285
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,838
Are you sure that's all?

286
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,841
Perhaps you're leaving Japan
without telling someone

287
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,571
whom you feel you have to tell about it?

288
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,215
I don't have anybody like that.

289
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,082
But you didn't tell Mr. Saeba, did you?

290
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,379
Who would tell him anything?!

291
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,685
Mr. Fushimi, how do you know Mr. Saeba?

292
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,829
I am the owner of the diamond
which was stolen.

293
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,638
That's right.

294
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,841
Mr. Saeba told me to take care of you

295
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,241
instead of paying him the
reward for the diamond.

296
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,280
Mr. Saeba did?

297
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,718
Then all of this good luck
was planned by him,

298
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:56,119
not because of my talent?

299
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,623
Well...

300
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,464
I'd rather you didn't get the wrong idea.

301
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,467
I'm a good businessman,

302
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,332
and I don't make bad investments.

303
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,072
It was true that I felt something
in you on the stage,

304
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,405
and I think you will be a great
world-class dancer.

305
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:23,341
Before I met him, I was looking
for a dancer like you.

306
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,979
Mr. Saeba just gave me
a chance to meet you.

307
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:34,624
Here, he asked me to give this to you.

308
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,332
Mr. Saeba...

309
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,376
Mr. Saeba,

310
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,314
I promise I'll be a great world-class
dancer and come back to you.

311
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,876
Until then, I will treasure this doll from you.

312
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,451
That doll really was her lucky charm.

313
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:17,235
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

314
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:20,932
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

315
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:26,834
But I couldn't do so

316
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:37,349
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

317
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:43,750
You don't know the reason I'm here

318
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:58,677
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

319
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,044
I wouldn't have let you go

320
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:10,319
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

321
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:16,560
Everyday life is starting

322
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:26,837
In my mind, time has stopped

323
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:33,177
And a double-decker bus is passing

324
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,652
The next job's going to be a huge
commitment!

325
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,988
Guarding a very young king who
is targeted for murder.

326
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,390
If that's all, I can handle it.

327
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,926
His Majesty Nalio is so selfish
and we're driven crazy.

328
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,484
I really want to punish him!

329
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,922
I guess we'll have to do something.

330
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,929
Oh, it's rare that you want to work
for a kid, isn't it?

331
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,828
Because he owns a harem!

332
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,731
Hey, what are you thinking?

333
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,171
City Hunter 2:

334
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,766
"Ryo Educates in a Spartan Way
A Bad Prince Raised in a Harem (Part 1)"

335
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,535
If you miss it, you'll be punished!

336
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,540
Please look forward to the next episode
