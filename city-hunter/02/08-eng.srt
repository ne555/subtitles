Man! Things get tight and we hand out fliers.

Couldn't she come up with
a better idea? Man!

A mokkori babe!

23
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,924
Hi there! Have some coffee with me?

24
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,502
No?

25
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,504
Okay!

26
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,842
Really?!

27
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,200
Hurry, this way!

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,347
What?!

29
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,116
The coffee shop, right? This way!

30
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,612
What an aggressive girl!

31
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:41,816
A Dangerous Detective Before You Know It
Welcome to Tokyo, Father!


32
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,241
My name is Shinkichi Gamao.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

33
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,248
Same here.

34
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,953
Thank you so much for your
kindness to my daughter.

35
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,789
Your daughter? So you two are family?

36
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,166
Oh, my, my.

37
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,270
Machiko, you haven't told me his name yet.

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,499
What?! Oh, yes, his name.

39
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,044
Your name! Your name!

40
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,644
My name?

41
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,977
Of course! Who else could it be?

42
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,574
Ryo Saeba.

43
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,552
Mr. Saeba, you were thirty minutes
late getting here.

44
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:49,459
Father! I told you he was
very busy with work!

45
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,799
He didn't really even have the
time to come here today.

46
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,426
And what is that work?

47
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,835
Your job!

48
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,407
Well, how should I describe it?!

49
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,205
A job that makes the world a brighter place!

50
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,501
You mean, a power company or something?

51
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,380
Power company?!

52
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,909
I'm sorry!

53
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,877
Machiko?

54
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,147
Father, could you excuse us for a bit?


55
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,085
You are my boyfriend.
We are engaged. Got it?


56
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,991
What the heck is going on here?!

57
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,335
Please, all you have to do is play along.

58
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,327
My father's going to be taking the
overnight train back tonight anyway.

59
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,407
I'm not sure what's going on here, but
it appears you're having trouble.

60
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,672
That's right! I'm in big trouble! Please!


61
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,484
I'm not saying I won't help you,

62
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:49,444
but the collateral compensation will be high.

63
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,130
Ryo, what are you doing here when
you're supposed to be working?

64
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,937
Kaori, I was just having a little talk
with this young lady.

65
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,666
Don't waste your breath!

66
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,446
Mr. Saeba!

67
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,984
She tried to hit on me.

68
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,018
Liar!

69
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,286
It's true.

70
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,651
Mr. Saeba!

71
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,855
What?!

72
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,281
Well, that's...

73
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,590
Is this a real revolver?!

74
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,259
What's a power company employee
doing with a gun?

75
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,366
Well, the truth is, I'm a detective.

76
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,738
Detective?

77
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,932
Ryo?

78
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,531
Just play along.

79
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,844
And this is Officer Makimura.

80
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,175
Nice to meet you.

81
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,636
I see, a detective.

82
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,812
A job that makes the world a
brighter place, to be sure.


83
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,422
That's right. I think you better
return that to me.

84
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,098
I'm impressed. And you're so young too.

85
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,998
Oh, it's not all that much.

86
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,874
It's spinning pretty well, today.

87
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,034
Bravo!

88
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,679
Are you really a detective?

89
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,442
Well, something like that.

90
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,211
Mr. Saeba!

91
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,253
Please indulge a father his request.


92
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,948
Certainly!

93
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,258
In my home of Tsugaru to the far north,
spring is yet far away,

94
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,164
the cherry blossoms are only buds.

95
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,801
Machiko's mother, her grandfather,
her grandmother, and close kin

96
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,861
all wait anxiously to hear the
results of my visit here.

97
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:50,376
Until I see with my own eyes the
man who loves Machiko,

98
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:55,281
the man who decided to spend his
whole life with her, I cannot return.

99
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,408
Spend his whole life?! Who...

100
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,921
I won't take much of your time.

101
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,822
Please, I'd like you to show me
your place of work.

102
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,791
My place of work?

103
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,227
A man's place of work is the man.
It's the way he lives.

104
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,963
If I see it, I'll know what kind
of person you are.

105
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,031
Please, grant a father's request!

106
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,401
My place of work... my place
of work would be...

107
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,909
That means, the Metro Police!

108
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,278
Thank you so much!

109
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,690
At your service!

110
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,424
What the?!

111
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,483
Thank you so much!

112
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,021
Ryo, just who is that fellow?!

113
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,989
Questions, questions.

114
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:52,438
Look, Saeko, could you just give the
old gentleman a tour of the building?

115
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,441
You know, you have some kind of
visitors' tour, don't you?

116
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,965
That's true enough.

117
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,812
So, could you give them a quick tour?

118
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,872
I'm sorry. I caught a cold and have a fever.

119
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,652
Looky, looky at all of these IOU's.

120
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,779
The only organized thing about you.

121
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:13,025
Mr. Gamao! My subordinate Ms. Nogami
says she'll show you around!

122
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,061
Hey! Who are you calling your subordinate?!

123
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,519
Calm down, I'm scratching this one out, see?
So thank you!

124
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,191
Ryo!

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,290
Thank you so much.

126
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,460
No, no, don't mention it.

127
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,044
Hello, Metropolitan Police.

128
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,776
Hello, Metropolitan Police.
How can I help you? I see, I see.

129
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:45,923
Shinjuku Hyaku-nin District, a restaurant
bill jumper, first block.

130
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,062
This is the heart of the department.
This is the dispatch center.

131
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,725
It receives 911 calls and then sends
instructions to other stations or patrol cars.

132
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,804
The average response time for our officers
is four minutes and seventeen seconds.

133
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:02,296
Instructions are sent to the patrol car
nearest the scene for rapid response.

134
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,973
Is that stuff about having a boyfriend
a downright lie then?

135
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,150
If I didn't tell them that, they'd
make me come home.

136
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:19,248
Then out of the blue, my father comes to
Tokyo saying he wants to meet my boyfriend.

137
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,250
And that's why you dragged me into it.

138
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,159
Please, I'll pay you. Just continue the act.

139
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:30,703
I like Tokyo. I love my job in fashion design.


140
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,105
And I want to see if I have
what it takes in Tokyo.

141
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,039
Please, Mr. Saeba!

142
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,642
I see.

143
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,846
Yet another youth who falls in love with
the big city and leaves home.

144
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,509
What can I say? I accept your offer then.

145
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,578
It would be great if I became
your real boyfriend.

146
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,484
My head hurts.

147
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,925
To all units! Homicide reported in
the Suginami District!

148
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,196
Detective, what's happening?!

149
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:02,133
Oh, that red lamp is the signal for
serious crimes like robbery or murder.

150
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,393
In other words, the fewer of those you see,
the more peaceful things are.

151
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,297
I see, serious crimes.

152
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,578
That one! And that one there!

153
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,846
A robbery has been reported in Takaido.

154
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,247
Bomb threat in Shinjuku.

155
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:15,948
A murder in Marunouchi.
Bomb threat in Shinjuku.

156
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,415
A murder in Marunouchi.

157
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,882
A bus has been hijacked in Kodaira.

158
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,551
My, my, my...

159
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,017
Tokyo certainly is a dangerous place.

160
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,847
My goodness.

161
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,998
Yahoo!

162
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,670
Ryo! Are you sure it's okay
to take a patrol car?!

163
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:39,905
Fine, fine.

164
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,137
Mr. Gamao, since you're here and all,
why don't we take a tour of Tokyo?

165
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,480
Are you sure it's okay to do that?

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,484
Sure, I was careful to let Detective
Nogami know about our plans.

167
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,385
Dear Saeko,
I borrowed a patrol car.
Ryo

168
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,215
What's this?! He borrowed
a patrol car, he says?!

169
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,262
It's going to take more than one or two
freebies for this one, Ryo!

170
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,442
Hello, how are you doing?

171
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,215
I am Detective Saeba of the
Metropolitan Police.

172
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,705
I commend you for your hard work.

173
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,650
Yes, Sir!

174
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,520
See you.

175
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,258
Per...

176
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,725
...vert!

177
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,367
Mr. Tokyo Detective, Sir, do you always
touch the lady officers' behinds like that?

178
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,929
That's right. It's normal departmental
greeting procedure.

179
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,771
Idiot! What if he takes you seriously?!

180
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,218
Mr. Gamao, that's Tokyo Tower.

181
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,156
I knew that. I've often seen it on TV.

182
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,124
Mr. Gamao, that's Asakusa's Kaminari Gate.


183
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,194
I'm sure you've seen it in
the Tora-san movies.

184
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,156
Is that the Shibamata Buddhist temple?

185
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,562
Mr. Gamao, that's the Ryogoku National
Sports Complex.

186
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,940
Wow! That's Konishiki!

187
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,032
My goodness!

188
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,206
Next stop, Sunshine 60!

189
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,048
Mr. Saeba, thank you for the tour of Tokyo,

190
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,642
but I'd rather see you at your
normal, everyday routine.

191
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,708
Your normal routine, please.

192
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,255
Normal routine?

193
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,382
Very well then!

194
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,293
Let's go for a date in my patrol car!

195
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,291
It's just me, Ryo. Why are you running?

196
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,528
The gravitational force from your lips
is drawing me closer!

197
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,775
That's a bit too routine!

198
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,242
Sorry.

199
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,349
And this is the expressway, Mr. Gamao.

200
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,456
I told you to stay off the expressway.

201
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,816
What is it, Father?

202
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,063
Mr. Saeba, can you find a bathroom?

203
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,699
A bathroom?!

204
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,725
Very well, I know what to do.

205
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,573
Patrol car to your left!
Please keep to the right!

206
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,780
This is so exciting!

207
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,484
Glad to hear it!

208
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,402
Mr. Saeba, would you be interested
in coming to Tsugaru?

209
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,003
To Tsugaru?

210
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,640
I've been friends with the police chief
back home since we were kids.

211
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,541
Perhaps we can arrange to have
you transferred to Tsugaru.

212
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,077
No, thank you. I like this town.

213
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:14,420
I don't understand how you can say you like
a place with so many people and cars.

214
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,081
All those people is what makes it nice.


215
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,553
So many different people,
so many different lives.

216
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,057
I like feeling all of that human energy.

217
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,396
I guess nature is what I love about Tsugaru.


218
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,301
I guess that's how it is.

219
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,908
Please, Mr. Gamao, feel free to help yourself!

220
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,053
Look here, Ryo! Can you really
afford all of this?

221
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,216
No problem! It's going on the
department's tab anyway.

222
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,398
Machiko, this morning, I dropped by
the boutique where you work.

223
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,566
Father!

224
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,303
I requested that they allow you to
quit at the end of the month.

225
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,134
How could you do such a thing?

226
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:11,277
A young lady of marriageable age should
tend to her domestic training.

227
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,212
You can come back to Tokyo
after you're married.

228
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,338
Why?!

229
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,813
Why do you have to fuss over me so?
Just leave me alone!

230
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,515
Machiko...

231
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,921
Just go home to Tsugaru!
That's your favorite place, isn't it?

232
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,793
So why don't you just stay in Tsugaru?!

233
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:32,093
You're such a country bumpkin
it makes me ashamed!

234
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,026
If my friends see you, I'll be a
laughingstock. Go home!

235
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,967
I'm sorry, there was a mosquito
on your cheek.

236
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,413
Mr. Saeba...

237
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,525
All available units!

238
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,595
Bank robbery in progress at Shisei Bank,
Oote branch! Repeat...

239
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,333
Bank robbery? This world is
one scary place all right.

240
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,029
Mr. Saeba, don't they need your help?

241
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,100
Oh, no! I'm sure somebody will get there.


242
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,710
That won't do at all! Please don't
concern yourself about us.

243
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,838
That's not it.

244
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,243
Mr. Saeba! A man is his work!

245
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,974
Yes, Sir!

246
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,889
Look at them go to work!

247
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,930
I leave these two in your hands,
Officer Makimura!

248
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,732
Yes, Sir! I wish you success, Sir!

249
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,305
It's useless to resist!
Just give up and come out!

250
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:54,239
Shut up! You let us out now,
or this lady could get hurt!

251
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,638
What next?

252
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,510
Right now we wait for backup.

253
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,175
That won't be necessary.

254
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,824
I'm Detective Saeba and I've come on
orders of the Commissioner.

255
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,519
I'll take over.

256
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,358
Orders of the Commissioner?

257
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,130
For your own safety, move your men outside.


258
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,899
Understood.

259
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,426
All right, men! Let's go!

260
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,667
That's right, everyone out.

261
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,240
Who the hell are you?!

262
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,314
I'm Detective Saeba of the Metro Police.

263
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,740
I can't stand guys who make pretty girls cry.


264
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,451
What the hell?!

265
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,033
I'm Detective Ryo Saeba.

266
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,399
Please direct your call thanking me
to Detective Nogami.

267
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,362
But if it's a date you'd like, I'd be happy
to talk about that right now!


268
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,509
No, thank you.

269
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,179
This is no time to hit on a girl!

270
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,669
Goodbye, Detective.

271
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,281
What?!

272
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,848
All right, everybody stay cool!

273
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,487
He had a partner!

274
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,357
Hey! Mr. Detective! Throw down
that monster gun!

275
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,692
Saeba!

276
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,635
All right.

277
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,002
All right, none of you move.

278
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,348
Brother...

279
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,215
Idiot! What are you waiting for?!
We're getting outta here.

280
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,520
We're keeping this one hostage
till we get to a safe place.

281
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,981
Who the hell are you?!

282
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,330
I'll be your hostage. Just let go of that girl!

283
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,797
What the?!

284
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,632
Father!

285
00:18:55,601 --> 00:19:00,402
That girl is my life! If you hurt her,
you'll answer to me!

286
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,771
Don't worry, Machiko.
I'm going to protect you.

287
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,603
Father...

288
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,383
You old fart!

289
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,941
Don't do that.

290
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,922
I'll be your hostage. Let the old man go.


291
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,626
You?! You mean it?!

292
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,854
What the?!


293
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,898
How thrilling! I'm all tingly!

294
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,166
Really?

295
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,100
You numbskull! What are ya doing?!

296
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,837
What?!

297
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,184
Men all remind me of a certain someone.

298
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,192
I wonder who?

299
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,860
YOU! Who else?!

300
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,526
I should have known.

301
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,469
Father, father...

302
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,433
I know, it was frightening,
but it's okay now.

303
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,281
Father, father...

304
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,646
Now, now.

305
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,283
A father's love is wonderful.
I'd like to be a father myself.

306
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,524
Father!

307
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,584
Father!

308
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:39,737
Ueno, Ueno. The express train bound
for Aomori will depart soon.

309
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:44,701
Mr. Saeba, our time has been short,
but I want to thank you for everything.

310
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,540
I'm so happy Machiko has a
friend like you, Mr. Saeba.

311
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,609
I'm not sure I know what to say.

312
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:59,458
If you don't mind, please look out for
Machiko until she gets a real boyfriend.

313
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,692
A real boyfriend?

314
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,455
So, you knew?

315
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,730
I'm that girl's father.

316
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,722
I can tell when she's lying just by
looking at her face.

317
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,036
Father, some tea and a box lunch for you.

318
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,162
Thank you.

319
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,808
Machiko, it's your life.

320
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,679
Live it the way you want to
so you have no regrets.

321
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,146
Father...

322
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,823
Machiko, take care of good care of yourself!

323
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,054
Father, please send my love to Mom,
Grandpa and Grandma!

324
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,233
Machiko!

325
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,805
Father!

326
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,011
Thank you, Father.

327
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,549
Her father...

328
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:02,851
Well then, time to honor her father's wishes
by keeping a mokkori eye on Machiko.

329
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,591
No, I already have a job for you to do.

330
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:07,726
A job?

331
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,159
Here you go.

332
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,098
Your punishment for loafing today is
to hand out ALL of them!

333
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,226
No, no, Kaori.

334
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:32,648
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

It's not fair! I got duped into
buying a fake coat!

347
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,322
And you're just awful, Ryo!

348
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,991
Staying out late on a date when

White bike?

if you know someone like that!
