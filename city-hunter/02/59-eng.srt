1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,563
Even though he's a little kid, he's the king.

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,961
Prince Nalio has been targeted
by his own uncle.

15
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:48,708
Whatever! He took a bath with Saeko,
and treated me as his servant,

16
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,479
and on top of that, he owns a
harem in his own country.

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,947
I'll never, ever accept a job offer
for a kid like him!

18
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,140
Oh, boy, you are so childish.

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,953
Wait a sec. Harem?

20
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,987
What's the matter, Ryo?

21
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,655
All right! I accept this job.

22
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:08,719
I'll raise Nalio in the school for men
to be an independent man.

23
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:14,099
Ryo Educates in a Spartan Way
A Bad Prince Raised in a Harem
(Part 2)

24
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,179
How persistent they are.
I'm pretty impressed.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,152
I'm not going to the school! I'm going
to go back. Stop the car!

26
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,892
Hey, I told you to fasten
the seatbelt properly.

27
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,560
No way. I hate it being so tight.

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,187
Then I don't care what happens to you.

29
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,128
What did you do to me?!

30
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,464
You didn't listen to what I said. Hold on tight.

31
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,126
That's dangerous! What are you
going to do if I get hurt?!

32
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,151
That's why I told you to hold on tight!

33
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,034
He's going to be executed
when I get back, really.

34
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,256
Get out of my way! You're blocking
the passing lane!

35
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,224
I can't believe how rude
Japanese drivers are!

36
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,736
What? You missed them? You idiot!

37
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,170
Never mind. Wait for further instructions.

38
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:04,244
Schmidt, it looks like the women
you hired were useless.

39
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,079
I hope you can take care of the matter.

40
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,547
Please don't worry.

41
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,417
According to the information I have, the man
named Saeba is a superior sweeper,

42
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,351
but is absolutely hopeless when
women are involved.

43
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,390
I see. I guess he's off-guard
when he is with women.

44
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,158
Well, anyway, I'll leave it in your hands.

45
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,251
Please leave it to me, Lord Baccalo.

46
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,129
When I succeed, please do not forget

47
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,120
about the position of the chief
of the Intelligence Agency.

48
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,031
I'll give you anything as a reward.

49
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,598
Now, we walk.

50
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,112
Walk? Walk where?

51
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,114
The school is deep inside of this forest.

52
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,275
No, I don't want to walk.

53
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,974
Then suit yourself.

54
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,921
I won't go.

55
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,751
What?


56
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,616
I thought you didn't want to walk.

57
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,052
That's why I ran, instead of walking.

58
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,917
Wow, what a funny joke!

59
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,458
What? You may be the king, but
you're such a chicken.

60
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,522
I just slipped.

61
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,672
I can't walk any further.
Carry me on your back.

62
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,912
What did you just say?

63
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:49,182
I am the king. What's wrong with saying
to carry me on your back?

64
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,550
What are you going to do if I say no?

65
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,551
The guillotine.

66
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,019
Sounds like fun. Here, go for it.

67
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,011
That's it!

68
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,459
Damn!

69
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,724
If you can do that much, you can walk.
Now, let's go!

70
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,679
Okay, we're here.

71
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,681
Where is the school?

72
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,308
It's in front of you.

73
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,898
What is this place?

74
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,033
This is the school for men.

75
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,070
At this place, it doesn't matter
if you are a king or a kid.

76
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,738
Adults do things that adults can do,

77
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,175
and kids do things which kids can do
and cooperate with each other.


78
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,406
This is the place to learn how
we can live together.

79
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,671
Understand?

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,381
Not at all.

81
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,178
Well, you will see.

82
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,184
Hey, I'm hungry.

83
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,190
Cleaning comes first.

84
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,825
You sweep the floor.

85
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,360
Why do I have to clean?

86
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,225
Listen! If you want to eat, do it.

87
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,506
I'll remember this, jerk!

88
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,030
Next, bedding.

89
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,142
Who does he think he is?!

90
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,541
What? What is this?

91
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,810
Oh, hey, that's not for children.

92
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,257
Why? There are many naked
women in my harem.

93
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,526
Naked breasts! Many...

94
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,020
Heaven!

95
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,792
What's the matter?

96
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,737
Oh, well, you're just a kid and you are
surrounded by naked women!

97
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,034
It's unhealthy!

98
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,434
Unhealthy?

99
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,070
Oh, I'm so tired.

100
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,942
I'm finished. Let me eat something.

101
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,755
You eat what you catch.

102
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,723
I've never fished before.

103
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:16,357
If you haven't done it before,
you'll learn now. Follow me.

104
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,474
Wow, what a great fishing day today!
This is the fifth one.

105
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,851
What the hell? You haven't caught any?

106
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,622
You suck. Do you want one of mine?

107
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,614
Shut up! I don't want any charity from you!

108
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,722
Wow! Got one!

109
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,863
Need a hand?

110
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,466
Don't touch it! I caught it, so I'll land it!

111
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,400
All right, that's the spirit! Go for it!

112
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,532
I did it, I did it! Mine is a lot
bigger than Saeba's.


113
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,909
It's too early to be so happy.

114
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,638
We can't eat until we start the fire.

115
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,437
Start the fire?

116
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,014
What are you doing? You can't eat
your fish if you just stand there!

117
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,721
Is that all?

118
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,622
I'll just grab this big branch rather
than a bunch of little ones.

119
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,590
That's the easy way.

120
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:43,082
You can't use green wood like that.
It's got to be dry.

121
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,745
And in order to start the fire, you
need tinder and kindling.

122
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,221
You're mean.

123
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,924
You could have taught me that at
the beginning, couldn't you?

124
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,726
Did you want me to teach you?

125
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,355
Then you should have asked
me to teach you.

126
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,947
Is it good?

127
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,380
Which do you think is better, ice cream
in the city or this meal?

128
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,686
I really suffered for this thing.

129
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,654
Of course it tastes better!

130
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,250
You're starting to understand, little by little.

131
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,938
What are you doing?

132
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,579
We can't predict when they
will come and attack us,

133
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,342
so I'm making some traps.

134
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,838
Please teach me.

135
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,117
About what?

136
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,687
I want to help you, so please
teach me how to use a knife.

137
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,790
Sure, I will. Here, hold this.

138
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,061
By the way, Nalio, about your harem...

139
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,535
What do all the naked women do for you?

140
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,936
They wash my body in the bath,
or sleep with me.


141
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,235
What the hell?! Bathe or
even sleep together?!

142
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,046
I can't wait to get paid!

143
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,035
What?

144
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,644
This knife isn't cutting.

145
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,785
You're holding it backwards.

146
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,275
Oh, I see.

147
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,588
You're right! It's cutting!

148
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,974
Ms. Saeko, it's been three weeks.
Is Prince Nalio really okay?

149
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,101
If something had happened, I'm sure
he would have contacted us.

150
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,906
Here's the message from Ryo.

151
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,615
What does it say? Did anything
happen to Prince Nalio?

152
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,554
I want to do mokkori!
Please bring many girls!

153
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,191
What the hell is he thinking?!

154
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,698
How about Prince Nalio?
How is Prince Nalio doing?

155
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,839
It doesn't say. He just wants us to
bring a change of clothes.

156
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,238
Surely not...

157
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:26,072
Bring many girls? It's from Ryo, all right.


158
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,017
Please take me to the place where
Prince Nalio is. Please!

159
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,121
Mr. Gliss, for now, ask Kaori
to take care of things

160
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,748
and she will find out what they're doing.

161
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,522
But...

162
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,126
Please relax.

163
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,424
If Ryo makes Prince Nalio
do something stupid,

164
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,724
I'll beat the stuffing out of Ryo
with my hammer!

165
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,668
Ms. Kaori!

166
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,944
Mr. Gliss, I understand how much
you worry about him,

167
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,812
but isn't that the reason why Prince Nalio
was raised like that?

168
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,006
Yes, indeed.

169
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,185
And also, there is another reason
why Ryo sent the letter.

170
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,720
What? You mean that letter?

171
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,522
A woman has just left the apartment.

172
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,698
Don't hesitate this time. Finish it at once.

173
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,600
Finally made a move, did they?
I was getting bored.

174
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:35,575
How about seeing the moment
of a new king being born?

175
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,406
I see. It might be interesting.

176
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,818
I'm finally here.

177
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,523
What? Nobody's here.

178
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,990
That noise...

179
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,936
Good, Nalio. That's about right.
Come up here.

180
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,941
What are you doing here?

181
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:14,375
Oh, you came, Kaori. By the way,
where are the girls? Girls?

182
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,746
Of course I didn't bring any!

183
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:21,188
Anyway, what are you thinking,
making the king dig a hole?!

184
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,764
Oh, boy. You got so dirty. You'll be
fine since I'm here now.

185
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,300
It's okay. This is part of my job here.

186
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,767
What? Job?

187
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,605
Anyway, you need to clean yourself up.

188
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,402
Now, let's go back to the cabin.

189
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,004
Stop! A poisonous snake!

190
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,640
Oh, it's just some ivy.

191
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,714
That's right. There are no poisonous
snakes around here.

192
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,753
Oh, I see.

193
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,391
What are you thinking to let a kid
carry that dangerous thing?!

194
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,867
To fight.

195
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,203
No way! Are you going to let him
fight against the assassin?

196
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,137
Exactly.

197
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,673
Exactly? Don't talk as if it's nothing!

198
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,733
How much do you think a little kid
like him can do?!

199
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,379
Nalio, are you going to run away
if the enemy comes here?

200
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,881
No way. I'm gonna fight as a man.

201
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:19,218
No, I don't know what this
pervert told you, but...

202
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,986
Hey! Who's this pervert you
are talking about!?

203
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,255
You lost your sixth sense because
you've been here

204
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,723
for three weeks without any
girls, haven't you?!

205
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,858
Don't make me remember about girls!

206
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,797
You two, it's not a good idea
to fight internally,

207
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,958
since we are about to fight our enemies.

208
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,836
Look, Nalio is calmer than you are.

209
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,538
About to fight...


210
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,472
But the enemy isn't here!

211
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,599
Saeba told me that you brought them.

212
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,639
What? Me?

213
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,915
Nalio, are you ready?

214
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,251
Yes!

215
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,018
They're gone? Impossible!

216
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,785
That's it. A bolthole!

217
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,205
Mokkori breasts!

218
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,310
Jerk!

219
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,525
Nalio!

220
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,492
Hi!

221
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,826
Oh, no! Help me! Let me down!

222
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,932
We did it!

223
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,427
Mokkori butt!

224
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,332
Pervert!

225
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:26,879
I can't stand it!

226
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,880
Right, two down!
I can't stand it!

227
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,574
Right, two down!



228
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,176
I hate caterpillars!

229
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,590
Oh, no! Help me!

230
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,292
Somebody, get them off me!

231
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,384
Not good! Take your clothes off!

232
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,929
Hurry up!

233
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,692
What? Who?

234
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,123
See you later, mokkori bra cutie!

235
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,203
Oh, no! What are you doing?!

236
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,500
Three down!

237
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,781
Oh, what a good boy! You already gave up
on running away from us?

238
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,874
What color are your panties, lady?

239
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,420
You have to get punished if you
make fun of adults!

240
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,012
It's pink with print on the back.

241
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,012
I got you, didn't I?

242
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,122
Jerk!

243
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,817
What the hell?!

244
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,630
What are you doing?!

245
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,298
Please put me down!

246
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,566
Please put me down!
Told you they were pink with
print on the back, right?

247
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,135
Oh, no, I'm so embarrassed!
Please forgive me!
Told you they were pink with
print on the back, right?

248
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,303
Oh, no, I'm so embarrassed!
Please forgive me!
It really is! Incredible!

249
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,292
It really is! Incredible!

250
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,473
Have you done that before?

251
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,304
No, even I haven't gone quite that far.

252
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,034
If you try anything funny, this
woman will die instantly.

253
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,214
Ryo, I'm so sorry.

254
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,114
Long time no see, Nalio.

255
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,081
Uncle!

256
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:43,689
It's a hundred years too early for a
little kid like you to be the King.

257
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,858
I don't like killing people without any profit.

258
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,527
Why don't you turn over the throne to me,

259
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,596
so that I can spare your life?

260
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,763
I refuse!

261
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,232
I can't turn over the throne to a person

262
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,900
who would use the country as
his personal belongings.

263
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,835
What the hell?! Don't you care what
happens to this woman?!

264
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,037
She has nothing to do with this matter.
If you want to kill someone, kill me!

265
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,165
How courageous! Come here!

266
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,711
I don't think so.

267
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,147
Let it go!

268
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,846
You die first!

269
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,085
There!

270
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,792
This is heavy! Help me!

271
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,701
We did it, Nalio!

272
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,668
Yeah!

273
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,233
Prince Nalio!

274
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,374
Prince Nalio! I'm glad you're unhurt...


275
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,569
Gliss, sorry to have made you worry.

276
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,479
Gliss, why are you crying?

277
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,251
You've done so well. I'm so happy
to see you like this.

278
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,412
I owe everything to Saeba.

279
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,225
Well, I admit Ryo is strong,

280
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,561
but I also wish he wasn't a mokkori pervert.

281
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,619
Hey, hey!


282
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,462
Saeko, sorry to ask you, but
can you arrest them?

283
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,794
Sure, Prince Nalio. I will take care of them.

284
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,199
How did this happen?

285
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,413
Ms. Saeko, Ms. Kaori, thank you
for everything.

286
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,215
Prince Nalio, please take care.

287
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
Take care.

288
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,808
Okay, and you guys take care too.

289
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,551
By the way, where is Saeba? He told me
he would go with me.

290
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,817
I heard him say he was going
shopping a little while ago.

291
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,289
There he is.

292
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,828
Too heavy...

293
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,464
What is that baggage?

294
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,035
Well, it was hard to buy all these drinks.

295
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,630
I've heard that there are no mokkori
drinks over there at all.

296
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,404
Oh, boy...

297
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,645
Hey, old man, since I bought
this many drinks,

298
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,014
please select the girls from the harem.

299
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,916
What? Oh, I haven't told you, have I?

300
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,152
What?

301
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,823
Prince Nalio has canceled the
engagement with Ms. Saeko,

302
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,882
and abolished the harem.

303
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,088
Then, what about my pay?

304
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,498
Sure, instead of the harem,

305
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,557
you can enjoy sightseeing in our
country as much as you want.

306
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,126
No way!

307
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,804
I worked so hard because of the harem pay.

308
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:21,346
Saeba, just as you told me, it's not healthy to
have a harem for a child like me.

309
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,181
I fully understand.

310
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,716
In order to make me understand that,

311
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:29,585
you taught me how shameful mokkori was by
using those female assassins, right?

312
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,684
I want to show my appreciation.
Come to my country with me.

313
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,449
No, I don't want to go!

314
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,130
I won't go to a country without any mokkori!

315
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,597
Let me go already!

316
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,511
Nalio, next time you come to Japan,

317
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,979
I won't help you at all even if
you are in danger!

318
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,883
See? I knew he was going to jump out.

319
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,185
It's just like the last time this happened.

320
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,055
He must really hate to go to a
country without mokkori.

321
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,625
Well, it's the source of Ryo's power to work.

322
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,092
Really...

323
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,502
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

324
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,199
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

325
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,101
But I couldn't do so

326
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:37,617
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

327
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:44,017
You don't know the reason I'm here

328
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:58,944
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

329
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,311
I wouldn't have let you go

330
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:10,586
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

331
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:16,827
Everyday life is starting

332
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:27,104
In my mind, time has stopped

333
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,444
And a double-decker bus is passing

334
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,186
Ms. Naomi is a magician.

335
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,723
She's going to succeed to the name
of the late Tenho the Second.

336
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,893
Right before the ceremony, her rival
is trying to get her?

337
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,494
Well, leave the matter to me!

338
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,997
But she has a fear of men,

339
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,299
so Ryo, you're not invited.

340
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,029
I don't think I can give up a
mokkori client like her!

341
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,503
Oh, boy, not again.

342
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,871
City Hunter 2:

343
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:03,208
"Love is Magic -
Ms. Magician With a Male Phobia"

344
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,039
If you miss it, I'm going to give you a
hammer!

345
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,043
Please look forward to the next episode
