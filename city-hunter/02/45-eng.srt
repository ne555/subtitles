1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,632
I'm sorry, Brother, I haven't been
able to come here often.

14
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,630
It's been about two years now, hasn't it?

15
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:55,006
Someone has kept me very busy, so I
haven't had time to find a lover.

16
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,517
If I'm still single next time I come here,

17
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:01,453
it would be a good idea if someone
would take responsibility for me.

18
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:07,327
Damn! He's not serious even when
visiting the grave of his best friend!

19
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:11,998
If you see him trying to chase women,
please curse him and kill him!

20
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:16,958
Nineteen Year-Old Widow!
Lover in the Heart of a Beautiful Sketch Artist
(Part 1)

21
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,742
What a beauty!

22
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,714
I can't believe I'm seeing
such a beautiful lady

23
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,376
who matches the solemnity of
the graveyard so perfectly!

24
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,479
I'm sure that it's God's plan
for me to meet her!

25
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,325
You!

26
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,961
What a coincidence, Mrs. Serizawa!

27
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,020
You're visiting your late husband's
grave alone, aren't you?

28
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,432
Good timing!

29
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:51,529
My boss wants to talk to you so why
don't you come with us?

30
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,100
There is nothing to talk about. Goodbye.

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,279
No, you can't leave. I was told to take
you by force if necessary.

32
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,413
Let me go.

33
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,415
Now, let me guide you to our car.

34
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,211
Somebody help!

35
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,676
Hey! You thugs, don't pick up
women at the graveyard!

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,025
Are you all right, Miss?

37
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,359
Yes...

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,697
That's good. Well, Miss, it must be
fate to meet you like this.

39
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,898
Let's have some tea or something.

40
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,299
Well...
Let's have some tea or something.

41
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:19,731
Well...

42
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,561
Jerk! Who's trying to pick up women?!

43
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,140
Pick up? You're rude. I'm holding a
service for my late friend.

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,075
I won't forgive anyone who disturbs
this hallowed activity.

45
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,445
Jerk!

46
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,973
You'll pay for this!

47
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,484
I guess guys like them always
say the same thing.

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,226
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,460
My pleasure.

50
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,028
Is this your family grave?

51
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,330
Yes!

52
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,768
Daisuke Serizawa, died in 1988,
fifty-nine years old.

53
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,271
Is this your father?

54
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,000
No, my husband.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,843
Husband?

56
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,478
Fifty-nine years old?

57
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,482
You look very young, but maybe
you're fifty or something?

58
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,915
I'm nineteen years old.

59
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,643
When I met him, I was a high school student.

60
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:20,057
From the moment we met,
we fell deeply in love.

61
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,196
Even now, when I remember the time
I met him, I still get excited.

62
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:23,830
I see.

63
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,062
Six months later, we got married even
though everyone was against it.

64
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,903
But...

65
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,573
He'd had a heart problem for a long time,

66
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,633
and right after the wedding ceremony,
he had a heart attack.

67
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,380
The day that should have been
our wedding anniversary,

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,211
became the anniversary of his death.

69
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,519
This young, and she is already a widow.

70
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,044
On top of that, she became a widow
right after the wedding.

71
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,387
She might still be a virgin?!

72
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,595
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned
things like that.

73
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,096
Don't worry about it.

74
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,690
I haven't introduced myself yet.
My name is Ryo Saeba.

75
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,866
I am Ayako Serizawa.

76
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,670
Ms. Ayako,

77
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,807
do you have any idea who those guys
were? I might be able to help you.

78
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,142
But...

79
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,678
Is it possible that someone
is trying to get you?

80
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,168
Ah! Watch out!

81
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,915
You womanizer!

82
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,418
Did you forget that you came here
to visit my brother's grave?!

83
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,819
Can you say you were his best friend?!

84
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,754
Wait! This is a misunderstanding!

85
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,223
This is a part of my service
for the late Makimura!

86
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,793
Excuse me...
What are you talking about?! Shame on you!

87
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,560
Hey, stop, Kaori!
What are you talking about?! Shame on you!

88
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,794
Hey, stop, Kaori!

89
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,988
Madame Serizawa!

90
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,364
Mr. Masaichi?

91
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,533
Both of you, what are you
doing to my mistress!

92
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,502
I see. You're a spy from Ootone, aren't you?

93
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,438
Wait, Mr. Masaichi!

94
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,106
Wait, Mr. Masaichi!
Don't even think about trying to hide!

95
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,475
No, they're not. These two are...
I'll make it so that you can't do
anything like that, ever!

96
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,844
Mr. Masaichi! No!

97
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,675
Mr. Masaichi! Stop!

98
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,120
Don't misunderstand, Mr. Masaichi.

99
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,113
These people rescued me from
the Ootone guys.

100
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,490
I saw Ootone's car, so I thought...

101
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,532
I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,932
I did something stupid. I tried to hurt
the person who saved Madame!

103
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,465
As an apology, I will cut
my little finger off.

104
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,042
Stop, Mr. Masaichi! Mr. Saburo,
please stop him!

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,981
Please stop, brother.

106
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,784
Let me go! Let me be a man!

107
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:24,984
This is by Madame's order! I can't let you go!

108
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,753
What are those people?
This is by Madame's order! I can't let you go!

109
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,053
I have no idea.
This is by Madame's order! I can't let you go!

110
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:27,781
I have no idea.

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,630
Hey, calling her Madame, cutting a
finger off, this foreign car...

112
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,965
It can't be anything other than...

113
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,695
I guess so. The next word to appear
should be...

114
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,860
Kanto
Kichijo
Gumi

115
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,013
Welcome home, Madame!

116
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,748
Just as I thought.

117
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,343
Well, it means, Ayako's late husband was...


118
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:06,022
The fourth leader of the Kantou Kichijo
Gumi, Daisuke Serizawa?

119
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,228
This middle aged man with
scary facial features,

120
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,732
fell in love with a high school girl!

121
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,495
How vexing!

122
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,308
Please have some tea.

123
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,037
Please make yourself at home.

124
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,042
Thank you so very much.

125
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,087
Sir, please allow me to ask you a question.

126
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,961
You said your name was Ryo Saeba,

127
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,165
perhaps you are the person
called City Hunter?

128
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,733
Ping-pong!

129
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,200
Just as I thought.

130
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,237
City Hunter?

131
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,469
Madame, we must have been
guided by our late boss.

132
00:07:56,175 --> 00:08:00,646
Mr. Saeba, would you please
help us, the Kichijo Gumi?

133
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,113
Mr. Masaichi?

134
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,486
Daisuke Serizawa...

135
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,387
When I saw that name at the graveyard,

136
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,287
I should have remembered instantly.

137
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,593
Serizawa was the biggest boss in this area,

138
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,754
and he was called the last traditional yakuza.

139
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,831
Last year, when the boss passed away,

140
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,901
his associate, Ootone, established his
own group, the ltsukaichi Kai,

141
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,403
and they're trying to take over the
territory of the Kichijo Gumi.

142
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,961
I heard a rumor about that.

143
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,008
The guys we saw at the graveyard
approached Ms. Ayako

144
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,777
in order to get the Territorial Title certificate.

145
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:36,908
Yes, and that wasn't the first time that
Madame has been in danger.

146
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,244
Please protect Madame from the jerks of
the ltsukaichi Kai. Please!

147
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,888
Mr. Masaichi, don't say something
ridiculous like that.

148
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,797
I don't know anything about Mr. Saeba,
and this is our own problem.

149
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,133
We shouldn't get other people
involved in our problems.

150
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,835
But, Madame...

151
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,437
Ryo, you're not going to take
this job, are you?

152
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,007
Yakuza-related work is usually
very troublesome.

153
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,608
What?!

154
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,135
Don't mistake the Kichijo Gumi for
those other violent groups!

155
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,016
I've done a horrible thing to the
person who saved Madame!

156
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,677
As an apology, I will cut my finger off,
so please forgive me!

157
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,123
Someone stop Mr. Masaichi!

158
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,624
What's the matter, Madame?

159
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,091
What's the matter?

160
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,061
Let me go, Ginnoji!

161
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:22,495
No, don't let him go.

162
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,496
My apology is my finger! Let me go!
No, don't let him go.

163
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,521
My apology is my finger! Let me go!

164
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,333
What are you going to do?

165
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,632
I have a feeling that I might
not be able to refuse.

166
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,340
I'm opposed to accepting this request.

167
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:41,245
I think you want to do it because Ms. Ayako
is beautiful, but I don't like the idea.

168
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:47,420
If you care about her, why don't you
help her get out of the yakuza world?

169
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,853
Don't you think so?

170
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,783
Don't ignore me! Say something!

171
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,733
How long have you been there?
Where is Ryo?

172
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,837
I don't know. I was told by Mr. Saeba
to sit here quietly.

173
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,806
He's such a jerk, fooling around like this.

174
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,209
Where did Ms. Ayako go?!

175
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,644
Where is she now?

176
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,202
At this time, I guess Madame is probably...

177
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,054
Just as I thought. Ms. Ayako is in danger!

178
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,544
Where is the bathroom?

179
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,725
Hey, Ginnoji, what's the matter?

180
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,492
Masaichi...

181
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,794
Mr. Masaichi, Ms. Ayako is in danger!

182
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,262
Something's happening to Madame?

183
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,230
We have to hurry and stop Ryo!

184
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,969
What is this?

185
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,672
It's a trap to catch immoral people who try to
peek at Madame when she's taking a bath.

186
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,546
For a year, there hasn't been
anyone who tried it.

187
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,882
However, you're the first, Mr. Saeba.

188
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,518
Damn! I was so close.

189
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,987
Well, I'll forget about the incident this time.

190
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,184
But honestly, you could cut your
finger off to apologize.

191
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,584
This is a pretty good trap.

192
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,973
I didn't know there was a park like this left in
the city, where there are so many trees.

193
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,668
What a nice feeling!

194
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,343
This is the place where I
met my late husband.

195
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:30,948
This park is for everyone and the
Kichijo Gumi has been protecting it.

196
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,794
This place should stay like this forever.

197
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,591
That's what my husband said all the time.

198
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,964
And this park is what the
ltsukaichi Kai wants to get.

199
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:47,205
They want to destroy this park and
use it for their own ends.

200
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,777
I wonder if the reason you've
taken over the Kichijo Gumi

201
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,008
is to enforce your late husband's will
and protect this park?

202
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,250
It might be one reason.

203
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,853
But I don't have a grand purpose like that.

204
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,422
These green trees, which my husband loved,

205
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,191
are like the people of the Kichijo Gumi.

206
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,326
If I'm not surrounded by the things he loved,

207
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,729
and if I'm not doing something
and staying busy,

208
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,099
I am afraid that my heart, my love,

209
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,903
which was lost because my
husband passed away,

210
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,202
will explode and I will go insane.

211
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,142
Ms. Ayako!

212
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,946
She's like me.

213
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:32,111
I also started working with Ryo in order to
escape the sadness of my brother's death.

214
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,696
Madame's Room
If you enter without permission,
you will be killed!!!!
Masaichi

215
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,614
Did you get lost, Daisuke Serizawa?!

216
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,916
Disappear, vindictive spirit! Purify and purge!

217
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,510
I wouldn't try to sneak into
a lady's room, ever.

218
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,887
What?

219
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,359
Oh, it's just a picture.

220
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,884
What are you doing here in
the middle of the night?

221
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,997
Well, sneaking...

222
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,367
Night watch, it's one of a bodyguard's duties.


223
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,232
Oh, thank you very much.

224
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,105
I am sorry to keep you working
this late for me.

225
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,130
Oh, it's my job.

226
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,640
Wow, did you paint all of these?

227
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,781
Yes, I like painting but I'm not good at it.

228
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,773
Oh, no. The landscapes are beautiful.

229
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,612
What? What is this?

230
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,224
Is this your husband?

231
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,025
Yes!

232
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,492
There he is again.

233
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,159
You put your husband in
every single picture?

234
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,399
My husband loved the nature
of Japan very much.

235
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,973
Every time I find some scenery that he
would love if he were alive,

236
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,677
I want him to see the scene even
if only in my paintings.

237
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,838
How silly of me.

238
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:13,745
What? Your husband isn't in this one.

239
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,158
I was painting that one as a first
anniversary present for him,

240
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,023
but I can't finish it.

241
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,662
Can't finish it?

242
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,365
Since the trouble started with
the ltsukaichi Kai,

243
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,664
everybody worries about me and
won't let me go out.

244
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,936
A little more time, just one more day,
and I could finish it.

245
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,964
One more day.

246
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,345
What a good excuse for a date!

247
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,815
Why don't you go out with me tomorrow
to finish this painting?

248
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,683
But...

249
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,150
It will be okay.

250
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:53,158
Emergency! Mr. Masaichi!

251
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,629
What? Madame and Mr. Saeba are missing?

252
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,696
Yes, Sir.

253
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,833
Jerk! He took Ms. Ayako out!

254
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:05,471
What is he thinking!? If the
ltsukaichi Kai kidnaps her...

255
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,668
Ryo is with her so don't worry
about kidnapping, but...

256
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,514
Oh, my! Hurry up and find them!

257
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,416
If something happens to Madame,
ten fingers won't be enough!

258
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,312
Calm down, Mr. Masaichi!

259
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,825
I'm prepared for this situation!
I put a transmitter in his jacket.

260
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,332
The tracking equipment is in my car,

261
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,596
so we can find out where Ryo is.

262
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,640
Mr. Saburo, please bring my car to
the front from the parking lot.

263
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,975
Yes, Ma'am,

264
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:47,105
but I think he took your car because
there's no car in the parking lot.

265
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,148
Wow, what a nice place!

266
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,064
I wonder if it's okay to go out like
this without telling anyone?

267
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,400
If you told them, they'd stop you, right?
No other choice.

268
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,437
But I wonder if they are worrying about me?

269
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,539
The ltsukaichi Kai members are also
keeping their eye on me.

270
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,006
Don't worry.

271
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,044
They'll understand that you want to
quickly finish this painting.

272
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,781
I guess. Well, I'll hurry and finish it
as fast as I can.

273
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,685
Oh, no, it's okay if it takes you a few days.

274
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,687
What do you mean?

275
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,088
Well, I meant to be careful because
it's an important painting.

276
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,308
There are no obstacles for us
in the great outdoors.

277
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,243
It's just her and I.

278
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:55,214
Human beings need to return
to Mother Nature!

279
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,417
Well, hey, Ayako, the painting is great,

280
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,753
but we've come all the way out here,

281
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,018
so why don't we return to the natural
state of men and women?

282
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,814
Excuse me, Ayako.

283
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,728
All her love is focused into the brush.

284
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:27,212
She is conversing with her late husband
in the silence of nature.

285
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,843
Oh, boy, I guess it's not time yet.

286
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,513
Eight, nine, ten, no, eleven people?!

287
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,461
No, wait.

288
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,420
I can't make a lot of noise and disturb
their conversation, can I?

289
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,756
How is it? Do you like this painting?

290
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,438
I'm sorry, but I was deep in concentration.

291
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,133
Did you get bored?

292
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:33,141
Oh, what? You're finished already?
I wasn't that bored.

293
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,314
I had plenty of friends to play with.

294
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,920
Mr. Saeba...

295
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:49,284
Mr. Masaichi, Madame is back!

296
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,429
Madame!

297
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,395
Well, I'm home now.

298
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,538
What's the matter?

299
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:04,771
Oh, nothing, well, are you,
is your body all right?

300
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,979
What do you mean?

301
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,947
Nothing is wrong.

302
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,182
What's the matter?

303
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,451
No, well, you look fine and I'm relieved.

304
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,011
I'll take this, Madame. You must be tired.

305
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,091
Hey, where are you going?

306
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,027
Do you have any regrets?

307
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,961
No, not at all.

308
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,726
What do you want?

309
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,871
Mr. Ryo, I will forgive what you did today,

310
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,500
but please don't take Madame out
without telling us again.

311
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,978
Madame is very important to all of us.

312
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,749
If something happened to her, we wouldn't
be able to apologize to our late boss.

313
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:47,619
That's why I'm protecting her
as a bodyguard, isn't it?

314
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,850
Your way of protecting her is always
a problem, isn't it?!

315
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,759
There's the previous example of you
trying to peek at her.

316
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,863
Really! You're beside yourself when it
comes to women, aren't you?

317
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,499
Shame on you, Ryo.

318
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,001
I feel ashamed as a man.

319
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,670
Please behave yourself.

320
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,805
You are so serious, Masa.

321
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,708
Since you're a man, you want to
see a beautiful woman

322
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,676
like Ms. Ayako bathing, don't you?

323
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,011
Well, I guess.

324
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,849
But a man has to control feelings like that!

325
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,874
That's the way of the yakuza!

326
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:21,920
That's our obligation to our late boss,

327
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,988
Gl-RI
(Obligation)
That's our obligation to our late boss,

328
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:23,555
Gl-RI
(Obligation)
And that is our loyalty to Madame!

329
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,420
Gl-RI CHUU-SEl
(Obligation) (Loyalty)
And that is our loyalty to Madame!

330
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,161
You mean the Japanese way of chivalry
is strained endurance?

331
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,719
It doesn't look good for your health.

332
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,397
Mr. Masa...

333
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,032
Hey, Gin, what's the matter?

334
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,235
The extra prints of the picture are ready.

335
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,702
Oh, really?!

336
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,708
Wait, form a line. There are enough
copies for all of you.

337
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,177
What kind of picture is that?

338
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,613
Oh, it's a candid photo of Madame.

339
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,671
What? Candid...

340
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,905
Candid photo?


341
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,288
You perverts! You talk big, but
you do things like this.

342
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,755
Give it to me!

343
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,529
It's not in the bath tub!

344
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,165
Who said it was?

345
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,135
We might feel attracted to Madame,

346
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,804
but our fate is to not to do
anything sexual with her.

347
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:18,777
However, we can at least soothe ourselves
by carrying her picture,

348
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,979
and we are all satisfied.

349
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,448
I'm going to laminate this picture and
treat it as a family treasure!

350
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,850
She's so cute, isn't she?

351
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,652
The best part is she's so homey like this.

352
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,416
Who called these guys of the Kichijo Gumi
a Japanese chivalry group?

353
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,090
They look like groupies, don't they?

354
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,148
Really!

355
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,698
City Hunter?

356
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,501
Yes, it's impossible to kidnap the woman

357
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,436
when a guy like that is on the
Kichijo Gumi's side.

358
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,301
Mr. Ootone, what shall we do?

359
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,842
Well, fighting against a man like that
isn't the right way to do it.

360
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,878
Then are we going to withdraw
from the park?

361
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,313
No way!

362
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,316
I'm the kind of person who can get
anything if I really want to.

363
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:02,287
What I am saying is only an idiot would
try to match him one on one.

364
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,652
Which means?

365
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:12,128
Make the land she loves not worth
protecting. It's that simple.

366
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,402
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

367
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,099
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

368
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,001
But I couldn't do so

369
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:37,513
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

370
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:43,917
You don't know the reason I'm here

371
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:58,844
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

372
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,211
I wouldn't have let you go

373
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:10,486
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

374
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:16,727
Everyday life is starting

375
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:27,004
In my mind, time has stopped

376
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:33,344
And a double-decker bus is passing

377
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,120
Ms. Ayako pretends to be cheerful,

378
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,922
but I'm sure she's sad inside.

379

00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,324
I really wanted to make her happy
with my love!

380
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,560
You're sneaking into her room at night
again?! You don't learn anything.

381
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,963
I risked my life to show her the future.
Why don't you get it?

382
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:56,234
Oh, my God, Ryo! Someone set
her park on fire!

383
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,102
What the hell?!

384
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,904
Her special place will be ashes!

385
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,038
City Hunter 2:

386
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,542
"Nineteen Year-Old Widow! Lover in the
Heart of a Beautiful Sketch Artist (Part 2)"

387
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,043
If you miss it, it's going to burn!

388
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:09,002
Please look forward to the next episode
