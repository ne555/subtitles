1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,598
Kimiko Takeda is only seventeen years old,

14
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,468
but tons of suitors constantly appear.

15
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,337
How incredible! I'm sure there's
something behind this incident.


16
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,439
Her grandfather manages the
Takeda Clinic by himself...

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,175
It's not like he's wealthy.

18
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,440
Oh, well, she is so beautiful that if Kimiko
were not my granddaughter,

19
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,948
I would like to make advances to her.

20
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,816
Therefore, I'm positive that's why men
won't leave her alone.

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,886
Don't hide anything from me.

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,113
Kimiko is the granddaughter
of Takako Uesugi,

23
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,121
who is the leader of Uesugi Zaibatsu.

24
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:10,457
Kimiko is to inherit her huge assets and that's
why so many suitors have gathered, isn't it?

25
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,997
How would you know that?

26
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:17,092
Proposal From a Seventeen-Year-Old
Suspicious Date Panic
(Part 2)

27
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,208
I don't know anyone named Uesugi!

28
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,414
Mr. Saeba, the only thing you
have to do is guard Kimiko.

29
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,938
Don't put your nose into anything else!

30
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,278
How stubborn you are!

31
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,657
I followed the guy who visited
here earlier today.

32
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,785
And I heard what Takako Uesugi said.

33
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,393
Kimiko is my son's daughter, she said.

34
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,790
No matter who said whatever,
I don't know that woman.

35
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,605
Father... They're talking about my father!

36
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,347
Kimiko, what are you doing there?

37
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,283
What? I was bringing tea...

38
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,309
I don't need any! Hurry back to
your room and go to bed!

39
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,624
Mr. Saeba, please go back to your room.

40
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,852
Yeah, sure. A good kid is going to bed.

41
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,864
Goodnight, old man.

42
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,663
Something is wrong with Grandpa today.

43
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,437
His attitude is the same as when
I asked about my parents.

44
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,983
Especially when I ask about my father,

45
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,678
he gets mad just like that.

46
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,217
Mr. Saeba, you were talking about
my father, weren't you?

47
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,717
That's why Grandpa was so upset.

48
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,589
I want to know about my parents.

49
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,290
Your grandpa told you. A good girl
has to go to bed now.

50
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,162
I'm not a little kid any more!

51
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,672
When I was little, I found a copy of my
family register in Grandpa's room.

52
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,937
The column where my father's name
was supposed to be was blank.

53
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,509
There was nothing written there.

54
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,447
I didn't understand what that meant at
that time, but now, I understand.

55
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,143
Please tell me, who is my father?!

56
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,616
I understand. Since you know that much,

57
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,920
I'll tell you the truth.

58
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,591
I am your father.

59
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,231
I really do hate you!

60
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,204
I'm just kidding, don't get so mad.

61
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,605
She must have a lousy sense of humor
to not have gotten that joke.

62
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,981
You're the one with a lousy sense
of humor, you shameless jerk!

63
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,006
Oh, Kaori, I didn't know you were here.

64
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,553
He really is the worst!

65
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,714
I'll kick him out of here this time.

66
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,786
Takeda residence.

67
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,057
Hi, Kimiko, how are you?

68
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,303
Ah, no, don't hang up on me!
I didn't call to propose again!

69
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,032
I have a very important thing
to tell you today.

70
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,004
What is it?

71
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,343
I know you will be very interested
in this story.

72
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,413
If you try to irritate me like that,
I'm going to hang up!

73
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,414
Well, wait a second.

74
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:19,052
The reason why we followed you is because
there is a secret about your father.

75
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,350
Don't you want to know what it is?

76
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,089
Takeda
Clinic

77
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:29,354
I wonder where Kimiko went
this early in the morning?

78
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,187
It's no good. She's not at school.

79
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,425
Takeda, why don't we go to
Mrs. Uesugi's house?

80
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,607
Mr. Saeba, are you saying that the
old woman kidnapped Kimiko?

81
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,875
I don't know,

82
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,708
but it's possible we might be able
to get some information.

83
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,723
Is Mr. Takeda here?

84
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,382
Yes, Ma'am. He said he would like to talk.

85
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,931
Eighteen years ago, my only daughter
fell in love with a man.

86
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,975
That old woman's son.

87
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,878
But the master of this family, Takako Uesugi,

88
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,883
accused her of being a filthy woman who
approached her son for money.

89
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,647
Her son dumped my daughter in accordance
with his mother's wishes.

90
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,122
He left for overseas.

91
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,149
At that time, my daughter was
already pregnant with Kimiko.

92
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,886
My daughter was not physically strong.

93
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,191
Since she was shocked by all these things,
the birth was very difficult.

94
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,403
She died, but through a miracle,
the baby was saved.

95
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,171
At that time, I promised myself

96
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,775
that I wouldn't let the baby know
about her cruel father,

97
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,902
and not to talk about him with anybody.

98
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,447
That's why you were so stubborn.

99
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,315
I'd heard that the son of Uesugi
died in a foreign country,

100
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,443
but it had nothing to do with me.

101
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,590
After eighteen years now, I don't know how,

102
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,388
but Ms. Uesugi found out about
the existence of Kimiko,

103
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,630
and she keeps going on about wanting
Kimiko as her successor,

104
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,225
even though she treated
my daughter so badly!

105
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,303
I'm sure that the old woman sent
all those noisy suitors.

106
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,673
Because I won't even talk
to her about Kimiko,

107
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,734
she tries to get Kimiko by using dirty tricks!

108
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,544
Suitors? What are you talking
about, Mr. Takeda?

109
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,848
You old bitch!

110
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,919
Calm down, Takeda.

111
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:42,326
Recently, there have been many suitors
gathering around Kimiko,

112
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,531
and they look like your relatives.

113
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,963
What? But why?

114
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,369
They want the money of the Uesugi family.

115
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,668
They heard that you are going to adopt
Kimiko as your successor.

116
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,578
I hadn't heard about that at all.
How shameless of them!

117
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,638
Liar! I know you plotted all those things!

118
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,180
Cut it out, old man.

119
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,548
I don't know about the past, but
I think that eighteen years

120
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,453
has changed something in this old lady.

121
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,187
The reason why we came here today is
because Kimiko has gone missing.

122
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,029
Kimiko has?

123
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,157
We thought we might be able to
get some information from you.

124
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,602
Kimiko has...

125
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,679
Hello...

126
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,084
That's right, we have Kimiko.

127
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,226
I want you to come get her by yourself.

128
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:56,035
Don't tell anybody about this,
especially not the police.

129
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,559
See you later.

130
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,072
No, I can't let you go by yourself.

131
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,376
But he said he wouldn't hurt Kimiko
in exchange for me.

132
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,619
If I can solve the problem with my life, I...

133
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,315
No, the kidnapper must be
one of your relatives.

134
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,686
I know they don't intend to return
either you or Kimiko alive.

135
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,796
Mr. Saeba, you're the only one
I can rely on now.

136
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,787
I'm sure that you will be
able to rescue Kimiko.

137
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,429
Listen, old woman.

138
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,331
I won't let you see Kimiko even if
she comes back to me safely.

139
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,304
There's no way I'll let her know about the
secret of her birth or of your existence!

140
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,675
Too late, old man.

141
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,642
What?

142
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,911
They made Kimiko go to see them
by telling her

143
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,776
that they would tell her all those things.

144
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,643
If they hadn't, I know she wouldn't
have gone by herself.

145
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,586
I'm the successor of the Uesugi Zaibatsu?

146
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:55,920
Exactly, you're the child of the
heir of Uesugi Zaibatsu.

147
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,656
You're lying! It has to be a mistake!

148
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,026
It's not a lie.

149
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,569
Think about it for a second. How come
dozens of men proposed to you?

150
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,401
All of them want to get the
estate you will receive!

151
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,608
How heartless...

152
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,115
You guys are the worst!

153
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,241
That's not true.

154
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,019
As we promised you, we told you the truth,

155
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,386
and we're also offering to let you
see your grandmother.

156
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,960
I can tell that's not the only thing you want.

157
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,920
I don't think you'll succeed.

158
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,090
I know Mr. Saeba will come to rescue me!

159
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,104
Saeba? You mean that perverted guy?


160
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:42,700
I know Mr. Saeba is kind of a pervert,
but he is my bodyguard.

161
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:49,305
Right, he is my bodyguard.
He'll definitely come to rescue me.

162
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,446
Definitely...

163
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,182
Kimiko!

164
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,222
I wonder if he might not?

165
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,002
I shouldn't have involved
Kimiko in this matter.

166
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,269
This is all my fault.

167
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,316
You might say that, but you
don't have me fooled.

168
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,708
Can you tell me the details?

169
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,984
At that time, I...

170
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,592
There were many people surrounding
me and my son

171
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,492
who approached us just because
of our money.

172
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:41,094
Therefore, the only thing in my mind was to
protect the estate of the Uesugi family.

173
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:45,638
When my son told me that he wanted
to marry Mr. Takeda's daughter,

174
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,233
I could only see her as one of them.

175
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,442
I strongly opposed their marriage,
and tried to separate them.

176
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:04,547
I used one of my employees and put
my son on an overseas project,

177
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,960
where he wouldn't be able to come back
to Japan for at least ten years.

178
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,296
No matter how much she told
my son that she loved him,

179
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,465
if I separated them for a long time,

180
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,424
I believed that my son would change his
mind and concentrate on his work.

181
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,163
However, he didn't.

182
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:24,498
His desperation made his life shorter
than it should have been.

183
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,243
He lost all his will to live,
lost so much weight,

184
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,440
and he talked in delirium.

185
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,182
He said, "She's a good person, please
believe in her," right before he passed away.

186
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:46,491
Then I finally understood how much
my son loved that lady.

187
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,771
And I believed that she couldn't
have been a bad person,

188
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,399
since my son loved her so much.

189
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,402
When I realized that, the Takeda family
was nowhere to be found.

190
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,341
I know that it's impossible to
atone for what I've done.

191
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,887
But I wanted to see you and apologize.

192
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:12,224
Finally, I found you and learned that
your daughter was gone,

193
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,851
and about Kimiko.

194
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,767
I really want both of you to join this family,


195
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,100
and for Kimiko to be my successor.

196
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:32,138
That's the only thing I can do now
to atone for what I've done.

197
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,975
Wait here, everybody.

198
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,954
Please wait.

199
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:46,687
Let me go. They will be more off-guard
if I go than if you go.

200
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,588
Ms. Uesugi, it's too dangerous.

201
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,786
No, I have to go.

202
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,999
Okay, then you can help me.

203
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,258
Ryo?!

204
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,902
Ms. Uesugi...

205
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,782
I'm sure you're a lot younger than I am,

206
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,310
but you look as old as I am, maybe older.

207
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,957
You must also have been suffering
for eighteen years.


208
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:27,423
Maybe I haven't suffered so because
Kimiko was with me.

209
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,332
Mr. Takeda...

210
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,377
Mr. Saeba, I'm counting on you
to protect her,

211
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,437
so that Kimiko can see her grandmother
for the first time.

212
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,294
It's getting colder tonight.

213
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,967
Brother!

214
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,441
Here she comes! Grandma's alone!

215
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,106
She came.

216
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,717
Well, well, my grandaunt, welcome!

217
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,050
You...

218
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,397
You're all without shame.

219
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,763
Is Kimiko all right?

220
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,901
Sure, she's fine.

221
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,960
If you want to see her, hurry up
and come this way.

222
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,371
Sure, I'll be right there.

223
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,874
Well done, old lady.

224
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,084
Thanks to you, I was able to separate
those guys from Kimiko.

225
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,325
Why are you with her?!

226
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,553
Damn! You tricked us!

227
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,789
Look who's talking.

228
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,699
It was all right while you
were chasing the girl,

229
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,635
or trying to sneak into her bedroom,

230
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,627
because I do those kinds
of things sometimes.

231
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,974
Oh, especially sneaking into the bedroom.

232
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,077
It's thrilling and gives a
feeling of achievement,

233
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,706
as if tears pour from our eyes
for the joy of life...

234
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,950
Well, back to the subject.

235
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,418
In my case, my purpose is
usually very pure.

236
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:33,316
Never once have I done things with
a twisted purpose like yours!

237
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,900
Now, I'll have you return Kimiko to me.

238
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,470
Jerk! What a big mouth!

239
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,938
You approached the old woman and
the kid for money, didn't you?

240
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,566
Hey!

241
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,865
Okay.

242
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,884
I thought something like this might happen.
This barrel contains oil.

243
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,988
If you come any closer, I'll pull the
string hooked to this grenade.

244
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,488
She'll be surrounded by fire in an instant.

245
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,326
Mr. Saeba...

246
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,335
Hey, baby, look.

247
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,168
That's the evil grandma who
chased your mother away.

248
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,397
What an emotional meeting!

249
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,942
That woman is my grandmother?!

250
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,342
Kimiko!

251
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,013
Now throw your gun on the ground.

252
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,212
Or I'll make it go boom!

253
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,153
Why don't you try it?

254
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,485
I won't drop my gun, nor will I stop coming.

255
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,123
What?!

256
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,226
Kimiko!

257
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,759
Kimiko!

258
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,534
Brother!

259
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:53,794
Stop!

260
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,918
I said stop! Didn't you hear me?!

261
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,182
Brother, I don't care! Kill them both!

262
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,246
Stop! Hurry up and escape or you'll die too!

263
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,859
Both of you, go to Hell!

264
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,469
What? It sounded quieter than it should have.

265
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,579
Well, what are you going to do?
Both of them are still fine.

266
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,657
Just in case, I prepared a backup. Look!

267
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,896
Now they'll burn to a crisp!

268
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,474
Why did it come back?!

269
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,887
Hurry up!

270
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,944
Thank you very much, Mr. Saeba. I...

271
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,721
I thought I wasn't going to make it!

272
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,519
Hey, hey, stop. Your grandmother is here.

273
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,573
This is why I was against it.

274
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,184
You're really mean. I said I don't
want to inherit your money.

275
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:23,956
You say so, Kimiko, but you should
understand how Ms. Uesugi feels.

276
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,447
But we've just met,

277
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:31,586
and I don't want to hear about
the money after you die.

278
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,198
I've lived seventeen years without
knowing about you at all.

279
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,671
Now, I have a real grandma,

280
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,730
but you're only talking about stupid stuff.

281
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,980
That's mean.

282
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,524
First we should bring back the
seventeen years we lost.

283
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,357
Grandma, Grandpa and me, all three of us!

284
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,421
Kimiko, in spite of what I've done,
you can call me Grandma.

285
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,090
Thank you very much.

286
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,904
What is that package?

287
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,963
I know. It's a picture of your father, right?

288
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,644
I thought the reason why Grandpa
didn't tell me about my father,

289
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,846
and why there was no picture of my father,

290
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,349
was because my father was a bad person.

291
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,385
But that's not true.

292
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,154
My father loved my mother very much,

293
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,122
and she loved him too.

294
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,584
I found out that my parents were
like that, so I'm very happy.

295
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,931
I'm sure you'll be able to find a man
like your father someday.

296
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,928
I might have already met him!

297
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,799
Ms. Uesugi, I've already decided
who will be Kimiko's husband.

298
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,566
Oh, me too!

299
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,810
I've got a bad feeling.

300
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,648
Mr. Saeba...

301
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,173
Why the hell are you staring at me?

302
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,219
That's a scary thought.

303
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,846
Goodbye!

304
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,222
Oh, wait for me, Mr. Saeba.

305
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,027
Where are you going? You are
my fianc

306
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,092
No way! We were just putting on an act!

307
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,502
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

308
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,199
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

309
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,101
But I couldn't do so

310
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:37,614
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

311
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:44,017
You don't know the reason I'm here

312
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:58,944
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

313
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,311
I wouldn't have let you go

314
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:10,586
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

315
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:16,827
Everyday life is starting

316
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:27,104
In my mind, time has stopped

317
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,444
And a double-decker bus is passing

318
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,721
Next door, in what we call the zombie room,
the shadow of a human being has appeared!

319
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,757
Ah, that was Maiko, a dancer
who has moved in.

320
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,160
Indeed, you're a professional Peeping Tom.
You already knew.

321
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,963
It seems someone attacked Maiko,
and she asked me to guard her.

322
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,933
But no one can go into her theater
unless they're part of the cast.

323
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,901
If I have an audition, it will be no problem.

324
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,263
If you pass!

325
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,704
City Hunter 2:

326
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,608
"Success Story in Shinjuku -
The Neighbor is a Beautiful Dancer (Part 1)"

327
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,303
If you miss it, a zombie will appear!

328
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,369
Please look forward to the next episode
