Ryo!

16
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,699
A midnight visit? With me?

17
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,114
A little bit more...

18
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,791
Ryo!

19
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,700
What the hell is he up to, passing my
bed without doing anything?

20
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,978
There's something in the zombie room
where nobody lives!

Success Story in Shinjuku
The Neighbor is a Beautiful Dancer
(Part 1)

22
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,626
I hear you.

23
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,253
Good morning, sparrows.

24
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,266
What? You want to see it again?

25
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,200
Okay, it'll wake me up too!

26
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,393
Ouch!

27
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,796
Wait a second, I...

28
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,740
Finally, I got you, thief!

29
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,581
I'm sorry, but I think you've made a mistake.

30
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,049
I live next door.

31
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,481
You're the neighbor?

32
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,884
Antiseptic Solution

33
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,125
Anyway, I'm very impressed by your device.

34
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,094
Sorry, but I thought you were a thief.

35
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,130
But anyway, why were you there?

36
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,703
Well, it's a very rare opportunity that
someone moved in here,

37
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,068
so I came to greet...

38
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,901
Do you usually greet someone
through the skylight?

39
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,846
No, but this time it's special.
When did you move in here?

40
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,247
A week ago. My name is Maiko Tsugihara.
Nice to meet you.

41
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,184
I'm Ryo Saeba.

42
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,278
Why don't you come over to my place
to have a cup of morning tea?

43
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,064
Excuse me, but why go up to the rooftop,
instead of going to the door?

44
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,166
This is the shortcut.

45
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,768
There is another shorter cut,

46
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,531
but in order to go that way,

47
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,100
we have to go through a
very dangerous person.

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,571
Who did you call a very dangerous person?

49
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,047
Wow, you're a dancer, Ms. Maiko?

50
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,891
An unpopular dancer.

51
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,694
I can't believe you got the zombie room
where the ghost lives.

52
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,321
People talked about it all the time.

53
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,831
Yes, but I don't have any money,

54
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,595
so I couldn't let the unbelievably
cheap rent on the poster go.

55
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,304
But I've heard that there were some
people who rented the place,

56
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,535
then saw the ghost and went insane!

57
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,568
Really?

58
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,442
It's okay. There's no ghost in the room.

59
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,916
Every time a woman moves in there,

60
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,952
Ryo must go to peep in the room,

61
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,521
and they think it is the ghost.

62
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,113
I'm sure of it.

63
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,054
But I wasn't worrying about it anyway.

64
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,521
I have a powerful charm.

65
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,822
Let me see.

66
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,161
What the hell are you doing?

67
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,527
I wonder what?

68
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,860
This is it.

69
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,970
A mascot doll?

70
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,597
It's your guardian charm?

71
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,638
The day when I got this doll,
I passed the audition.

72
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,240
I was finally able to be on the stage
as I'd been dreaming.

73
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,408
Finally, but...

74
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,713
But the ghost?

75
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,052
No! Anyway, please come to my room.


76
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,063
This scratch was surely made
by moving furniture.

77
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,664
I've never moved the cabinet
since I moved in here,

78
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,663
and I can't move it by myself anyway.


79
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,778
I feel like someone's coming in
and out while I'm not at home.

80
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,144
The arrangement of my belongings
has changed slightly.

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,610
But there's nothing missing or stolen, so the
police don't take it seriously, do they?

82
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,673
Right.

83
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,753
Then you got scared and
created the gadget?

84
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,293
Yes, also, I've felt somebody watching me.

85
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,784
Someone's following me around at night.

86
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,159
I'm getting kind of scared.

87
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,237
I see. That's why you left a memo on
the board at Shinjuku Station,

88
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,637
in order to keep me as your other charm.

89
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,105
Then you're...

90
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,312
You went to check the board without
telling me, didn't you?

91
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,584
Anyway, Ms. Maiko, he's skilled at protection,

92
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,212
but he's not as quiet as your doll charm.

93
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,048
Here.


94
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,685
You see? He has this kind of bad hobby.

95
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,556
If it's okay for you, you can
use him as a second charm.

96
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,096
I need more time to think about it.

97
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:59,037
Something is chasing me.
Somebody help me!

98
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,604
Mr. Neighbor!

99
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,218
Calm down. I'll protect you.

100
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,845
But the pay will be...

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,188
What are you doing all of a sudden?!

102
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,791
I want to get paid with the underwear
you're wearing now!

103
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,587
Divine Punishment

104
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,751
Cut it out! You king of the sudden perverts!

105
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,371
What a nightmare!

106
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,747
Mr. Saeba, why are you here
without my permission?!

107
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,216
Here you go. Breakfast is served.

108
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,684
Breakfast, you said, but...

109
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,151
Hey, Ryo!

110
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,984
You went into Ms. Maiko's room without
her permission again?!

111
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,430
What? Can you say things like that?

112
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,100
Who are those people? Reality and
my dream seem the same!
What the hell are you doing, trying to
change the subject?

113
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,935
Who are those people? Reality and
my dream seem the same!
Be prepared!

114
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:56,902
Who are those people? Reality and
my dream seem the same!

115
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,237
That's enough!

116
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,443
Listen to me very carefully.

117
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,184
I haven't said anything about whether
I would hire you or not.

118
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:20,589
No way, you're the one who left
the XYZ memo on the board.

119
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,157
If I'd known that it was you, I wouldn't have.


120
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,327
All this sneaking in is a problem for me!

121
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,168
But someone was following you
at night, wasn't he?

122
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:33,571
You'll be scared until you find out why
someone's doing that, right?

123
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,132
That's...

124
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,104
But I'm not in any actual danger,
if I look at it another way.

125
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,582
That's why I'm working for you,
before you get into any danger...

126
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,183
No thank you!

127
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,675
I'm very busy because I have to work during
the day and go to my lessons at night.

128
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,787
But...

129
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,825
Get the hell out of here.

130
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,394
Oh, my...

131
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,918
I guess she's serious.

132
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,098
Why don't you go back to your
room through the door?!

133
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,593
Goodbye for now.

134
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,405
Man, I'd be calmer dealing with the
ghost than with those two!

135
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,545
Oh, no! Time to work!

136
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,176
I have to hurry.

137
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,015
Mr. Saeba!

138
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,616
How'd you know?

139
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,530
Donald Mag

140
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,836
What's the matter, Maiko?
Are you sick or something?

141
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,566
No, nothing's wrong. Thank you.

142
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,705
Here, a Donald burger, cola,
and fries are ready.

143
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,201
Okay!

144
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,048
What's the matter? Customers are waiting.

145
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,572
Take these to them before they get cold.

146
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,550
Manager!

147
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,079
What's the matter, Maiko?

148
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,348
Manager, why is he here?

149
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,823
Mr. Saeba, you're already trying to
hit on a girl, aren't you?

150
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,794
I didn't do anything. Maiko is making
trouble all by herself.

151
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,989
Oh, are you sure?

152
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,001
I'll treat you to something delicious,

153
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,231
so don't cause any problems, please.

154
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,531
Gotcha.

155
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,165
Wow, I'm so happy. A promise
with Mr. Saeba! Great!

156
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,744
Manager!

157
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,372
That's how it is. Good to work with you.

158
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,980
I've always been a good friend with
the managers at this shop.

159
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,184
I see...

160
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,291
Ladies Changing Room

161
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,631
I'm exhausted because of him.

162
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,861
Should I find another place
to work tomorrow?

163
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,300
Oh, you're early! Is it time to go home?

164
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,006
Enough is enough!

165
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,743
Never, ever show your face to me again!

166
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,691
I can't believe I have to deal
with a jerk like him!

167
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:18,529
Mr. Saeba, I understand very well the
reason you do these things.

168
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,608
Finally, you understand my efforts.

169
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,374
Right, you're just such a pervert!

170
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,942
What are you talking about?
I care about you very much.

171
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,720
You've got some nerve, after peeping on me

172
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,822
and grabbing the underwear
in the locker room!

173
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,620
Ah, well, it was just a little joke.

174
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,227
I thought it was strange.

175
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,933
The person who snuck into my room, and
chased me at night and scared me,

176
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,230
all those were you, weren't they?

177
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,369
You're mistaken.

178
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,405
You planned all those things to get to
approach me, didn't you?

179
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,301
Maiko!

180
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,377
She's gone.

181
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,588
Damn! Having him as a neighbor
is the worst!

182
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,523
I wish I had money so I could
move out of there!

183
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,251
Come to think of it...

184
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,996
Someone chased me down this
dark road last night.

185
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,738
No! He planned that too.

186
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,605
There is no way that there's anybody
else who's trying to get me.

187
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,840
Who is it? Mr. Saeba, right?

188
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,810
I told you not to follow me, didn't I?

189
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,648
That's not him!

190
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,265
What's going on?! It's the same
as my dream this morning!

191
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,704
Mr. Saeba?

192
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,239
Somebody help me!

193
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,709
Mr. Saeba...

194
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,816
Mr. Saeba!

195
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,286
Yo!

196
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:26,690
Well, Mr. Stockings, why don't you tell
me why you attacked Maiko?

197
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:27,933
Damn!

198
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,034
I won't let you go!

199
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,302
No, Mr. Saeba.

200
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,997
Don't leave me alone in a place like this.

201
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,768
Please!

202
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,572
Okay, I got you. You're all right now.

203
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,549
I'm sorry, Mr. Saeba. I said
such mean things.

204
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,414
You were absolutely right.

205
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:50,545
If I ask you to guard me now, you'd
think I'm selfish, wouldn't you?

206
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,348
No, I wouldn't. I'd be happy to.

207
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,657
Mr. Saeba...

208
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,696
But, Mr. Saeba...

209
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,224
Why is your hand touching my butt?

210
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,002
Why? Ryo doesn't understand why.

211
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:28,459
Maiko, it's morning!

212
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,296
IDIOT

213
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,800
Can't you come up with a better idea
for waking her up?

214
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,668
Why is Kaori here?

215
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,105
I'm sorry, but Ms. Maiko is
sleeping in my room.

216
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,410
What?

217
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,147
Hi, Mr. Saeba, good morning.

218
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,206
It's been a long time since I've enjoyed
a nice morning like this.

219
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,879
No way!

220
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:56,355
We were in the same building all through
the night and I didn't realize it?

221
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,652
I'm a fool!

222
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,588
By the way, what's your schedule
today, Maiko?

223
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:11,028
Rehearsal is starting today at
the Toto Theater, every day.

224
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,968
Then I'll go with you as your bodyguard.

225
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,940
But you can't.

226
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,975
Why?

227
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,944
During practice, it's off limits to strangers.

228
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,740
The director of the play is really secretive.

229
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,279
That will be a problem.

230
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,406
I wonder if there's a way to get in?

231
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,587
Today, the only people who can
get in the building

232
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,919
other than the cast and crew
are the auditioners.

233
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,421
Audition?

234
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,721
Yes, there aren't enough people
in the chorus line,

235
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,728
so they suddenly decided to audition
today for those parts.

236
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,898
That's it! I'll take that audition.

237
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:46,767
If I pass, I can go in the theater
as one of the show's cast.

238
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,409
How stupid are you? It's not like
you can dance!

239
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,967
Can I borrow this leotard?

240
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,346
If I wear your leotard and dance,
I'm sure I will pass the audition!

241
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:58,478
No?

242
00:16:58,884 --> 00:16:59,680
No way.

243
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,388
A man doesn't need to wear those things.

244
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,548
Oh, that's too bad.

245
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,024
What? What is this string?

246
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,553
These are panties! What kind of perverse
panties do you have?!

247
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,999
Kaori's weight

248
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,367
Kaori's weight
What's perverse?

249
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,505
Kaori's weight
This is for a leotard, so the panty lines
don't show through!

250
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,767
Kaori's weight
Oh, really?

251
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,142
Are they that perverse?

252
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,210
Toto Theater

253
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,278
There's so many people here!

254
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,621
Only one man and one woman will be
selected from all these people.

255
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,055
They're all the same as I am.

256
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,860
Everybody here has been dancing

257
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,725
in order to be the star tomorrow.

258
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,998
No matter how small the part is,

259
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,967
they want to express their very
best skills on the stage,

260
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,425
want to make the director recognize
them, want to go forward.

261
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:58,375
And someday, they want to be a
dancer in a Broadway show.

262
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,247
The eyes of all these people show
that they have that dream.

263
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,649
This is such a serious world.

264
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,479
And you're the main character
in such a world.

265
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,814
Main character? No way!

266
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,158
I'm still one of the supporting parts.

267
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,855
There are many people who can dance
better and more beautifully.

268
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,196
But someday, I would like to be...

269
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,167
It's amazing.

270
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,204
Women who can dance better than you,
more beautiful than you,

271
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,672
all wearing that kind of thong...

272
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,910
Why don't you die, you two?

273
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,580
Why don't you go home?

274
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,572
I know you can't pass the audition
competing with all these people.

275
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,077
That's you. Why did you
come to the audition?

276
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,987
I've been training myself by doing
jazz dance and aerobics.

277
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,717
I have a better chance than you do, Ryo.

278
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:54,257
I see. You wear a thong
every day, don't you?

279
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,296
Now the audition is about to start.

280
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,840
First of all, we'll see the men.

281
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,332
Meanwhile, ladies, please change in
the locker room and wait.

282
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,149
For the first test, I want you to dance
whatever you are good at by yourself.

283
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,845
The number you got at the reception
shows your turn.

284
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,352
Oh, I'm number one.

285
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,447
Wow, congratulations. You'll be
the first failure.

286
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,989
Now, number one, please go ahead.

287
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,324
Mr. Saeba, are you really all right?

288
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,662
Well, just wait and see.

289
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,635
Why is he so confident?

290
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,072
Number one, Ryo Saeba.

291
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,206
Incredible!

292
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,084
What beautifully taut chest muscles
Mr. Saeba has!

293
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,389
And his strong thighs, and
nicely shaped butt.

294
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,357
Those are ideal for a dancer.

295
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,528
I wonder if Mr. Saeba has
experience in dancing?

296
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,265
I don't know, but he sometimes
can do unbelievable things.

297
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,391
But no way.

298
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,979
What a jump! Just as I thought!

299
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,979
Go home, you.

300
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,323
Just as I thought.

301
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,295
Of course, I knew he can't dance.

302
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:38,035
Damn, now I won't be able to see the
butts of thong-wearing girls.

303
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,874
Wait a second, during the men's competition,

304
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,434
the girls are changing in the locker room.

305
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:51,049
That's right. How could I go home now?!

306
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,176
Women's
Locker Room

307
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,712
Thongs...

308
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,578
What?

309
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,660
Here you are, just as I thought, you octopus!

310
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,718
Divine Punishment

311
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,732
So many butts!

312
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,703
Oh, damn!

313
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,113
Wait for me, my butts! Butts, butts!

314
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,580
Hey, wait!
Wait for me, my butts! Butts, butts!

315
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,638
Hey, wait!

316
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,382
What the hell?!



317
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,553
Don't tell me...

318
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,999
Finally, I got you, you crazy!

319
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,474
You guys!

320
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,710
What the hell are you doing?!

321
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,873
You destroyed all the sets
we made for the play!

322
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,816
I'll have you take responsibility for them!

323
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,785
You have to repair all these sets
as stagehands.

324
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,548
I'll use you without any pay until
the show starts. Understand?!

325
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,425
No way...

326
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:10,629
But now we can come here
as part of the crew.

327
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,596
Jerk!

328
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:12,790
Right? Right?

329
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:17,135
Guitar o kikase ta katta

330
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,832

Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

340
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,154
How is your close-up guarding without
getting paid anything?

341
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,255
Got anything yet?

342
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,792
Sure I do. There are suspicious people
sniffing around Maiko.

343
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,794
Then do you know who the suspect is?

344
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,659
The game will start after the
play starts showing.

345
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,531
I'm sure they will attack her then.

346
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,091
By the way, what do they
