1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,943
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,520
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,866
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,173
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:49,977
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,983
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:01,561
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:06,157
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:11,428
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:16,765
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:28,282
Shining smile, don't hurry and as it is, kiss

12
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,664
What's wrong, Ryo? Is this date
with me that boring?

13
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,140
You're always deceiving me.
I don't quite trust you.

14
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:55,607
My, my, even I just want to enjoy
myself from time to time.

15
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,812
Today, I'm just your average citizen.

16
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,613
I left my notebook at home.

17
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,625
And your handcuffs?

18
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,093
Those too!

19
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,618
And your concealed weapon? Nope!

20
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,330
Ryo!

21
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,228
I already told you I'm off today.

22
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:19,973
Meaning, you don't need to get back until
work starts tomorrow to be precise.

23
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,340
That all depends on how I feel
during this little drive.

24
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,272
All right! The mokkori night I've
always hoped for!

25
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:33,007
Moving Violation in Love!
Ryo and the Beautiful Motorcycle Cop

26
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,417
Saeko, do you want me to drive?

27
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,489
No, thanks. I was the one who invited you.

28
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,186
Really? All right.

29
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,272
That man...

30
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,177
I'm certain of it!

31
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,218
What's going on?!

32
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,058
This way will take us right back to Tokyo!

33
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,389
Stop your yelling!

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,996
What about our date?! This isn't the plan!

35
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,266
If you must blame someone, blame the guy
in the Mercedes in front of us.

36
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,202
Who the heck is that guy?

37
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,432
An important suspect in a
case I'm investigating.

38
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,867
Case?! Come on, Saeko!

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,310
It was a complete coincidence!
What a lucky break!

40
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,835
But not for me!

41
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,717
That Porsche, I think it's following us.

42
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,862
Lose it.

43
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,260
Yes, Sir.

44
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,930
Get out of my way! I'll arrest you for
interfering with an officer!

45
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,661
All right!

46
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,517
Are you trying to kill us?!

47
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,984
They're not getting away!

48
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,790
Of all times...

49
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,231
I'm in a hurry!

50
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:27,900
Your license!

51
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,798
A lady!

52
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,774
She's cute!

53
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,075
Ryo!

54
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,441
I'm a detective. I'm in pursuit of a suspect.

55
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,280
Your ID, please.

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,747
Sure.

57
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,145
No! I left my ID at home!

58
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,615
Today was my day off.

59
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,817
Are you driving without a license?

60
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,886
How rude, of course I have a license.

61
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,894
Wait in your car.

62
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,629
Look how far ahead the car you
were chasing has gotten.

63
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,102
Ryo, I need your help here.

64
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,308
You're going to leave me here
to take the heat?!

65
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,639
Ping-pong!

66
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,837
Hug her or do whatever you have to.

67
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,945
Just make sure she doesn't follow me!

68
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,105
Hug her?! She's a police officer!

69
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,907
I'll clear this up later.

70
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,625
I can't believe her!

71
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,592
Wait!

72
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,528
Let go!

73
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,793
No way! I've got official police
sanction for this one!

74
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,865
I'm getting compensation for
my lost mokkori night!

75
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,661
I'm arresting you for interfering with an officer
and commission of a misdemeanour offense!

76
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,064
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:09,068
Oh! My tailbone in my butt is still stinging.

78
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,936
In your butt? Do people have tailbones
in other places too?

79
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,443
You certainly are the ingenuous type.

80
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,536
I'm sorry. That's how I am.

81
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,516
How can I possibly apologize for this?

82
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,747
It's okay, it's okay. You don't need to
concern yourself about me.

83
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,487
It's Detective Nogami that
I'm concerned about.

84
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,260
It's true I was doing my duty,

85
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,320
but that doesn't excuse the fact that
an important suspect escaped.

86
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:41,465
That's what she said on the phone.
She said she lost them near Yokohama.

87
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,935
Right...

88
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,497
With the way it ended up, we should have
just gone on our mokkori night drive.

89
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,568
Mokkori night drive?

90
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,399
Oh, it's nothing.

91
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,284
What's your name?

92
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,619
My name's Kiyomi.

93
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,109
Want to go out sometime?

94
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,323
What should I say?

95
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,848
I'm telling you, it's not that complicated.

96
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,616
It'd be better to meet.

97
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,689
I'd better go meet Detective Nogami
in person and apologize.

98
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,692
But... Hey, wait!

99
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,334
Kiyomi!

100
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,744
I thought she was wondering whether
to date me. What a downer!

101
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,072
Today just isn't my day!

102
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,345
What a rotten day.

103
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,190
It was all that lousy bum's fault for
showing up when he did!

104
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,961
That idiot!

105
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,759
I'll get drunk tonight!

106
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:54,032
But that Officer Kiyomi, she was
so untainted, fresh and cute.

107
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,807
So different from Kaori!

108
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,676
Who am I different from?!

109
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,447
You're home so early.

110
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,783
Weren't you going out to drink
all night with a friend?

111
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,718
Oh, yeah, my friend, that's right.

112
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,812
My friend couldn't make it, so zippo!

113
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,259
You're sure acting funny.

114
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,196
Hey, what do you think is in this box?

115
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:17,997
Clothes?

116
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
You're close!

117
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,568
The answer is a fur coat by Rich A. Wool!

118
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,594
Rich A. Wool?! You mean that
top name brand?!

119
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,840
You do know!

120
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,309
Tada!

121
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,833
Kaori!

122
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,544
Oh, a label to make any girl shed tears of joy.

123
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,785
No touching it with your grubby hands!

124
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,755
Must have cost a pretty penny.

125
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:46,623
See, it's off season. It was on sale
for less than half-price.

126
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,090
What a find! Well, does it look good?

127
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,762
It is the best stuff after all.

128
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,602
Whatever, whatever. I won't get angry
today no matter what you say.

129
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,968
I bet it'd look even better on Kiyomi though.

130
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,740
Who's Kiyomi?

131
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,341
She's a popular model!

132
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:07,404
I'm too excited to sleep tonight.
I'm going to look in the mirror!

133
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,610
Goodnight!

134
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,811
No wonder she's in a good mood.

135
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,788
Kiyomi...

136
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,802
Ryo!

137
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,895
Kaori! Wait! See...

138
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,839
Come on, I was drinking all night
and I'm sleepy.

139
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,916
I'm so angry!

140
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,551
What the heck is it?
I'm so angry!

141
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,984
I'm so angry!

142
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,179
Fake Rich A. Wool brand?

143
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,892
You mean this is fake?!

144
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,157
I'm so angry! It's fake! Look!

145
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,127
The fur just comes right out!
Right out! Right out!

146
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:08,163
I'm not taking it! I'm not taking it!
Not taking it!

147
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,633
How dare they exploit a woman's dream?!

148
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,911
I'm not leaving this to the police!

149
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:17,511
I'll catch them with my own bare hands!

150
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,415
Scary! The rancor of a woman!

151
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:28,861
Hello, this is Saeba. Kiyomi?
You mean Officer Kiyomi?!

152
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,058
How did you find me? Oh, from my license.

153
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,026
I thought Kiyomi was a model.

154
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,402
She's a model who works part-time
as a police officer.

155
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,494
No, I got it backwards.

156
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,375
It's about a speeding ticket.
I'm in big trouble!

157
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,342
Hello.

158
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,875
You want to meet me? Yes, I understand.
I'll appear.

159
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,413
See?

160
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,458
I see. So this is the guy Saeko is after.

161
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,792
He sticks the Rich A. Wool label on shoddy
garments and sells them in large quantities.

162
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,598
Rich A. Wool?

163
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,732
Do you know something?

164
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,666
No, no. He was in the paper this morning.

165
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,701
That's right. For a half-price Rich A. Wool,
I'd be tempted myself.

166
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,562
And that makes me even angrier.

167
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:22,242
So, when I think of how I allowed him to
escape Detective Nogami, it just...

168
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,151
Mr. Saeba, please help me!

169
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,686
Help you?

170
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,951
Detective Nogami has told me that
you are a private detective.

171
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,956
She says you're the best.

172
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,821
Guarding beautiful ladies is my specialty!

173
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,130
I just met Detective Nogami.

174
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,232
I asked her to add me to
her investigation team

175
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,268
in way of apology for letting him get away.

176
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,536
And?

177
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,004
I was refused.

178
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,773
She said she appreciated my offer,
but I'm not an investigator.

179
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,104
Not surprised.

180
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,277
But I can't just do nothing.

181
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,544
Gotcha, I'll hold on to this photo.

182
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,317
Mr. Saeba...

183
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,351
I'm glad I called you.

184
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,001
Looks like a business owner from
the Chinese quarter?

185
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,300
Right, and he's a man of unsavoury
reputation, it appears.

186
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,340
All done.

187
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,638
All right, here you go.

188
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,743
Be careful, Ryo.

189
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,035
Thank you.

190
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,374
This is going to get me mokkori with Kiyomi!

191
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,973
Kiyomi!

192
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,298
Sorry for being late.

193
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,444
You like to wear Chinese dresses?

194
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,238
This is rented.

195
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:09,513
You told me on the phone the man in the
photo owns a Chinese restaurant, right?

196
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,815
So I thought a Chinese dress
might be a smart idea.

197
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,450
You are the conscientious type.

198
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,896
Was it a mistake?

199
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,264
Not at all!

200
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,324
I feel like forgetting this stake-out
and running off with you myself.

201
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,568
That's a relief.

202
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,197
That's his restaurant across the street, right?

203
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,512
I'm asking about his restaurant.

204
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,002
Oh, yeah! That's it, that's it!

205
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,050
We can't see inside of the restaurant
from this location.

206
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,575
It is hard to see from here.

207
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,189
Mr. Saeba!

208
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,023
Yes!

209
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,082
I wonder if he's inside the restaurant now?

210
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,019
No, not yet.

211
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,486
Maybe we should wait inside
his restaurant then.

212
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,789
His schedule appears to vary.

213
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:57,293
If we have to wait a long time inside the
restaurant for him, it'll arouse suspicion.

214
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,998
I see. You're right.

215
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,176
He may not show up today.

216
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,690
I don't mind. I arranged for
a day off tomorrow.

217
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,658
I can wait here as long as necessary.

218
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,761
That means you can stay out
all day tomorrow,

219
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,730
PLUS the next day until time for duty.

220
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,799
That's right. I can just sit tight and wait.

221
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,272
No, let's call it a day right now and
come back first thing in the morning.

222
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:37,509
It doesn't look like he's coming, so let's just
go to a hotel and rest up for tomorrow.

223
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,273
Don't worry. I have a lot of endurance.

224
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,482
What if he shows up while we're in the hotel?

225
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,949
I guess so.

226
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,319
The man in the photo!

227
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,326
What rotten luck I'm having!

228
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,131
What do you mean?!
Our luck couldn't be better!

229
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,828
No, what I meant was,
too bad Saeko isn't here.

230
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,993
I'll do my best in Detective Nogami's place!

231
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,113
The best way to avoid their suspicion
at night in the Chinese quarter

232
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,604
is to pretend to be lovers.

233
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,555
On behalf of the good people of the world
and the women he so cruelly deceived,

234
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,716
I will punish him myself!

235
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,894
Kaori!
Ryo!

236
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,663
What the heck are you doing here?!

237
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,221
That's what I want to ask you!

238
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,201
Someone you know?

239
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,294
Yeah, you could say that. This is Kiyomi.

240
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,572
Go on in, I'll be right there.

241
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,664
Roger!

242
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,042
Hey!

243
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,210
Keep it down!

244
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,179
That crook we've been staking out
could get away!

245
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,511
What? You did this for me?

246
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,850
Yes, that's right!

247
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,987
How could I do nothing after
what you told me?

248
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,616
I'm so happy! You came to
get revenge for me!

249
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,602
Rich A. Wool!

250
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,208
A fake Rich A. Wool fur coat!

251
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,721
All the evidence I need!

252
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,926
So it's true the cops have found me out, is it?

253
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,418
We've got to hurry. It's just a matter
of time before they raid us.

254
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,130
Things are that bad?

255
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,734
I'm gonna have the stuff moved
somewhere else without delay.

256
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,340
I've got a boat ready.

257
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,343
Boss! Word is that the police
are gonna make a raid!

258
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,503
You gotta get outta here!

259
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,479
Get that stuff moved!

260
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,969
Yes, Sir!

261
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,152
Ryo, is it all right to leave
Officer Kiyomi by herself?

262
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,017
Yeah, you're right! Let's go, Kaori!

263
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,289
Damn! Kaori, hurry!

264
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,722
Mr. Saeba! They plan to escape by boat!

265
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:43,996
That coat!

266
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,760
It's evidence! It was in the basement!

267
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,489
Hurry up, Saeba!

268
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,027
I'm in luck! The key's in it!

269
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,996
This darn dress!

270
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,109
A mokkori thigh!

271
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,110
Saeba!

272
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,168
Ryo!

273
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,610
A police woman no less, you vile man!

274
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,445
Miss! Police officers are on their way!

275
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,721
Please give this to them and tell them
it's evidence! Thanks.

276
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,846
Wait!

277
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,428
Damn!

278
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,663
Ryo!

279
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,864
Thanks!

280
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,354
Wait!

281
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,558
Don't forget to leave something for me!

282
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,113
Saeko! Ryo's gone after your man!
This is evidence.

283
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,013
Get in!

284
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,640
He's getting away by boat!

285
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,735
Hurry!

286
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,944
There!

287
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,671
You're not getting away!

288
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,089
Idiot! There's no way you can catch us.

289
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,010
I'm arresting you for dealing in
counterfeit merchandise.

290
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,344
Stop this boat immediately!

291
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,142
That will be enough of your
gallantry, young lady.

292
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,277
Take those handcuffs and cuff
yourself to the handrail.

293
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,887
Do it!

294
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,794
You make a good hostage. Sit quiet
until we get to the ship.

295
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,034
Saeba!

296
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,365
Are you okay, Kiyomi?

297
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,602
Thanks, Saeba.

298
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,453
There you are! You're not getting away!

299
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,053
Taste a woman's wrath!

300
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,705
Thank you, Kaori. I finally have him.

301
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,534
We did it.

302
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,278
Are you listening? Take us back to Tokyo!

303
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,478
Ryo, I have to go to work!

304
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,492
The other day you worked on your day off.

305
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,228
Just make this a make-up day off!

306
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,128
You know I can't do that!

307
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,122
Oh, no!

308
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,765
You were speeding.

309
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,948
Detective Nogami, you've been requested
back at headquarters.

310
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,848
I'm to give you a ride.

311
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,218
Kiyomi!

312
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,620
Thanks, I'm so grateful.

313
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,121
Hey, wait!

314
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,488
Oh, yes, I'll write up your traffic violation
and send it to you later.

315
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,053
You really are the conscientious one.

316
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,697
Please drive safely on your way home.

317
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,702
I can't stand it anymore!

318
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:32,680
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

319
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:37,155
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

320
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,886
You skip dinner and eat diet food

321
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:48,025
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

322
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,437
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

323
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,770
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

324
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:02,875
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

325
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:11,953
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

326
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,859
Don't you, don't you know

327
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:20,232
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

328
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:28,071
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

329
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:33,970
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

330
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:43,388
A princess is supposed to be pretty.
No way am I babysitting her.

331
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,523
Hey, watch your mouth!

332
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,993
Let Kaori handle the princess, and
I'll go out with Ms. Salina.

333
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,163
I don't think so. Also, if you meddle
with her without preparing...

334
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,428
What the hell is this aura?
My mokkori doesn't work on it!

335
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,302
See! It's a secret aura.

336
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,637
City Hunter 2:

337
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,506
"Mokkori Killer?
The Princess's Noble Aura (Part 1)"

338
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,474
If you don't watch it, you're going
to be sentenced to death.

339
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,768
Please look forward to the next episode
