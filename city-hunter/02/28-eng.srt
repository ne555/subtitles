Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,795

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:29,645
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,664
My brother smuggled drugs?

14
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,865
It's a lie, right, Ryo?

15
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:39,999
Say something!

16
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,668
Why won't you say anything?!

17
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,670
Because I believe in him.

18
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,474
Makimura would not sell his soul to evil.

19
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,672
But Nelson from ICPO and
Saeko distrust him.

20
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,013
On top of that, we were attacked
by Red Pegasus,

21
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,015
which should have been ruined by Ryo.

22
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,575
Did my brother really smuggle drugs?


23
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,620
Makimura...

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,111
What were you trying to do?

25
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:08,616
Message from Makimura
Memories Forever
(Part 2)

26
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,376
You didn't do much even though you
talked big, did you, Gilmore?

27
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,853
Everything was fine until Falcon
showed up and destroyed it.

28
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,557
Forget that, I want to know if your
information is right or not.

29
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:43,763
If Makimura died without leaving anything,
we've been wasting our time.

30
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,365
Don't worry.

31
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,768
The information on the smuggling
route in Asia exists.

32
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,465
Makimura had snuck into the route
in order to investigate the route.

33
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,377
Based on my instructions.

34
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,482
After we get that information, Red Pegasus
will be at the top of the underworld.

35
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,015
And you can get some sweet juice from it.

36
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,892
That's as it should be, isn't it?

37
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:16,429
You haven't forgotten who helped you
re-establish Red Pegasus

38
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,897
after it was ruined by Saeba, have you?

39
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,534
I know that.

40
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,162
I don't want Interpol to be my enemy.

41
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,779
Thank you for the information.

42
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,847
It was a piece of cake.

43
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,749
By the way,

44
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,886
do you have a connection with the
immigration Office at the Ministry of Justice?

45
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:45,085
Well, I know one executive who is
easy for me to deceive...

46
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,061
You are indeed my sister.

47
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,187
I have faith in you.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
Silly you.

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,223
It's a technique to be a detective.

50
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,635
Reika, what are you planning to do?

51
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,602
I'm sorry but I can't tell you anything
about my client's secrets.

52
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,869
You are a troublesome sister.


53
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,184
We were attacked by Red Pegasus and...

54
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,780
You, even though you helped us,

55
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,416
how can you eat like that
without any hesitation?

56
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,717
I see.

57
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,810
You helped us, Umibozu.

58
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,920
Thank you.

59
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,094
You don't need to thank me.

60
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,688
I owed your brother from before.

61
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,961
You owed my brother?

62
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:06,304
It happened when he was still a detective.

63
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,661
Jerk, where did he go?

64
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,029
I'm sure he is around here somewhere.

65
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,731
Search for him thoroughly in this area.

66
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,198
Yes, Sir.

67
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,203
I guess I need specially ordered
handcuffs for you.

68
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,601
Leave things to me.

69
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,041
Why are you letting me go?

70
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,050
You've cleaned out the trash in the city.

71
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,087
That's it, isn't it?

72
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,455
Hey, this way!

73
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,356
Someone's here.

74
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,191
Search this place from one end to the other.

75
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,488
Don't let him go!

76
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,291
That was the first time I met Makimura.

77
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,566
I see.

78
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,036
I didn't know about the incident at all.

79
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,367
I'll get it.

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,307
Hello.

81
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,277
I understand.

82
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,348
Who was that?

83
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,716
Oh, nothing.

84
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,951
Wrong number.

85
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,121
Well, I still don't feel good,
so I'm going back to bed.

86
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,180
Sure, get enough rest.

87
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,639
What is the secret?

88
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,141
Get in the car.

89
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,631
I can't tell you here.

90
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,182
What?

91
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,581
Kaori?

92
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,259
Here you go, Ryo. This is what you wanted.

93
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,295
Thank you, Reika.

94
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,165
But you have to pay me for this.

95
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,434
As I thought...

96
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey, Ryo, how about going out with me now?

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,274
I guess Kaori is out so...

98
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,408
What?!

99
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,142
Oh, no!

100
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,211
Reika, give this to Saeko.

101
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,338
Tell her to look at the date Makimura died.

102
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,982
Ryo! What about the date?

103
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,006
Damn!

104
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,557
Is it okay for you?

105
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,292
What a small car!

106
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,453
I can't stay like this for a long time.
Hurry up and go!

107
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,805
Well, what story do you want to tell me?

108
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,775
I want you to tell me the truth.

109
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,872
What do you want to know?

110
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,043
The stuff that Makimura left.

111
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,451
I told you I don't know.

112
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,884
I'm going to go home if you
say things like that.

113
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,186
I got some information from
Interpol a little while ago.

114
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,395
It seems that Makimura infiltrated
the organization

115
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,887
and bought drugs in order to
expose the smuggling route.

116
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,229
To expose the smuggling route?

117
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,440
Even though he quit being a detective,
his soul as a professional officer lived on.

118
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,409
This improves my opinion of Makimura.

119
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,112
If it's true, I would be happy.

120
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,780
Therefore, it's not necessary for you

121
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,214
to keep the location of the drugs secret
in order to protect your brother.

122
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,243
But I really don't know anything about it.

123
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,815
You really don't know about it or
are you just trying to fool me?

124
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,733
What is this?

125
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,234
A New Year's card.

126
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,236
I didn't know I had it with me.

127
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,604
New Year's card?

128
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,505
Yes...

129
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,207
I didn't know about it,

130
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,437
but it was from the orphanage my brother
used to visit to console children.

131
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,077
Visit?

132
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,544
Orphanage?

133
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,838
I see. He visited to console them. It sounds
like something Makimura would do.

134
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,219
Well, do you know where this orphanage is?

135
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,086
Yes...

136
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,077
It's in Koufuku Misaki close to Yokohama.

137
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,628
What are you doing?! Let me go!

138
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,534
That's her! There!

139
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,970
Damn!

140
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,589
Kaori!

141
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,216
Ryo!

142
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,026
Saeba, you are late.

143
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,391
Ryo!

144
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,403
Kaori!

145
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,345
Where are you taking me?

146
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,452
You had better be good until we arrive
at the Kurumi House.

147
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,523
Kurumi House?

148
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,990
Why are we going to a place like that?

149
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,794
Mr. Gilmore, Saeba is chasing us.

150
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,419
What?

151
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,440
If you think you can follow us,
give it your best shot.

152
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,257
A tiny gun like that won't hurt me at all.

153
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,300
Get out of my way!

154
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,649
Goodbye, Saeba and Falcon!

155
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,617
Ready, Ryo?

156
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,955
What the hell?!

157
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,341
Damn, Saeba!

158
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,878
Saeba!

159
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,158
Are you ready, Saeba?

160
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,854
I will avenge my followers.

161
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,465
Damn!

162
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,548
Damn!

163
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,547
Die, Saeba!

164
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,858
I can't believe I hit him.

165
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,061
Thank you.

166
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,688
You saved me.

167
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,962
Oh, no, I can't believe you're
appreciating me.

168
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,470
Oh, no! Jump!

169
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,956
You look cold.

170
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,391
It feels good.

171
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,450
Why don't you go back home?

172
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,630
I hear something!

173
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,636
Hey, Kaori, where are you going?

174
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,968
I hear that song my brother loved.

175
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,642
Makimura?

176
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,044
Can you hear?

177
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,944
Unfortunately, my hearing is not good.

178
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,856
Kurumi
House

179
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,861
Kurumi House?

180
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,560
Kurumi House is the orphanage
my brother used to visit!

181
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,468
Let's go back.

182
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,902
No, I'll do this for a while.

183
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,306
You'll be punished by the principal.

184
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,773
I don't care.

185
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,711
What are you doing?

186
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,145
Can't you tell?

187
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,635
Who are you?

188
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,886
Well, I am Makimura's younger sister.

189
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
Mr. Makimura's sister?!

190
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,289
Really?

191
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,156
But why is Mr. Makimura not here?

192
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,497
Well, he is busy, so...

193
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,033
By the way, what are you doing here?

194
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,834
Every time Mr. Makimura was here,
he threw away the white sand.

195
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:10,608
I thought if I did this, he might
come to see us.

196
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,613
You like him very much, don't you?

197
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,748
Of course!

198
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,051
Can you take me to your principal?

199
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,040
Yes, sure.

200
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,818
Principal!

201
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,124
White sand...

202
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,759
They were drugs, weren't they?

203
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,494
Makimura's purpose was to
get the information

204
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,462
about the route for smuggling drugs.

205
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,666
He infiltrated the organization in order
to get the information,

206
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,168
and threw away the drugs when he got them

207
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,136
in order to prevent them going to market.

208
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,644
Mr. Makimura was a busy detective

209
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,638
so I didn't want to bother him
by sending him things.

210
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,880
But my children insisted on sending
him a New Year's card, so...

211
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,815
I didn't know he passed away last year.

212
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:05,322
Then I have to return to you
what he entrusted to me.

213
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,531
Entrusted?

214
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,503
Now I know that he came here
right before he died.

215
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:20,209
He told me this was his favorite record
and gave it to my children.

216
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:25,082
He was very happy playing with
the children that day.

217
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,211
And right before he went home...

218
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:32,387
Principal, would you please keep
this for a while for me?

219
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,894
When he didn't come back to get it,

220
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,830
I thought it was because he was busy.

221
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,869
I can't believe he died that day.

222
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,672
This is what he gave to me.

223
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,942
Please take it.

224
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,246
I'm sure that he predicted his fate.

225
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,330
Ryo, I found it!

226
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,298
This is the information that my brother left.

227
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,070
Mr. Nelson...

228
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,406
Give it to me.

229
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,636
Now Makimura can prove himself not guilty.

230
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:23,976
Kaori!

231
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,012
Makimura gathered that information
by risking his life.

232
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,572
Don't give it to trash like him.

233
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,883
What do you mean, Mr. Saeba?

234
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,450
Reika and Saeko?

235
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,163
Let me ask you something then.

236
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,166
Why was the person who heard of
Makimura's death in New York

237
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,794
actually in Japan on that day?

238
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,473
I'd heard of Makimura's sudden
death in New York.

239
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,135
I was shocked.

240
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:02,915
Also, you left Japan on the last flight of the
day, as if you ran away from something.

241
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,578
Your destination was not New York.
You went to Hong Kong, didn't you?

242
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,553
We investigated your immigration record.

243
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,753
Can you explain this to us, Mr. Nelson?

244
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,264
I guess I talked too much and put
myself in a bind, didn't I?

245
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,966
Kaori!

246
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,274
Okay, I'm going to tell you.

247
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,210
On that day when Makimura died,

248
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:37,080
I was in Japan, actually I was
in Tokyo, at the Silky Club.

249
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,022
I don't intend to sell my soul to evil.

250
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,922
Evil is inferior to a rat.

251
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,733
I was the one who asked Makimura
to gather the information

252
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,861
on the drug smuggling route in Asia.

253
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,565
I lied to him when I told him it was
requested by Interpol.

254
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,500
Makimura, who hated drugs, accepted
my request without any hesitation.

255
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,716
When he was almost finished
with the project,

256
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:15,517
the idiots from Red Pegasus killed Makimura
without knowing what he had been doing.

257
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,258
Because of those fools, my plan
was ruined big time.

258
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,228
On top of that, Red Pegasus
was ruined by you,

259
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,526
so I've been working hard to
re-establish the plan.

260
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,429
The new leader of Red Pegasus is such a
fool, worse than the previous leader.

261
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:36,164
I couldn't believe he challenged Ryo Saeba,
the City Hunter, to a fair fight.

262
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,845
However, after I got this,

263
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:44,976
I intended to kill that brainless fool
so I saved some time to do so.

264
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,320
You saved some time to do what?

265
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,787
Gilmore, you're alive?!

266
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:01,099
Jerk, you used me as much as you could.

267
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,566
I won't forgive you!

268
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,073
Fool!

269
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,074
Give it back to me!

270
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:09,870
Bitch!

271
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,981
Damn!

272
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,786
Wait! I won't let you go!

273
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,482
Damn, let me go! I said, let me go!

274
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,313
I'm going to take you to Hell with me!

275
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,688
Stop it, Gilmore!

276
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,657
Stop it!

277
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,422
Saeko, here.

278
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,329
Thank you.

279
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,129
We can stop almost all drugs being
smuggled into Japan with this information.

280
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,494
Brother, you guided me to this place.

281
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,326
Makimura...

282
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:40,664
I have to keep my promise to you,
and tell the truth to Kaori now.

283
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,495
Hey, Ryo.

284
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,738
For me, my brother is my brother.

285
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,107
He is nothing more than that,
or less than that.

286
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,098
Kaori, are you...

287
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,447
That's all. Right, Ryo?

288
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,919
I guess.

289
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,121
Let's go!

290
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:33,240
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,723

Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no

Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa

298
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,426
Don't you, don't you know

299
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:20,799
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

300

302
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,385
Find a missing person? I won't do it.


303
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,087
Something is wrong with Maiko's heart.

304
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,257
But she insists she won't have surgery
unless she finds the person.

305
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,825
Can you abandon an innocent girl?

306
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,593
A female under eighteen years old?
I'm going to pass.

307
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,163
Maiko will be eighteen years old
two years from now.

308
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:51,963
That's right.

309
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,899
See, why don't you help her find him?

310
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,066
Just two more years.

311
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,435
Then, let me handle this.

312
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,303
Did I make him too excited?

313
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,504
City Hunter 2:

314
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,641
"Wounded Innocence!
A Bullet and an Angel's Prayer"

315
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,268
If you don't watch it, you'll have surgery.

316
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:08,345
Please look forward to the next episode
