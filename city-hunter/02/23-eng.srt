1
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,351
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,919
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:40,407
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,673
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,475
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,378
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,728
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,461
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,664
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,136
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:28,847
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,364
Who is Yoko Fuyuno?

13
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,266
She is a news photographer.

14
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,469
She wants to take a picture of City Hunter

15
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,438
and announce to the public that he is
a person of justice and truth.

16
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,175
If she does that, your face
will become known

17
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,910
to everyone in Japan and you'll
be unable to work!

18
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,980
That's why I pretended I was Ryo Saeba's
younger brother Ryoji,

19
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,882
and tried to hide the truth from her.

20
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,686
Even so, did you really need to
dress up as a woman?

21
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,154
I had no choice!

22
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,851
It just happened as a matter of course
while I was fulfilling Saeko's request!

23
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:11,753
The Target is Ryo!
The Camerawoman Loves Danger (Part 2)

24
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,169
What the hell do you want this
early in the morning?

25
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,304
What's going on?

26
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,572
Read this article.

27
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,199
It's about the accident last night.

28
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,639
That truck was loaded with drugs?

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,914
Oh, I am so sorry, Yoko.

30
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,644
You missed a chance to get the scoop
even though you were at the scene.

31
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,252
Don't pretend you don't know.

32
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,321
The tire of that truck was deliberately
shot by someone.

33
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,084
Right in front of the police station too!

34
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,828
I am sure that it was the work
of your brother, Ryo Saeba.

35
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,959
He was asked to destroy this organization,
and make sure that the drugs were found.

36
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,136
It's his way indeed.

37
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,594
You were there to help him, weren't you?

38
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,880
What? She moved out?

39
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,950
I wonder if she finally gave up
on that interview?

40
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,685
No way.

41
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,887
I guess she went to the site where
the accident happened.

42
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,055
Do you think it's okay?

43
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,156
No problem.

44
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,920
I would never do anything silly like
leaving evidence at the site.

45
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,734
I guess I wasted my time after all.

46
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,498
The truck has been moved and
there is nothing left here.

47
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,237
I doubt there were any witnesses to the
accident since it happened late at night.

48
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,709
That woman?

49
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,944
Yes, that's her.

50
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,641
Good, let's get her and make her
come with us.

51
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,587
Be quiet.

52
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,490
You are a very important hostage until
I make him come here and I kill him.

53
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,892
Who?

54
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,560
Look at my nose!

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,629
He did this to me that night.

56
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,964
That night...

57
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,727
Ryo Saeba did it?

58
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,568
Now tell me, where is he?

59
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,103
I don't know.

60
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,537
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,874
What a brave woman!

62
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,245
I have an idea.

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,679
Ryo Saeba wouldn't lose
against these people.

64
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,208
That means this might be my
best chance to see him.

65
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,447
Now tell me, where is he?

66
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,327
All right, I'll give you a number to call.

67
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,659
Then he'll know what is happening here.

68
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,099
What the hell?

69
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,197
Ryo!

70
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,843
Why the hell do you need to be so loud?

71
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,711
Yoko was kidnapped by the guys
who are on the phone.

72
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,408
Who the hell are you?

73
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,814
That voice!

74
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,424
I didn't know it was you.

75
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,324
It's good to shorten the process.

76
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,962
You can't say you don't remember me.

77
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,232
You took very good care of us
at the park that night.

78
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,067
Oh, you're one of the poor guys

79
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,864
who don't have anything to put on
except old fatigues, aren't you?

80
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,571
This uniform symbolizes our policy.

81
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,040
We are not poor.

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,111
We are a violent biker group platoon!

83
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,314
Congratulations! You've been in
the show since last week,

84
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,282
and now you're finally able
to introduce yourself!

85
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,383
Stop fooling around.

86
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,319
Don't you care what will happen
to the woman?

87
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,287
Yoko is fine, isn't she?

88
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,120
Yes, she's locked up in a different room.

89
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:30,919
I'll let you hear her voice,
which is shaking from fear.

90
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,868
Yahoo, how are you Ryoji?

91
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,204
I was captured by these men.

92
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,507
These people need to see your brother Ryo.

93
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,243
Please contact him and ask him to
rescue me as soon as possible.

94
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,870
Thank you and bye!

95
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,973
What the hell is this recording?!

96
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,316
She's weird and kind of high.

97
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:55,421
Anyway, if you want to get her back, come to
the Snack Pentagon in 3-Chome, Shinjuku.

98
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,388
Understand?

99
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,592
It's done.

100
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:04,256
Excuse me, Boss, but do you really think it's
possible for us to win against that guy?

101
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:14,640
This is Raiou, one of my soldiers.

102
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,711
He used to be a pro-wrestler, but he killed
another wrestler in the ring and had to retire.

103
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,112
I don't care who he is, but he can't
match us professional yakuza.

104
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,084
He doesn't know that my father

105
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,110
is the chairman of the Kanto
Unryu Kai yakuza group.

106
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,158
Indeed, she's a troublesome woman.

107
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,060
Are you okay going there by yourself?
Should I go with you?

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,130
No, why don't you stay here
and prepare dinner?

109
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,597
I'll be back shortly.

110
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,010
Finally, I will be able to see him, Ryo Saeba.

111
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,705
Hurry up and rescue me!

112
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,150
What was that?

113
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,708
I thought the door just opened.

114
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,519
Your ass is so cute!

115
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,223
Who are you?!

116
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,692
Hi, I am Ryoji Saeba.

117
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,162
Mr. Saeba, how did you get in here?

118
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,764
I snuck in while they were off guard.

119
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,865
Why did you come here?

120
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,561
I came here to rescue you of course.

121
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,204
You came here by yourself, alone?

122
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,367
Yes, I came here with all my strength for you.

123
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,368
Do you have a better opinion of me now?

124
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,372
Leave me alone!

125
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,383
Where is your brother? Where is Ryo Saeba?

126
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,748
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,923
I didn't think it was worth bothering
my brother, so I didn't tell him.

128
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,792
Come on! Let's escape from
here before they find us.

129
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,693
No, I won't go anywhere until
he comes to rescue me.

130
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,065
On top of that, if a pervert like you helps me,

131
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,034
I'll feel I have to pay you back, and
I don't want to think what you'd ask.

132
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,005
Excuse me, but do you realize what
kind of situation you're in?

133
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,510
Stop it!

134
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,480
Go home or I'll scream louder!

135
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,038
Stop, hey, Yoko!
Don't bother me!

136
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,253
Can't you understand?

137
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,223
You're already in a dangerous situation
since you tried to see him.

138
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,591
If you put your nose more into
the matter of City Hunter,

139
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,922
can you imagine what's going
to happen to you?

140
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,832
I am sick and tired of your threats.

141
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,234
I don't care what happens to me.

142
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,725
If I need to, I will give my life to see him.

143
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,673
I understand.

144
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,675
If you say so, then you may wait.

145
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,576
However, I want you to know that
you might regret it later.

146
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,479
I won't!

147
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,451
Oh, well.

148
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,943
I guess I have to wake her up even
though it's going to be tough for her.

149
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,158
Damn, this is such a waste of time.

150
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,171
Listen, I'll come to rescue
her again in an hour.

151
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,571
Again?

152
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:08,080
Next time, I'd like to have a better welcome
than this stupid big man.

153
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,014
Understand, Mr. Boss?

154
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,677
You, idiot!

155
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:20,126
Raiou, you were there and
what happened?!

156
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,328
You couldn't handle just
one man, could you?

157
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,397
You're too sloppy and I can't accept that.

158
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,199
In this situation, I can't keep quiet
and just watch what's going on.

159
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,735
Leave the man to me!

160
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,270
I am sorry, Father.

161
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,006
However, he made a fool of me big time
and if I ask you to handle this,

162
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,442
as the leader of my group,
I'll lose too much face.

163
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,206
You can just help me by giving me
the tools, can't you?

164
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,449
Indeed, you are my son and the
next chairman of Unryu Kai.

165
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,576
Sure, I'll help you. Do whatever you want to.

166
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,557
Damn, the person who's coming to
rescue you might be killed,

167
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,559
but you're busy taking care of your camera?

168
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,787
What a simple soul you are!

169
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,664
Well, do you really think
you'll win against him?

170
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,722
You're the simple soul.

171
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,567
Shut up and walk faster!

172
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,034
Ouch, it hurts.

173
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,541
This man...

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,476
I've seen his picture.

175
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,410
He must be a yakuza.

176
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,447
You seem to know my father.

177
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,575
He's why I can get tools like this.

178
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,255
I guess you can take a picture
of his corpse after he dies.

179
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,509
It's impossible for him to win,
even though he is City Hunter.

180
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,477
To win against so many guys with guns...

181
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,310
I should have escaped when
Ryoji came to rescue me.

182
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,235
One, sipping blood of people...

183
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:13,172
Two, evil things you have done...

184
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,509
Three, ugly evils in society...

185
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,943
I will clean them up!

186
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,504
What the hell?

187
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,707
Peach Boy who was born from
a giant peach!

188
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,321
Stop fooling around!

189
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,982
What the hell is with that ridiculous mask?!

190
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,152
If you don't like this...

191
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,457
How about this one?

192
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,830
Are you sure that you were beaten
by a man like that?

193
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,860
How can I explain...

194
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,853
Well, it's about time to return
that woman to me now.

195
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,694
Wow, I didn't know you had such a thing.

196
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,596
However, even if it's not a toy,

197
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,996
do you think you'll be able to win
against such a large number of guys?

198
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,302
Same to you.

199
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:20,398
After I make my first step toward you,
nobody will be able to stop me.

200
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,309
Shut up, you won't be able
to make the second step.

201
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,504
Your first step will lead you to Hell!

202
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,352
Stop! Please run!

203
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,317
Fire!

204
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,264
No!

205
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,231
Die!

206
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,311
Six people were shot in a moment.

207
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,608
He is fast!

208
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,550
Don't hesitate!

209
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,882
His gun doesn't have any bullets left. Fire!

210
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,914
No way! He's getting the gun
I dropped when he shot!

211
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,333
Impossible!

212
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,754
Stop, if you come closer,
I will kill this woman.

213
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,312
Can't you see this gun?

214
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,193
No, I can't see it.

215
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,021
Wait!

216
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,251
Father, please help me.

217
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,205
Your skill, and your colt bison...

218
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,341
Even though you hide your face,
I know who you are.

219
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,433
You are...

220
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,444
What's the matter with you, Father?

221
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,173
How can you surrender to a guy like this?

222
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,248
Idiot!

223
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,582
Comparing me and this gentleman,

224
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,311
I am lower than the lowest follower.

225
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,486
Please forgive us.

226
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,181
I'm going to talk to my son and
make him understand.

227
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,389
Chairman!

228
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,923
Yes?

229
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,225
Your way of educating your son
is wrong, I guess.

230
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,627
Yes, Sir!

231
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,494
Please forgive us for now, please.

232
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,933
Now, we have to get going.

233
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,235
Father, what the hell is going on?

234
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,203
Shut up!

235
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,671
You just stay out of it.

236
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,138
Hurry up and get in the car!

237
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,155
What's wrong?

238
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,555
You wanted to take a picture
of me, didn't you?

239
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,823
It's okay, so come this way
and take your camera.

240
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,028
I was stupid.

241
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:43,805
I've been thinking about the underworld as
if it's just like a TV show or a movie.

242
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,669
I've been in love with a fictional character.

243
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:54,186
But finally, I was actually able to experience
the world you belong to,

244
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,155
and I understand my mistake.

245
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,687
There is no room in this world
for my childish feelings.

246
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,755
I understand I shouldn't put
my nose into this world.

247
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,867
Thank you.

248
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:12,735
And I am so sorry, Mr. Saeba.

249
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,141
Goodbye, City Hunter.

250
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,883
Yoko, you forgot this, your camera.

251
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,190
I thought I would be able to take
your picture with that camera,

252
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,125
but I give it to you to remember me by.

253
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,558
Yoko!

254
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,737
The City Hunter is...

255
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,112
It's me!

256
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,217
No way!

257
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,684
This is a nightmare!

258
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,924
Just as I thought.

259
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,586
Since you were late, I came to check.

260
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,797
What? What happened?

261
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,321
Why is Yoko unconscious?

262
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,624
She found out what's going on, I guess.

263
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,072
That's why she fainted, because
she got a shock.

264
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,474
Somehow, we have to keep Yoko
silent about this matter.

265
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,203
Then how?

266
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,270
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

267
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,014
She's so cute.

268
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,108
Well, her mouth is cute and I can close
it with my mouth to keep her silent.

269
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,120
Very funny...

270
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,318
Yes, when you enjoy jokes like that,
you might come up with a good idea.

271
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,833
Anyway, in reality, if she writes an article
about me, her life will be in danger.

272
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,099
In order to keep it from happening, I want
to keep her in the deep mountains.

273
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,693
Ryo...

274
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,275
Of course, I will be with her.

275
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,870
We'll live just the two of us and
kissing all day to keep her silent.

276
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,451
Forbidden
It's just a joke. I'm trying to change
the mood to get some good ideas.

277
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,885
Forbidden
I am changing the mood by doing this.

278
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,791
Wow, Yoko is awake!

279
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,625
Where am I?

280
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,928
You fainted and have been
unconscious until now.

281
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,062
Fainted?

282
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,330
Oh, right.

283
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,934
I was rescued by him, City Hunter, and...

284
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,501
Mr. Saeba?

285
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,336
Yes, Ma'am. What is it?

286
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,539
I guess I'm finally awake.

287
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,808
I'll quit trying to get information
about City Hunter.

288
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,244
I'm sorry to have caused so much
trouble for your brother.

289
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,449
Brother?

290
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,940
Don't you remember anything
before you fainted?

291
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:45,421
No, I only remember that his brother
rescued me, but that's it.

292
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,993
Hey, what's going on here?

293
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,394
I know she found out who
the real City Hunter was.

294
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,235
I think it's a kind of amnesia.

295
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,805
When a human being has experienced
a very strong mental shock,

296
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,341
the brain sometimes buries the memory
deep inside of the mind,

297
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,801
trying to stabilize the mental situation,
to protect the person.

298
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,413
I see.

299
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,316
The fact that you and City Hunter
are the same person

300
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,376
was too much of a shock for her.

301
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
Well, Mr. Saeba, I already
caused many problems,

302
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,521
but can I ask you for one more thing?

303
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,352
Can you go out with me tomorrow night?

304
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,836
I get it, get it, get it!

305
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,077
A date with Yoko, date, date!

306
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:43,248
Shoot! Yoko, why do you want to go out
with a pervert like this guy?

307
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:47,309
Say whatever you want to. She's finally
aware of practical love!

308
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,226
You are so beautiful, Yoko.

309
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,762
Dancing Hall

310
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,797
Dancing Hall
Hi, Ryo.

311
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,197
Dancing Hall
Won't you come to see us dancing today?

312
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,101
You see me and can't you get it?

313
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,436
I'm with this lady on a date today.

314
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,903
No way I can go to a place like that.

315
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,399
Oh, it's okay. Let's go.

316
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,534
Are you sure?

317
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,778
I don't think this town is good for dating.

318
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,879
You're wrong.

319
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,381
I like your hometown.

320
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,542
Cabaret Rabbit

321
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,787
Please don't think about being with me.

322
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:26,417
Act as usual, like you're going out
by yourself and having fun.

323
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,682
Cheers!

324
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,333
Hey, hey, I go to this place pretty
often so let's go in.

325
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,102
No, I told you, the places you go by yourself.

326
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,364
Tsukasa
Sushi

327
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,136
I am sorry to drag you around with me
so long until this time of day.

328
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,077
It's all right.

329
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:51,812
I wanted to know how Mr. Saeba lives in
this city and what your daily life is.

330
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,518
Thank you very much.

331
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,818
One more, the last.

332
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,584
Can we take a picture together?

333
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,760
Just one.

334
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,105
Sure, let's take it.

335
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,403
For the moment of our encounter.

336
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,613
Hey, Ms. Fuyuno. You look very happy.

337
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,747
Don't tell me you found City Hunter?

338
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,956
Here, I realized that he is here, only in here.

339
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,583
See you.

340
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,159
Wow, this is the picture.

341
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:46,038
Oh, but the smile on her face, I don't
think this is for Ryoji Saeba.

342
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,201
She smiles just like this when
she talks about City Hunter.

343
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,678
I wonder if she was not
suffering from amnesia

344
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,670
and she sealed her memory
inside of her heart?

345
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,875
I think I'm right to see her message also.

346
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,819
However, that's his real character anyway.

347
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,163
Hi, cutie, let's go out!

348
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,926
No, go away!

349
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:32,748
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

350
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:37,222
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

351
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,953
You skip dinner and eat diet food

352
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:48,092
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

353
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,504
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

354
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,837
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

355
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:02,942
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

356
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:12,020
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

357
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,925
Don't you, don't you know

358
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:20,298
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

359
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:28,137
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

360
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,037
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

361
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,985
Look, Kaori. That's a ninja!

362
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,787
Is that the one who sent you
a letter of challenge?

363
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,222
Oh, damn. I shouldn't have
passed on the battle

364
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,857
since the ninja is a beautiful
mokkori woman.

365
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,226
I can't let Kaede hear what you said
because she is very serious.

366
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,261
Things happen.

367
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,029
Ryo Saeba, I will accept her challenge.

368
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,932
Kaede, if you lose, you'll quit being a ninja
and become a beauty, won't you?

369
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,700
If you lose, Ryo, what are you going to do?

370
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,701
Are you going to be a ninja?

371
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,903
City Hunter 2:

372
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,807
"The Final Weapon, Sexy Sigh
A Female Ninja Enters the Big City"

373
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,604
If you don't watch it, you'll receive
a letter of challenge.

374
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,711
Please look forward to the next episode
