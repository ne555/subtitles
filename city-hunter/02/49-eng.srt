1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,705
Hey, baby.

14
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,402
Why don't you have a drink with me?

15
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,611
You're my type!

16
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,720
Let's go and have a drink together!

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,621
Oh, well...

18
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,145
Give us that woman!

19
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,258
No way!

20
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,985
I'm first!

21
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,499
So dangerous!

22
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,228
Are you okay?

23
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,651
Am I strong or what?!

24
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:46,087
Goodbye, Hard-Boiled City
(Part 1)

25
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,248
Shoot, he took off his clothes
and left them all over.

26
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,380
I guess Ryo was really drunk
when he came home.

27
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,360
Shoot!

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,624
He scattered his clothes everywhere.

29
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,059
I wish he could control his...

30
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,671
What's this?!

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,342
Pantyhose!

32
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,969
No way!

33
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:32,941
Ryo!

34
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,687
Miki is a pervert.

35
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,593
Mad Angry
Kaori Hammer

36
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,498
Ryo, what's going on?!

37
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,067
What?

38
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,659
What do you mean, what?

39
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,936
What a good night's sleep!

40
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,079
Who are you? Why are you here?

41
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,016
Don't play dumb! I know you
brought her here!

42
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,263
That's it, Ryo! I'm not your partner anymore!

43
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,335
Oh, darn! I don't remember anything.

44
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,603
Who's that girl?

45
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,629
Famous last words. Take responsibility!

46
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,641
Responsibility?

47
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,568
Breakfast is ready.

48
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,548
Do you like miso soup?

49
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,951
Yes, I'm not picky at all.

50
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,418
Good!

51
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,088
Responsibility?

52
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,491
I can't tell her that I don't remember anything.

53
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,551
Well, she's young and cute!

54
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,158
By the way, what's your name?

55
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,801
Did you forget?

56
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,038
What? Oh, no, well, I drank
too much last night, so...

57
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,507
Yoko? Nope.

58
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,941
Asami?

59
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,408
Guess not. Kumiko?

60
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,011
Yumi!

61
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,814
Close, Rumi, Rumi Takahara.

62
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,050
Yes, that's it, Rumi. Rumi!

63
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,917
By the way, do you intend to stay here?

64
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,379
Last night, you asked me to,
didn't you, Mr. Saeba?

65
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,060
Can't I?

66
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,263
Of course, you can stay here forever.

67
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,753
That's good!

68
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,767
Well, Rumi, you were in my bed
last night, weren't you?

69
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,242
I wonder if something happened?

70
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,834
Yes, I enjoyed it very much.

71
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,505
Enjoyed? Does that mean I also enjoyed it?

72
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,054
Why don't I remember anything enjoyable?!

73
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,955
Well, why don't we go back to bed and
do something enjoyable again?

74
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,495
No, after breakfast, cleaning up,
laundry, I have things to do.

75
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,030
I can't play around.

76
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,022
Oh, I see.

77
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,427
I guess it's okay because I'll be able
to enjoy mokkori anytime now.

78
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,339
Jerk, Ryo! He even didn't try to stop me!


79
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:22,041
I'm really going to run away
from home this time!

80
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,812
This man is street vermin, human trash!

81
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,362
Vermin and trash...

82
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:40,500
Yes! I'm the Secretary of Defense,
and I say it, so it's true!

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,593
Then, what do you want me to do about it?

84
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,263
You need me to tell you what I want?

85
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,864
You're a professional, so you understand
what I want, don't you?

86
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,148
No, you shouldn't have moved like that.

87
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,519
Are you all right?

88
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,621
Hurry up and wipe it off or you're
going to catch a cold.

89
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,323
Don't worry, I'm fine.

90
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,194
You did enough cleaning, let's hurry up
and have some fun together!

91
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:45,565
I guess so. The woman who lived here
before cleaned regularly,

92
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,430
so the place is very clean.

93
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,396
Kaori did? Really?

94
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,676
Well, let's have fun.

95
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,770
All right! Let's enjoy mokkori!

96
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,382
Ouch!

97
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,849
Here, put these on.

98
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,087
Why do I need to wear clothes
for having fun?

99
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:12,387
Because you promised me last night to
take me to the amusement park.

100
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,592
Amusement park?

101
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,462
Ryo's an idiot! What does he
like about that girl?!

102
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,461
He'll suffer for the rest of his life!

103
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,236
No! I can't wait! I'm going to make
him pay for this right now!

104
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,561
Did I really have fun last night?

105
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,962
What's wrong?

106
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,232
Well, your face from this direction
looks so cute,

107
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,535
as if you were a pedigreed Siamese cat.

108
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,470
Mr. Saeba, it's as if you're a thoroughbred.

109
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,704
Oh, really?

110
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,604
Sure, but in heat.

111
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,093
Here they are!

112
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,530
Fasten your seatbelt!

113
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,465
Hurry up!

114
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,578
What?!

115
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,045
What the hell?!

116
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,292
Damn!

117
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,720
He entered our blind spot.

118
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,532
What a quick getaway he made!

119
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,597
Anyway, why was the van following him?

120
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,676
It has to be a threat from my dad.

121
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,914
He's doing it because he wants to separate
us and wants me to go back to him.

122
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,417
No way! That was a bazooka and
if there was a mistake, we...

123
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,909
My dad can do things like that. What he
does is usually pretty extreme.

124
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,886
Who the hell is your father?

125
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,861
Kouichiro Takahara, in the Cabinet.

126
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,530
What? You mean the Secretary of Defense?!

127
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,999
Mr. Saeba, please.

128
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,196
Don't let my dad's threats discourage you.
Protect me!

129
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,129
Well, I don't mind, but...

130
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,914
Thank you for the coffee.

131
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,183
Anytime.

132
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,650
Thanks.

133
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,862
No way.

134
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,574
Takahara is here.

135
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,802
Director of Public Safety

136
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,404
We've been waiting for you. Please come in.

137
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,950
Sorry to make you come here, Mr. Takahara.


138
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,942
It's unusual for you to call me up like this.

139
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,580
So, what do you need?

140
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,427
A considerably worrisome incident
has occurred.

141
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:37,997
Ms. Nogami, go ahead.

142
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,464
Yes!

143
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,866
First, please look at this.

144
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,407
What is this?

145
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,272
A ransom note, sent to us this morning.

146
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,746
Ms. Nogami, please read it for us.

147
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,182
Yes! To the Japanese government,

148
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,276
We have set a nuclear bomb
in the center of Tokyo.

149
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,789
By 5 PM tomorrow, transfer one hundred
billion yen to a Swiss account.

150
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,053
From the World Revolution Group,
Black Army.

151
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,927
Black Army?

152
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,264
Yes, it's an international terrorist
gang led by Sarah.

153
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,033
Sarah? A woman?

154
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,969
People say she's a woman, but
nobody really knows who it is.

155
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,598
The only thing we know for sure is that
she's cold-blooded and cruel.

156
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,013
According to the information from
the Public Safety Office,

157
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,783
Sarah and the Black Army followers
have entered Japan already.

158
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,917
I see.

159
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,287
By the way, the letter says the bomb has
already been set. Is that true?

160
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,620
There is no evidence, but it's very possible.


161
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,261
Ms. Nogami, show him the
contents of the box.

162
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,751
Yes!

163
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,229
It was sent to me a little while
ago, a nuclear bomb.

164
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,003
Nuclear bomb?!

165
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,671
Don't worry.

166
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,504
This doesn't contain the plutonium core.

167
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,672
The size is also one-tenth the
actual size of a nuclear bomb.

168
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:05,981
However, the structure itself is the same
as a nuclear bomb with a timer.

169
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,789
You mean, the real bomb with plutonium
is out there somewhere?

170
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,350
Yes, the Black Army would certainly
be able to do something like this.

171
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,284
I'm getting dizzy.

172
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,460
Incredible!

173
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,695
I'm a professional.

174
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,662
Professional?

175
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,763
You knew that, didn't you?

176
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,198
No.

177
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,928
You approached me because you
knew who I was, didn't you?

178
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,735
Who you are?

179
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,094
Are you a professional at this game?

180
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,212
Well, was it really just a coincidence?

181
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,679
Yes, it was a coincidence.

182
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,884
Well, then you really love me, don't you?

183
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,019
Well, I guess...

184
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,988
Good! Then, let's kiss!

185
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,861
No! Stop!

186
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,563
Ouch!

187
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,333
Why? We had fun together in bed, didn't we?

188
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,029
I lied; nothing happened.

189
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,274
I thought so.

190
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,309
I'm so sorry.

191
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,641
It's okay. Anyway, come this way.

192
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,022
Listen, duck in here.

193
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:23,756
What's the matter?

194
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,189
Duck!

195
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,191
You love me so much that you
want to kill me, don't you?

196
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,389
My love is extreme.

197
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,172
Wow! Mokkori thigh!

198
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,367
I love extreme things like this!

199
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,242
Really?

200
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,709
Yes, really.

201
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,243
Ouch!

202
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,641
Yuu Yuu

203
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,855
Too extreme!

204
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:30,651
Wait!

205
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,928
Let me go! Let go!

206
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,429
Mr. Saeba!

207
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,531
No! Help me!

208
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,998
Wait!

209
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,734
Mr. Saeba!

210
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,998
Umibozu and Miki!

211
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,035
You were the ones who fired that
loud-ass bazooka, weren't you?

212
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,044
It's my job.

213
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,511
Let Rumi go.

214
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:54,880
No way.

215
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,840
Her father asked us to protect his
daughter from a beast.

216
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,721
Who the hell is a beast?

217
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,856
You!

218
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,020
Excuse me, but I'm a human being.
Beast means a guy like you.

219
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:13,832
Rumi, he's very dangerous for women
and we can't trust him.

220
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,169
Hey! I haven't done anything to her yet!

221
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,034
What the hell?

222
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,504
I was also told by her father to kill you.

223
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,514
Kill me? You idiot.

224
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,183
If you want to protect her because
you were asked to,

225
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,447
it would be a complete mistake to kill me.

226
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,612
Somebody is trying to get her.

227
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,891
If you want to kill someone, you should
find them.

228
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,324
No way.

229
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,432
Yoo-hoo! Is Ryo home?

230
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,969
What? No one's home?

231
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,371
It's me, Reika. Where are you?

232
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,041
Kaori? Ryo?

233
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,616
Well, I came all the way here with some
good wine.

234
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,083
What?

235
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,522
Yoo-hoo!

236
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,989
Kaori?

237
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:17,529
Good, I brought some good wine so
why don't we have this together?

238
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,996
Where is Ryo?

239
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,097
What? What's wrong, Kaori?

240
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,410
Kaori!

241
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,572
Why did she look at me like that?

242
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,091
Well, I'm going to contact our client.

243
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,558
Thanks.

244
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,831
Hi, I didn't know you were here.

245
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,095
Ryo, what did you do to Kaori?

246
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,868
Kaori? Did she come back here?

247
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,439
She rushed out white-faced a little while ago.

248
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,507
I wonder why?

249
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,841
Hurry up and get in.

250
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,366
Umibozu? Who is she?

251
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,575
Well, she was here when I woke up.

252
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,950
Don't worry. These are my friends.

253
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,113
I see. I guess she's the cause.

254
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,695
No! Something is planted here.

255
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,229
What?

256
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,564
Run outside!

257
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,997
Reika, hurry up!

258
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,450
I guess she's extremely mad at you.

259
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,908
She must be really serious.
Her special weapon is a hammer.

260
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,423
I guess you had better hurry up
and apologize to her, Ryo.

261
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,391
Well, I guess.

262
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,949
Ryo, where is she?

263
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,293
Rumi! Let's go after her!

264
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,961
Wait, I'm going with you.

265
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,369
I came here to talk to you
about some business.

266
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,868
No! Wait for me. Don't leave me!

267
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,680
A nuclear bomb?!

268
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,138
Yes, it looks like the Black Army have
already set it somewhere in Tokyo.

269
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,553
I know that you're familiar
with the underground.

270
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,854
I would like you to investigate this.

271
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,344
The Black Army?

272
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,257
A terrorist group.

273
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,856
The leader is called Sarah,
a mysterious beauty.

274
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,963
A beauty and a terrorist.

275
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,367
Umibozu, she might be one of their targets.

276
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,800
Looks like it.

277
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,932
Who is she?

278
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,569
Beloved daughter of Kouichiro Takahara,
the Secretary of Defense.

279
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,494
Kazuya!

280
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,067
Rumi! I got our tickets to the US.

281
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,503
Tomorrow, we're getting out of Japan!

282
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,970
It's cancelled.

283
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,242
Who are you?

284
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,077
We're on your side.

285
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,046
Currently, Rumi is being
targeted by someone.

286
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,446
She might have seen or heard something
they didn't want anyone to know.

287
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,654
Saeko, don't move!

288
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,821
Ryo!

289
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,423
How quick they are!

290
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,323
I guess they really hate us.

291
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:16,335
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

292
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,032
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

293
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:25,933
But I couldn't do so

294
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:36,446
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

295
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:42,849
You don't know the reason I'm here

296
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:57,776
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

297
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,143
I wouldn't have let you go

298
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:09,418
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

299
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:15,660
Everyday life is starting

300
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:25,936
In my mind, time has stopped

301
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:32,276
And a double-decker bus is passing

302
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,486
Using a nuclear bomb, which has been
set in the center of Tokyo,

303
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,319
the Black Army continues to threaten
the government without mercy.

304
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:48,160
There is no way to avoid a showdown
with the mysterious beauty Sarah.

305
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,562
But I don't want to shoot Sarah.

306
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,587
Sarah is Kaori!

307
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,694
Hurry up and wake up, Kaori!
You're being manipulated!

308
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,303
City Hunter 2:

309
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,295
"Goodbye, Hard-Boiled City (Part 2)"

310
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,503
If you miss it, goodbye.

311
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,834
Please look forward to the next episode
