1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,187
Strange...

13
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,470
Kaori in Danger!
Love Means Saying Goodbye
(Part 1)

14
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,244
You were followed?

15
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,420
For the last two or three days,

16
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,047
I've felt as if someone's been watching me.

17
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,758
Hey, if you've molested some guy

18
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,488
or stolen some underwear,
turn yourself in right now.

19
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,923
Why is it always like that with you?!

20
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:51,804
It just might be some wealthy young heir
who has been following me

21
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,873
afraid to tell me of his love for me.

22
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,276
Sound asleep,
do not disturb.

23
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,510
Sound asleep,
do not disturb.
He's pushing it!

24
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:57,737
He's pushing it!

25
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:03,406
If it's sleep you want, then it's
sleep eternal you'll get!

26
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,448
It was a joke, a joke, just a little joke!

27
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,522
Don't be so angry, Kaori!

28
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,116
You said that stuff with such a
straight face, I couldn't help it.

29
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,254
Yesterday, I heard the click of a shutter too.

30
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,363
I am sure someone's taking photos of me.

31
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,225
Photos, you say.

32
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:27,874
IDOL (UNAUTHORIZED) PHOTOGRAPHS

33
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,477
IDOL (UNAUTHORIZED) PHOTOGRAPHS
What's the idea?! This is a shop that
sells unauthorized idol photos.

34
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,843
IDOL (UNAUTHORIZED) PHOTOGRAPHS
Right, amateur hidden shots.

35
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,981
Take a look right there.

36
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,417
Kaori Makimura - Shinjuku Idol

37
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,686
Did you know you're the most
popular item at this shop?

38
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,355
They say they're selling more of your photos
around here than your average idol's.

39
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,428
I see. I didn't know that.

40
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,363
I'm that popular with the young men?

41
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,301
After all, how could society
ignore such beauty?

42
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:07,103
How about it, Ryo? I'm not such a
slouch after all, right, Ryo?

43
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,949
I'm a little jealous.

44
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,887
Ryo, you mean...

45
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,157
I'm so jealous I don't know what to do!

46
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,682
The ones buying your photo are all girls!

47
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:28,259
Kaori, if any girls start making passes
at you, could you spare me one?

48
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,638
You idiot!

49
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,234
Stupid! Stupid! How stupid!

50
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,012
Kaori!

51
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,188
Kaori!

52
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,193
What was that sound?!
Sounds like something exploded!

53
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,753
Wasn't that a gun?!
You're kidding?!

54
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,098
Ryo!

55
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,895
Kaori! Are you...

56
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,360
My shoe, the heel.

57
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:11,233
Did someone just try to... me?

58
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,814
Kaori, did you fool around with a
yakuza's woman or something?

59
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,686
I never!

60
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,113
Yeah! Yeah! Our first job in a while, Ryo!

61
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:53,019
XYZ: I'll be waiting
in the Sun City
observation lounge
at 8:00 PM this evening.
- Silver

62
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,953
- Silver

63
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:00,960
We're taking this one even if it's a man.
I'll go tonight.

64
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,427
I'll go.

65
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,698
What's this all of a sudden?
That's my job.

66
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,165
Never mind, just go home.

67
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,136
Wait!

68
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,974
Ryo, you've been acting strange
since yesterday.

69
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,465
Usually, you don't even come to
check the board with me.

70
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,781
Could it just be that you are concerned
about me and are trying to protect me?

71
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,750
Don't be silly. Just do what I told you.

72
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,618
Okay.

73
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:46,664
I came anyway! Ryo's always hiding
something when he's like that.

74
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,943
What's wrong with you, Saeba?

75
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,537
A pro letting someone sneak up
behind him so easily.

76
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,280
Don't be so sure.

77
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,820
A stalemate? Good enough then.

78
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,813
That shot yesterday, what was
that about, Silver Fox?

79
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,249
That was my way of saying hello.

80
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,421
I thought we finished our business
the other day.

81
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,061
That wasn't enough to teach you a lesson?

82
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,170
You had that incriminating photo
to hold over my head.

83
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,637
It wasn't a fair fight.

84
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,041
I get it, this time it's a formal challenge.

85
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,343
You get the photo and the
reputation as number one

86
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,810
in the world of professional killers.

87
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,979
That's correct. If you're a pro,
accept my challenge!

88
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,648
Very well, how do you want to do it?

89
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,890
Just killing you outright in a showdown
wouldn't satisfy me.

90
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,949
Let's settle this with an interesting game.

91
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,461
Look!

92
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,827
What? That's a photo of Kaori.

93
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,628
Oh, so you were the one following Kaori.

94
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:54,632
That's right. This woman, your lover,
I'm going to kill her!

95
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,108
My...

96
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,575
...lover?!

97
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:05,117
Lover? I'm Ryo's lover?

98
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,584
Really?!

99
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,944
I will kill this girl within three days.

100
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:15,391
You have to try to stop me!
So, do you like my game?!

101
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,264
Why are you looking at me like that?
You got a problem with it?

102
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,235
Calling her my lover, that's not funny at all!

103
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,210
If you lack the confidence to protect her,
make a formal announcement

104
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,542
of your defeat to the underworld
and get out of town.

105
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,552
That dummy, distorting the facts
to suit himself.

106
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,706
What's going on? Why do I have to end up
being targeted as your lover?

107
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,475
Well...

108
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,310
You are going to protect me,
aren't you, Ryo?

109
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:13,117
But it's my lover he says he's going to kill,
and you're not my lover.

110
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,384
Yes, you're right.

111
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,160
What was that shaking?

112
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,627
Is it an earthquake?!

113
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,798
That says one hundred tons!

114
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,595
It's over capacity then!

115
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:33,163
Think it's necessary to protect someone
stronger than myself?

116
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,449
What are you smiling about
so early in the morning?

117
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,348
All that talk, but there you are
cleaning your guns.

118
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,730
Here!

119
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,265
What are you doing?

120
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,065
I just thought I'd clean your gun since
I was doing mine anyway.

121
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,232
It's your job to protect your own life.

122
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:13,346
You irresponsible loser!
You're the cause of all of this!

123
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,314
Are you my lover?

124
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,542
Well, but...

125
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,091
It's a fact I'm in danger because
he thinks I'm your lover.

126
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,718
Then will you pay me?

127
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,596
Then I could just consider
protecting you another job!

128
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:39,862
Oh, is that so? You are awful!

129
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,544
Will you do mokkori with me?
Become my real lover?

130
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,584
Just kidding.

131
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,290
Come on, you're the only lady friend
I don't do mokkori with!

132
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,967
But I'll give you a chance too, Kaori!

133
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:12,038
If you can succeed in making me feel
mokkori, I'll agree to protect you!

134
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,336
Not that I think it's possible.

135
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,505
Watch it, you idiot!

136
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,545
Perhaps I've committed a terrible
misjudgment here.

137
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,790
Make an idiot of me! You... You...

138
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:44,664
Fine by me! I don't need your help!

139
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:57,280
But my pride as a woman has been offended.
Giving up just galls me!

140
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,509
And me, I have plenty of female charm!

141
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,284
Getting that maniac all mokkori
will be a cinch!

142
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,827
Enter!

143
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,331
Ryo, got a minute?

144
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,798
Sure!

145
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,524
Here I come.

146
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,950
Well? Like it?

147
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,580
Going around like that! Caught a cold,
haven't you? You sound funny.

148
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,456
Dummy!

149
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,784
No big deal. I was under no illusion
it would be that easy anyway.

150
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:51,270
I've started doing aerobics.
I wondered if you'd like to join me?

151
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,229
Look, I'm all sleepy with this spring weather.

152
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,673
Okay, I'll just go ahead myself.
Join me if you feel like it.

153
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,583
Hey, hey! No need to go doing that here!

154
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,886
Come on! Don't be so serious!

155
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,548
But with all this noise...

156
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,204
He's looking, he's looking!

157
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,027
I did it! His mokkori look!

158
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,592
Kaori...

159
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,562
Ryo!

160
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,579
Please forgive me, Kaori.
I've finally realized...

161
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,482
Ryo...

162
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:14,675
...how important aerobics are for you, Kaori.

163
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,623
I'm sorry I was angry.

164
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,389
I had no idea that you had put on so
many pounds around your waist.

165
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,858
Pounds?

166
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,421
I see!

167
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,565
Drop dead!

168
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,868
You good-for-nothing, mokkori man!

169
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,412
I see, I get it! You don't care
what happens to me!

170
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,209
I see, I see! I get it!

171
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:48,621
This is the first time I got struck
like this without the hammer!

172
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,647
But I can't get out!

173
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,564
Why is he letting her walk all alone like that?

174
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,098
Maybe she really isn't his lover. I wonder...

175
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,280
What could I have been thinking?
I feel like an idiot.

176
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,373
Why bother with that loser?

177
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:21,845
He doesn't care about me, much less
consider me his lover.

178
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,226
Almost had a heart attack.

179
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,268
Let's move, quick!

180
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,348
Too late! We won't make it!

181
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,829
My car!

182
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,164
Always acting without thinking.

183
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,339
Still, that position Kaori was in
was pretty erotic somehow.

184
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,350
Hey, what's wrong with me?!

185
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,946
Getting mokkori by seeing Kaori like that!
Strange! Can't be!

186
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,358
Ryo!

187
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,095
Are you here, Ryo?!

188
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,494
Yeah!

189
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,459
Oh, you're here.

190
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,469
Say, Ryo...

191
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,471
What is it?

192
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:59,475
Look, were you here the
whole time I was out?

193
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,348
Of course, I just woke up from my nap.

194
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,955
So it wasn't Ryo.

195
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,499
What's that outfit about?!

196
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,933
Can't you tell? I have a date.

197
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,602
My life's in danger, and you have a date?!

198
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,567
I'm not doing this for the fun of it.
It's for your sake.

199
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:24,977
Mine?

200
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,471
The reason he's after you is that he
has this notion you're my lover.

201
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:35,086
If I ignore you and date other girls,
he'll realize his mistake!

202
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,602
It's obvious if I think about it calmly.

203
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,735
If I'm in danger, I'm certain
he'll come to my aid.

204
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,107
He's just embarrassed to protect me as
his lover. That's why he's doing this.

205
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,081
That date stuff isn't true. He's just patrolling
the area around the house.

206
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,285
Why can't he just be honest?

207
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,877
Hi there! Sorry to make you wait!

208
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,922
Wait long?

209
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,014
No, I just got here.

210
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,723
Shall we go then?

211
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,228
That...

212
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,999
Calm down, calm down.

213
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,068
He's just pretending to go on a date

214
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,162
so he can patrol without tipping off
the Silver Fox.

215
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,718
Thanks, I had fun.

216
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,685
See you later.

217
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,856
Finally going home?

218
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,323
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ryo!

219
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,427
You're right on time! Like to go out to eat?

220
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,951
That sounds great!

221
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:56,201
Calm down, calm down, he can't make
one girl march around all night.

222
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,793
That's why he has another date.

223
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,843
Goodnight, Ryo.

224
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,333
Take care now.

225
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,579
Ryo, hi!

226
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,661
What does that dummy think he's doing?

227
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:28,396
It's very clear to me now that you have
no interest in protecting me!

228
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,604
I'm not playing it calm anymore!
I'll teach him to...

229
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,443
Mr. Saeba? A phone call for you.

230
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,645
Hello, Ryo speaking.

231
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,683
Give it a rest, Saeba! Do you really think
you can deceive me so easily?!

232
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,522
Oh, it's you, Silver Fox.
Use your head, will you?

233
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,624
I'm in the middle of a date right now.

234
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,430
That just tells me how much you
want to shield that girl

235
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,261
who's been following you around.

236
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,235
I have no idea what you're talking about!
I'm hanging up!

237
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,701
Then I'll give you an idea.

238
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,709
Infrared scope!

239
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,142
Kaori! Get down!

240
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,854
Ryo!

241
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,756
Just the scope.

242
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,928
Now you understand!

243
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,496
Next time is for real! You better get ready!

244
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,186
Why the silent treatment?! Are you angry
because I ruined your date?

245
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,225
You're not up to it.

246
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,931
If you're so inept you can't even detect
an infrared beam on your face,

247
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,234
you won't survive in this business.

248
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,898
What are you saying?! I can't match
your highly honed skills!

249
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,063
Makimura wouldn't have made
the same mistake.

250
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:22,405
Ryo, are you telling me not
to be your partner?!

251
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,646
That's not funny at all! If I quit...

252
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,456
Is...

253
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:38,454
Is protecting me so unpleasant for you?!
Is it such a burden for you?!

254
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,866
I see.

255
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:07,453
I see. He's finally gotten serious
about facing me.

256
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:32,715
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

257
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,189
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

258
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,920
You skip dinner and eat diet food

259
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,059
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

260
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,471
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

261
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,804
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

262
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:02,908
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

263
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:11,987
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

264
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,892
Don't you, don't you know

265
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:20,265
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

266
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:28,104
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

267
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:34,004
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

268
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,118
All right, I get the picture crystal clear, Ryo.

269
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,422
Really? Then you'll wash your hands
of the underworld now?

270
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,890
You've got to be kidding me!
I've got my pride too!

271
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,460
Since it's come to this,
I'll get Silver Fox myself!

272
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,228
Hey, what're you thinking, Kaori?

273
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,563
Shut up!

274
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,396
Behold! This is a trap I learned
directly from Umibozu!

275
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,528
Silver Fox has been defeated!

276
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,270
City Hunter 2:

277
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,473
"Kaori's in Danger! Love Means
Saying Goodbye (Part 2)"

278
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,703
You'll get the hammer if you don't watch it.

279
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,744
Please look forward to the next episode
