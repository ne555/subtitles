00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,698
The girl's name is Sakura.

14
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,334
Her brother was threatened by
the Hong Kong Mafia.

15
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,704
He made plates to counterfeit US dollars,
and she's gone missing with them.

16
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,072
I see.

17
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,667
The weapons which those street gang
boys had came from the mafia.

18
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,646
I caught Sakura and put her in handcuffs,
so she couldn't escape from me.

19
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,915
But now, I don't have anywhere to run to.

20
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,218
Umibozu is staring at me holding his gun.

21
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,819
Umibozu?

22
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,820
Why?

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,721
I don't know.

24
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,484
Why don't you ask him directly?

25
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,850
Mokkori Contract!
Strange Journey of Ryo & a Bad Girl
(Part 2)

26
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,670
You are the City Hunter whom
I've heard rumors about.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,228
Your name is very famous.

28
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,941
You, I think I know who you are.

29
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,478
I see. It's my pleasure if you know me.

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,246
No!

31
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,713
I don't know you at all.

32
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,517
He's the branch office manager
of the Hong Kong Mafia.

33
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,184
I guess you like joking around, don't you?

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,998
He told me this couldn't be taken off.

35
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,465
What a mystery!

36
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,368
You, let him go!

37
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,097
Oh, no, I'm just kidding.

38
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,807
Throw him into the basement.

39
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,042
Yes, Sir.

40
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,009
Come!

41
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,640
You've lost your eye for selecting people if
you let yourself be hired by a jerk like him.

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,484
Get a move on!

43
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,917
What kind of a guy is he anyway?

44
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,793
Damn, City Hunter is nothing but
a stupid pervert!

45
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,129
Oh, no, what you just said wakes me up.

46
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,359
Sakura, wait for me. I will be back here
shortly to rescue you.

47
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,667
Station several guards on him.

48
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,793
Yes, Sir.

49
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,870
Such a waste.

50
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,841
Behave yourself for a while.

51
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:39,514
Lady, why don't you cooperate
with us for now?

52
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,389
Even though you have the original plates
for the counterfeit money,

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,357
there's no way for you to
make them valuable.

54
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,560
How about this?

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,930
If you return them to us, we'll give you
whatever you want to have.

56
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,035
Idiot.

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,377
You little rat!

58
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,448
You're bad.

59
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,384
She's a lady even though she doesn't
look like one, so you can't hit her.

60
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,986
You?!

61
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,254
No way...

62
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,314
Now I know that your target is the
original counterfeit plates.

63
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,760
No wonder you got too serious
about this little girl.

64
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,593
Damn! Umibozu, kill him.

65
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,922
Stop drinking! Hurry up and kill him!

66
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,434
If you want to kill him, do it yourself.

67
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,773
You, jerk! Do you forget I'm
the one who hired you?!

68
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,710
The contract between us is for me
to bring that girl to you.

69
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,746
I know I finished it.

70
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,681
Then, I'm gonna hire you again!

71
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,149
I'll pay you as much as you want!

72
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:43,883
Hell no!

73
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:44,851
Why?!

74
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,719
If you are a pro, you're supposed to accept
since I'll pay you, aren't you?

75
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,688
You falsified the contents of your request!

76
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,487
You told me to bring back a runaway girl.


77
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:57,523
I don't accept requests from
a person I can't trust.

78
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,633
You have to find a way by yourself.

79
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,100
He says so.

80
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,362
Well, shall we go home now?

81
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,030
Boss, City Hunter has escaped.

82
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,944
Oh, so you finally found out, did you?

83
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,502
You jerk! How did you do that?!

84
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,077
Watch your step.

85
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,857
I'm not comfortable being in here.

86
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,348
I'm going to go home and drink on my own.

87
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,562
Well, we're going too.

88
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,270
Bastard!

89
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,465
You will pay us back for this!

90
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,045
Here!

91
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,647
Thank you.

92
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,114
Ryo's late, isn't he?

93
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,611
Hey, come in.

94
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,153
Sakura, you're back safe and sound!

95
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,823
I don't appreciate that you worry about me.

96
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,925
Hey, that's not nice.

97
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,293
Anyway, come inside now.

98
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,760
Ouch!

99
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,800
Sakura, Hiromi has really been
worried about you.

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,835
No way.

101
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,326
What that bitch really wants is the
original counterfeit plates.

102
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,502
She tries to earn money by using my brother.

103
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,435
Where did you hide the originals anyway?

104
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,247
Are you also trying to get them?

105
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,215
Not really.

106
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,417
The only thing I'm interested in is mokkori.

107
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,418
Then why did you ask?

108
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:32,058
As long as they exist, you'll be targeted
as well as Hiromi and your brother too,

109
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,061
even if you give the original plates to them.

110
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,497
I got it, in order to seal your lips.

111
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,097
Right.

112
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,861
Then what can they do now?

113
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,831
It's all up to Hiromi.

114
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,665
The request she made of me is to
bring Sakura back to her.

115
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,944
First, I have to get one mokkori from her,
otherwise, I can't accept the second request.

116
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,037
That's what you meant!

117
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,582
I understand.

118
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,518
I'll pay you right now if you want.

119
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,619
Oh, no!

120
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,077
If you do that, you won't be able to
see your fianc

121
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,557
That's okay.

122
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,355
I'm the cause of all this and all the suffering
he has been through is my fault.

123
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,964
Please, Mr. Saeba, I don't care
what happens to me,

124
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,432
but please protect Takao and Sakura.

125
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,542
Well, let's go to my room now.

126
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,102
You're the worst idiot in the world!

127
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,817
Damn! Look what Kaori did to me.

128
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,115
I hate this job. I'm going to quit!

129
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,291
Hiromi, I'm going to take this job.

130
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:38,925
But...

131
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,449
Trust me.

132
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,829
Ms. Sakura?

133
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,296
Wait, Sakura!

134
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,045
Why do you hate Hiromi?

135
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,580
I don't really.

136
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,242
You don't want her to take your brother
away from you, do you?

137
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,216
No!

138
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,890
Brother and sister, you have to
let each other go someday.

139
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,858
It means you've matured.

140
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,728
It's better to mature as quickly as possible.

141
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,195
This is a good chance now.

142
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,769
Sakura...

143
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,874
Damn it!

144
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,274
Hey! Be gentle.

145
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,444
Sakura!

146
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,446
Are you all right, Sakura?

147
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,111
I'm fine.

148
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,978
Well, I guess I'm going to bed.

149
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,424
It was a rare occasion for you
to be cool like that this time.

150
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,982
Well, once in a while.

151
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,391
I'm afraid of his reaction.

152
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,106
Ryo! Where the hell are you going?!

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,144
Geez! What the hell are you doing, Kaori?

154
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,413
That's my line!

155
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,813
You're not going to the guest room, are you?

156
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,417
Exactly!

157
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,816
To get my one promised mokkori.

158
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,454
Damn!

159
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,048
It was a rare thing to happen and now,
look what he does.

160
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,559
Who?

161
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:28,935
That voice!

162
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,402
Hiromi!

163
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,007
Take her with us.

164
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,474
Hurry up!

165
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,846
You! Egami's followers!

166
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,313
Damn!

167
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,117
Let's go.

168
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:45,913
Yes, Sir.

169
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,356
Sakura!

170
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,692
She was kidnapped by Egami's followers!

171
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,159
What?!


172
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,664
Hiromi!

173
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,505
Boss, I captured the woman.

174
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,875
Since we have her, we might be able
to find a better way.

175
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,901
I'm useless to you if you want to
use me for your business.

176
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,714
Is that so?

177
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,274
I think it's worth a try.

178
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,853
That girl thoroughly hates me.

179
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,055
I'm sure she thinks this is a good opportunity
for her to get rid of me.

180
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,323
What the hell?!

181
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,518
I am sorry that I can't go along with your plan.

182
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,861
In that case, I'll kill you.

183
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,943
Are you asking me to hide that girl
I met the other day?

184
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:44,944
No way!

185
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,639
I won't let any woman stay at my place.

186
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,413
Meow...

187
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,310
If you say no, I'll fill this place with cats.

188
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,421
You jerk. Are you trying to frighten me?

189
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,922
I won't ask you to do it for free.

190
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,822
How about sharing the money
for this job fifty-fifty?

191
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,261
It sounds like you're going to be
generous this time.

192
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,196
It means I trust you that much.

193
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,466
Well, thanks.

194
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,934
Oh, Ryo, where are you going?

195
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,334
Oh, yes, I'll be here.

196
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,943
Shinjuku, West Exit
Usando

197
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,001
Ryo?

198
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,212
What's Usando?

199
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,519
Usando

200
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,360
This place looks like it's doing really
good business, doesn't it?

201
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,096
You came all the way down here just to
make innuendos like that?

202
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,860
No, no, I have a favor.

203
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:44,291
How many lives do I need
to do a favor for you?

204
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,604
What?

205
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,007
You told me you would sell
your life for money.

206
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,999
I can't believe what you just told me.

207
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,004
I'm sorry but my life won't
be bargained away.

208
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:01,648
But I know the most about your artistic skill,
which I value more than anyone else.

209
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,888
You know how to butter someone up.

210
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,724
Here.

211
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,264
Wait!

212
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,901
Where are you going?

213
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,670
Shower.

214
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,501
I sweat a lot.

215
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,613
Hey, if you're that worried about me,
why don't we take a shower together?

216
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,914
Ridiculous!

217
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,438
Don't mix me up with Saeba.

218
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,878
Hurry up and get in there!

219
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,591
Wow, Umi-chan is so cute and so shy.

220
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,160
Well, play by yourself with this.

221
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,718
Here, my panties.

222
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,899
Pan...

223
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,599
I did it!

224
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,929
I see...

225
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,572
You're treating me like a stranger.

226
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:30,075
You hide stuff like that without telling me.

227
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,744
You have nothing to do with it.

228
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,412
Oh, you're so wrong.

229
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,881
I've heard it's worth lots of money, isn't it?

230
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,183
Who told you so?

231
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,707
You don't need to care about it.

232
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,485
Gotcha!

233
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,762
Finished.

234
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,543
Indeed, the underworld artist!

235
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,704
It's too late to praise me now.

236
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,444
Okay, I'll get it.

237
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,119
Hello, Usando.

238
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,955
Yes, he is.

239
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,658
It's for you.

240
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,682
It's a woman.

241
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,964
When I found him, he was like this.

242
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,331
Sakura is missing and Umibozu
is unconscious.

243
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,802
Oh, boy.

244
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,904
He became unconscious because
of these panties.

245
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,531
What a rare species he is nowadays!

246
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,298
You're too abnormal.

247
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,613
You're going to have fun by yourself, hey?!

248
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,422
It's all my fault.

249
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,424
I'm going to clean this mess up.

250
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,592
No, you can't.

251
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,891
I won't let you have fun by yourself.

252
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,799
Use whatever you want to.

253
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,434
No, thank you.

254
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,528
I don't flirt with any other guns,
only this one.

255
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,808
What a picky guy!

256
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,742
I only go for pretty faces.

257
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,393
Hey, Sakura is here, isn't she?

258
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,594
I don't know, you idiot.

259
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,595
He has a gun!
Run!

260
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,297
Such ugly guys!

261
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,865
Leave things to me.

262
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,334
If you go, things will become showy.

263
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,603
Don't worry. I'll do it quietly.

264
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,204
Well, be careful.

265
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,839
Don't worry.

266
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,843
I'm not worried about you;
it's the little boys in there.

267
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,140
Don't destroy them.

268
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,558
It's started.

269
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,646
It was really quiet, considering
your usual method.

270
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,519
It's my character.

271
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,253
Then?

272
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,222
They sold her along with the
original plates to Egami.

273
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:44,970
Ouch!

274
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,372
Don't touch me!

275
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,940
Sakura, why?

276
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,434
She went to pick up the original plates so
she could help you, and she was caught.

277
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,814
Sakura!

278
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,805
What a beautiful sister-in-laws-to-be love.

279
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,543
Don't worry. I'll let you sink to the
bottom of the sea together.

280
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,201
City Hunter and Umibozu...

281
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,570
Shoot them! Shoot them down!

282
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,679
Let me handle this.

283
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,408
Don't hesitate to be showy now.

284
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,706
Difficult request.

285
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,510
Take me to where the ladies are.

286
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,272
Throw the gun away and come down slowly.

287
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,974
I will.

288
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,913
You deal with things trusting in
your own skill.

289
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,915
A person like you is just an amateur after all.

290
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,217
I don't know about that.

291
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,419
Well, shall I show you the
professional technique?

292
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,114
I don't think there is time for that.

293
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,988
Hurry up and throw the gun away.

294
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,528
Die!

295
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,369
You were lucky because you had a chance
to see the professional technique.

296
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:11,180
I don't want to let you live, but I don't want
the ladies to see such a cruel scene.

297
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,053
Thank you very much, Mr. Saeba.

298
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,561
Sakura...

299
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,530
Sister...

300
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,938
Well, shall we go?

301
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,141
What a pushover.

302
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,391
You should have killed him.

303
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,622
I'm not a pushover who'll let him die quickly.

304
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,622
It was hard work to create
the elaborate plates.

305
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,089
Good job.

306
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,595
It's sad that the branches in Japan
were all ruined though.

307
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,790
But I think it's worth it.

308
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,610
What the hell?!

309
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,306
Damn you, are you trying to make me laugh?

310
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,448
What the hell?!

311
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,563
Oh! It's Mr. Saeba and Umi-chan!

312
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,099
Sister, I'm going to go and say hello to them.

313
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,007
Mr. Saeba! Umi-chan!

314
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,239
Umi-chan, she says?

315
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,286
Thank you for coming.

316
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,084
Tell your sister congratulations.

317
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,225
Excuse me...

318
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,455
Can I substitute for her to pay you back?

319
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,364
Sure!

320
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:43,391
But when the time comes, when you'll be
able to love someone in a mature way.

321
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,874
Promise.

322
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,041
How long do you intend to keep living
in that fantasy world?

323
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,976
Don't get jealous.

324
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,021
Anyway, where is my money?

325
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,023
Oh, shall I give it to you now?

326
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:05,857
You have it already?

327
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:06,824
Well...

328
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,395
What the hell are you thinking?

329
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,664
Half of the kiss as the reward for you.

330
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,532
I don't want it!

331
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,166
Take it!

332
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,033
I don't want it!

333
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,001
I don't have any interests in that direction.

334
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,171
Hey!

335
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:33,149

00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,621
You don't need one, Kaori.

349
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,055
It's not for me.

350
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,590
This is a job request from Ms. Emi.

351
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,159
She said she's going to travel overseas.

352
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,363
That's such a lie. It's training
to rescue her father.

353
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,231
Does she intend to rescue him all by herself?

354
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,435
Don't worry. I will train her with
my mokkori special.

355
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,036
You don't use mokkori in this case.

356
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,237
City Hunter 2:
