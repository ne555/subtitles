1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,440
When I'm alone, I'm watching
the city all the time.

14
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,782
There are so many things which
stimulate my imagination

15
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,272
and it's so much fun.

16
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,261
Incredible!

17
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,009
Wow!

18
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,725
No way,

19
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,021
I don't think he recognized me.

20
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,631
But if he knows that I'm watching him...

21
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,148
He's not there today.

22
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:23,091
Wanting to Fall in Love Just Like a Dream
The Strategy of a Twelve Year Old Angel
(Part 1)

23
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,440
Today's almost over without anything
happening, just like every day.

24
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,808
Another page of valuable youth
is wasted and floating away.

25
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,849
But the person whose youth is already
gone looks happy anyway.

26
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,478
I did it! 30,000 points over! A new record!

27
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,922
I'm a genius, just as I thought.

28
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,550
Even in a game, I hit the mark
ten times out of ten!

29
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,253
I don't even want to get mad at him anymore.

30
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:55,133
A sweeper who slacks off and plays
video games all day is just useless.

31
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,104
That light again.

32
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,109
Hey, Ryo, do you know what that light is?

33
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,737
Don't talk to me now!

34
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,815
I first saw it about a week ago.

35
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,117
Something shines there everyday at this time.

36
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,584
Over there, among the buildings.

37
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,290
It looks like some kind of signal,
so I can't forget it.

38
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,492
Why don't you look? What?

39
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,994
I have to go.

40
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,461
Where are you going?

41
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,631
Let me see.

42
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,134
I think Ryo's also been going out at
around this time for about a week.

43
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,602
Every time I try to mention that light,
he's always gone.

44
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,939
Every time the light shines...

45
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,153
Something is suspicious.

46
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,280
He's heading in the direction from
which the light is coming.

47
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,815
I wonder what he's doing without telling me?

48
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,296
New Life Apartments

49
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,701
An apartment?

50
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,439
It's like he's going to see his mistress.

51
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,340
Mistress? Oh, no way!

52
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,545
No way, I don't believe that
Ryo has a mistress.

53
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,717
Hi.

54
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,722
Welcome!

55
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,693
His mistress?

56
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,115
I'll never forgive him! Ryo!

57
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,523
You jerk!

58
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,897
You traitor! Die!

59
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,433
Wait, Kaori! Don't be hasty!

60
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,028
You've got a mistress and
you're hiding it from me!

61
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,809
A girl?

62
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,181
You idiot!

63
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,617
What kind of way is that to
enter a patient's room?!

64
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,746
Patient?

65
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,623
What did you do? You're so careless!


66
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,296
You!

67
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,427
You're Mr. Saeba's younger
brother, aren't you?

68
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,898
Incredible! You came in through the
window, just like Mr. Saeba did.

69
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,945
Mr. Saeba, you tried to hide the fact
Mr. Kaoru was also coming, didn't you?

70
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm a woman.

71
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,052
Well, how do you know about me?

72
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,917
Because I see you all the time
with the telescope.

73
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,394
I'm so happy! I can't believe both
of you are here to visit me!

74
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,589
Hey, Ryo, what's going on here?

75
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,492
What was that noise?

76
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,370
Sister!

77
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,639
She's your sister?

78
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,106
Oh, boy.

79
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,371
She's Kozue Makihara.

80
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,285
Her lower body was paralyzed in an
accident, so she can't walk.

81
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,220
Her only source of entertainment

82
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,484
is looking at the city with her telescope.

83
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,660
One day, she found our apartment.

84
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,723
Our active lifestyle was attractive
and caught her attention.

85
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,566
She knows that it's not right, but she couldn't
stop herself from watching us everyday.

86
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:54,067
You realized it and went to visit
her apartment, didn't you?

87
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,544
Well, I am not busy at all, just like her.


88
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,080
So I'm just spending some
time talking to her.

89
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,249
That light was a sign asking you
to come, wasn't it?

90
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,913
Yes! Actually, sunlight reflects on
her telescope in the evening.

91
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,557
Well, I see.

92
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,826
Then why didn't you tell me?!

93
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,895
Why did you keep it a secret?

94
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,497
Don't treat me like a stranger!

95
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,058
No way! Why should I tell you?!

96
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,068
It's not cool,

97
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,403
and I am a big man.

98
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,572
Ryo...

99
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,375
By the way, Kaori!

100
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,812
Why did you rush into her room so mad?

101
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,841
Is that jealousy, maybe?

102
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,521
Idiot, no, it's not that!

103
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,854
Hey, why am I your younger brother?

104
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,662
Well, you're so strong, Kaori, so
Kozue probably misunderstood.

105
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,571
Then why didn't you correct
the misunderstanding?!

106
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,038
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,375
I hate hospitals!

108
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:11,350
There's nothing there to stimulate
my imagination!

109
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,217
I was so happy when I was able
to come home from the hospital.

110
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:19,386
I was able to get to know you,
Mr. Saeba and Ms. Kaori.

111
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,954
I've been longing for...

112
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,234
Someday, I'll be like a sister to
Mr. Saeba and Ms. Kaori

113
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,429
and we can walk down the street together.

114
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,907
So when Mr. Saeba came into
my room through the window,

115
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,534
I was really surprised,

116
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,139
but I felt that it was my fate.

117
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,284
Now, Ms. Kaori is here too.

118
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:49,388
But I mistook you for his younger brother.

119
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,685
I'm so sorry.

120
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,186
It's okay. People are often
mistaken about me.

121
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:01,858
Hey, is Mr. Saeba really a private
detective or something like that?

122
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,769
Private detective!

123
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,774
What are you talking about
all of the sudden?!

124
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,777
Because it's impossible for a regular person

125
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,879
to come in through this window, isn't it?

126
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,948
Also, I'm pretty sure that he
came to check this place

127
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:20,908
because he thought some enemy spy
was watching him.

128
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:25,045
In order to deceive his enemies,
he usually looks funny.

129
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,088
Right? I am right, Kaori?

130
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,489
She has a lot of imagination!
Actually, she's half right.

131
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,771
Kozue, he's just an apartment manager
and has a lot of free time.

132
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,604
I live with him and since
I'm telling you, it's true.

133
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,565
I wonder?

134
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,903
Oh, I know another person, a detective!

135
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,993
Is he really a private detective?

136
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,397
Yes, he's there once in a while,
watching this way.

137
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,594
This way? He looks scary, doesn't he?

138
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,338
His investigation involves my sister.

139
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,135
Your sister? Why?

140
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,766
Some rich guy fell in love with my sister,

141
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,442
so he asked a private detective
to investigate her.

142
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,474
Don't you think so?

143
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,452
I guess so.

144
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,388
I'm positive! She is going to be
part of a rich family!

145
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,490
We're going to be rich!

146
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,825
What will I do when I have money?

147
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,885
I feel something strange about him.

148
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,607
I can't believe how much
we can see from here!

149
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,354
You can see your apartment.

150
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,123
Yes, I can see it very well.

151
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,613
I wonder what Ryo is doing now?

152
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,789
He's in my room. What is he doing?

153
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:16,033
He's such a jerk! My underwear!

154
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,073
Kozue, I have to go now, so see you later.

155
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,108
Sure!

156
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,566
I wonder if Mr. Saeba is
coming this evening?

157
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,081
My sister will be late from work.

158
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,012
Oh, don't worry. When you send a sign,
I'll let him go right away?

159
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,013
See you.

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,737
Well...

161
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,778
He's that detective. I wonder
what he's doing here?

162
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,002
You tried to get to my underwear!

163
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,663
I can't take my eyes off
of you for a second!

164
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,705
I was just kidding.

165
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,375
Hey, how long are you going to
stay smashed like that?

166
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,844
It's about time to go to visit
your princess, isn't it?

167
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,869
Not today, because I'm injured.

168
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,541
Also, her sister is not there because
she has to work late.

169
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,109
Oh, damn!

170
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,222
Just as I thought! That's your
real purpose, isn't it?!

171
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,214
You perverted, mokkori jerk!

172
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,591
Oh, time out, time out! I'm just kidding!

173
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,228
I haven't seen a sign from her yet, so...

174
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,634
What?

175
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,302
I'm tired.

176
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,203
That's really strange.
I'm tired.

177
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:57,897
That's really strange.

178
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,307
Don't you think it's too late?

179
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,298
She told me that she would send us
a sign a little while ago.

180
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,178
Is he a detective?

181
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,740
He looks like he's watching my apartment.

182
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,982
He looks weird, doesn't he?

183
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,285
Oh, no! Ryo!

184
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,761
He's trying to break through the door!

185
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,193
Isn't he a private detective?

186
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,472
Who is he?!

187
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,433
Oh, I'm going to send a sign to Mr. Saeba!

188
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,274
Someone help, somebody...

189
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,385
Help me!

190
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,779
Mr. Saeba!

191
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,065
Who the hell are you?!

192
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,074
Damn!

193
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,685
It's okay now.

194
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,788
This wound...

195
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,830
It's a bullet wound.

196
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,923
Ryo!

197
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,771
How is Kozue?

198
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,640
She's fine, but pretty upset.

199
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,164
Bring something cold to drink.

200
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,769
Kozue, it's time to go to bed.

201
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,663
No!

202
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,096
Kozue!

203
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,269
Kozue!

204
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,237
No, stay away from me!

205
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,904
Kozue!

206
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,182
Why did she have to suffer like that?!

207
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,962
I don't yet know why someone
tried to kill her.

208
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,802
Yuka, now I have something to ask you.

209
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,999
The wound on her body,
when did it happen?

210
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,206
It looks like a bullet wound and
the bullet is still inside.

211
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,572
Is her lower body paralyzed
because of the bullet?

212
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,611
Yes, it happened about six months ago.

213
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,794
Kozue was playing with her friends,

214
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,529
and she was late coming home.

215
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,225
So she was going to take a shortcut
through a construction area.

216
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,061
No way, you're gonna break your promise?!
You tricked me!

217
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,201
You're gonna break your promise?!

218
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,703
Aren't you? Hey, say something!

219
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,616
You jerk!

220
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,083
Wait!

221
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,043
Don't! Don't shoot!

222
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,688
She wasn't lucky.

223
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,128
The bullet went through the man's
body and straight into Kozue.

224
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,762
The bullet stayed in Kozue's spine.

225
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,602
It put pressure on her nervous system
and paralyzed her lower body.

226
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,278
We wanted to remove it, but the surgery
might have made it worse.

227
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,887
That's why...

228
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:46,758
But the doctors have finally found
a new surgical technique,

229
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,192
so Kozue is going into surgery next week.

230
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,630
If the bullet is removed, she will...

231
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,899
She'll recover, won't she?

232
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,366
Yes!

233
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,369
I see.

234
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,338
I know about that incident.

235
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,364
The guy who was killed was the leader
of a yakuza gang, wasn't he?

236
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:07,676
A few days later, a member of a rival
yakuza group was arrested.

237
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,816
A similar gun was found at the crime scene.

238
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,616
So the two incidents aren't related?

239
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,956
He's probably a sex offender.

240
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,291
Not really.

241
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,094
The method used was clean, unlike
a simple sexual offender.

242
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,062
Also, he had a clear plan.

243
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,589
Anyway, there's a good chance
that he will attack her again.

244
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,269
This place is dangerous, Yuka.

245
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,760
Both of you should come to my apartment.

246
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,539
Yes, excuse me, but both of you,
what are you anyway?

247
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,871
It's no big deal. We love to stick our
noses into situations like this.

248
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,383
Don't try to look cool!

249
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,352
Anyway, what do you think Kozue
would think about that?

250
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,515
She was so scared of you she might refuse.

251
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,837
Mr. Saeba!

252
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,110
Kozue, did I wake you up?

253
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,577
I was awake.

254
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,816
I'm sorry. That was a model gun.
It wasn't real.

255
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,283
Liar!

256
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,985
I'm sure.

257
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,854
Show me your gun.

258
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,023
Show me!

259
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,869
Good, I'm not scared at all,
just like I thought.

260
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,046
I was surprised because it
happened suddenly.

261
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,538
It's a gun, but since it's yours,
I won't be scared at all.

262
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:56,720
You use it for a good cause as a
private detective, don't you?

263
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,356
Incredible! I'm impressed.

264
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:11,001
Yes, I'm a private detective who came
to protect you from bad people.

265
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,805
This place is dangerous.

266
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,376
That bad guy might come here again,

267
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,345
so I want you to move to a safe place.

268
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,581
Where is it safe?

269
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,849
My apartment.

270
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,385
Wow! Of course I'm going! I'm going!

271
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,218
I can't believe I'll be with you
and Kaori all the time!

272
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,990
Then tomorrow, I'll come to pick you up.

273
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,727
Tomorrow? No, we're going to go right now!

274
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,229
Now?

275
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,664
But it's pretty late.

276
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:42,467
No, don't hesitate to do what's right.
Right, Mr. Saeba?

277
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,665
Wow, I'm so excited! I did it!
Wow, just like my dream!

278
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,540
What a strong girl.

279
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,988
Well, are you ready?

280
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,388
Ready! Let's go!

281
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:16,335
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

282
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:16,468
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

283
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,938
Now, we're going to Mr. Saeba's apartment
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

284
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:20,472
where I've been wanting to go.

285
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,440
Where I've been wanting to go.
But I couldn't do so

286
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,140
But I couldn't do so

287
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,608
My dream came true!
But I couldn't do so

288
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,677
Please look forward to seeing the next part!
But I couldn't do so

289
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:25,938
But I couldn't do so

290
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:36,443
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

291
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:42,849
You don't know the reason I'm here

292
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:57,776
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

293
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,143
I wouldn't have let you go

294
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:09,418
While I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

295
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:15,660
Everyday life is starting

296
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:25,936
In my mind, time has stopped

297
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:32,276
And a double-decker bus is passing

298
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,786
A police officer came to us and complained.

299
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,954
We shouldn't have moved Kozue and
her sister without their approval.

300
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,190
What is he talking about?
It was approved by Saeko.

301
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,027
Her surgery is coming soon so I don't
like him accusing us falsely.

302
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,097
He might be in trouble if the bullet
is removed from her.

303
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:52,731
Why?

304
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,532
Well...

305
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,868
The suspect in the shooting incident
was arrested, wasn't he?

306
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,236
City Hunter 2:

307
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,706
"Wanting to Fall in Love Just Like a Dream -
The Strategy of a Twelve Year Old Angel
(Part 2)"

308
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,640
If you miss it, you'll get lost.

309
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,901
Please look forward to the next episode
