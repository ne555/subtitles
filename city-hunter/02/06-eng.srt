Kazutomo Fujino:
A Retrospective
Collection

13
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:04,057
I'm very impressed with you, Mr. Higuma.
That you could obtain

14
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,060
the elusive masterpiece "My Daughter"
is simply amazing.

15
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,654
It was nothing. I had a little luck on my side.

16
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,199
You might say the fact that I was
once a student of Fujino Sensei

17
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,463
has been to my advantage in this business.

18
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:19,305
Still, you've recently acquired
masterpiece after masterpiece,

19
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,774
none of which were said to exist.

20
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:26,473
It would appear your ability as a
merchant exceeds that as an artisan.

21
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,448
Harsh words.

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,191
That young lady, I'm certain she's...

23
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,031
This painting is a forgery! A forgery!


24
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,334
How awful!

25
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,341
My "My Daughter" has been stolen! Thief!

26
00:02:55,341 --> 00:03:00,301
Ryo's a Nude Model?!
The Beautiful Artist Who Stole a Masterpiece

27
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,473
Come on, come on, date me!

28
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,554
Go for some tea?

29
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,558
I guess not.

30
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,127
Excuse me...

31
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:29,440
I must be cursed today. I'll purify
myself when I get home.

32
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:37,645
Come, o lost sheep, into the
God of Mokkori's arms!

33
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,792
Ow! What a place to be standing!

34
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,259
What's your name?!

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,595
Haruka!

36
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,961
Haruka? A nice name.

37
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,591
My name's Ryo! Date me!

38
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,637
Out of my way! I don't have time for this!

39
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,606
I have plenty of time!

40
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,039
Get off me, I say!

41
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,907
Miss, I think you better come with us.

42
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,880
Don't make a scene!

43
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,418
Kidnappers! Someone help!

44
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,455
Would you go on a date with me?

45
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,324
I'll do whatever you say, just do something!

46
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,291
Yes!

47
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,328
Matters being matters, you can't
have her, if you please.

48
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,564
Stay out of it!

49
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,532
I'm gonna hurt you!

50
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,565
Hurt me, you say?

51
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,904
Son-of-a...

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,749
Damn it! This ain't over!

53
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,910
Wait for me!

54
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,352
Are you okay, Haruka?

55
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:54,127
Wow! You are so tough! I'm impressed!

56
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,594
Don't forget about the date!

57
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,161
My! Not a serious bone in his body!

58
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,868
First off, I'll reserve a room.

59
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:06,328
My, a hotel would be a waste.
Why not your place?

60
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:11,575
Wow! This is little Ryo's lucky day!

61
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,804
Now that that's decided, time for mokkori!
Okay, let's go!

62
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,043
Kaori isn't here.

63
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,856
Please come in.

64
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,320
You sure do have a big place.

65
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,033
I guess one person won't be
an imposition, will it?

66
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:38,197
Not at all! I'd let a girl like you
stay with me forever!

67
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,998
Now, allow me to show you to the bedroom.

68
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,501
Bedroom?! Oh, I see.

69
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,269
If that's the case, you should have
said something sooner.

70
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,175
Where is the bedroom? Please show me.

71
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,121
Wow! What a bold statement!

72
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,453
The young women of today
are certainly progressive!

73
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,055
Come with me, before we have
any unwelcome visitors!

74
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,461
Here we go.

75
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,126
Okay, I've finished making the bed.

76
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,538
If you were so sleepy, you should
have told me sooner.

77
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,808
That was a good one, Haruka.

78
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:23,710
But if you think you've escaped my
mokkori clutches, think again! Haruka!

79
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,920
What do you think you're doing
in the middle of the day?!

80
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:34,460
You have it wrong, Kaori! She, I mean
Haruka, was accosted by some weirdos.

81
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,257
The one doing the accosting
was you, wasn't it?

82
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,930
You're wrong.

83
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,763
Someone's really after me, so I
asked for Mr. Saeba's help.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,491
You mean, you hired Ryo as a bodyguard?!

85
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,638
Yes! I thought no one could protect me
as well as Mr. Saeba.


86
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,270
I see. I was wrong.

87
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,876
I'm going to make dinner now. Join us?

88
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,651
Oh, thank you. I haven't had a bite
since this morning.

89
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,983
I'll make dinner right away then.
Please wait.

90
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,125
Mr. Saeba, who is that?

91
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,396
That's Kaori. He's my brother, see.

92
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:15,095
What?! You're kidding?!
So pretty, yet he's a man?!

93
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:20,195
And that's not the half of it.
He has an even bigger secret.

94
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,540
I can't say this out loud,
but he's really an okama.

95
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,179
Okama?!

96
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,781
He's utterly obsessed with it.

97
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,716
He makes his chest look bigger.
He wears women's panties.

98
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,789
As his brother, I'd like to help him
return to his normal self, but...

99
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,416
That would be wrong!

100
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,217
If that's what he wants, you
should leave him alone!

101
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:48,226
I just love okama!
They're all such fun people!

102
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,796
I'm going to go help Kaori!

103
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,837
Hold on, Haruka!

104
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,139
Perhaps that wasn't a good idea.

105
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,356
I'll kill him!

106
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,189
Have you gone nuts?! You mokkori maniac!

107
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,094
Wait.

108
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,029
Haruka, what is it?

109
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,965
Wow, Kaori, you actually have breasts!
They're the real thing!

110
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,761
The real thing?

111
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,874
Hey, are you wearing women's panties?

112
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,709
Of course I am!

113
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,212
Wow! You're really into this, Kaori!

114
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,737
What do you want?

115
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,883
I thought I'd come help you.

116
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,686
Oh, that's not necessary.

117
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,086
You're our guest, please
make yourself at home.

118
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,720
Okay, it looks like you're a very good
cook, so I'll leave you alone.

119
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,228
That's fine.

120
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,423
Okay, see you at dinner then.

121
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:58,233
What's up with her? A pervert.
A lady pervert!

122
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,064
What?! Someone stopped you
and she got away?!

123
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,701
Yeah, he was one tough character.

124
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,569
But we did follow 'em to his place though.

125
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,206
Good work considering you're bunglers.

126
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,646
I'm positive it was that girl
Haruka who stole it.

127
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,350
And the only one who knows the
painting is a fake is that girl, see?

128
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,129
Now, who the hell was
that trouble-maker?!

129
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,964
They say in the neighborhood

130
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,956
he's some mysterious guy
they call Mokkori Man.

131
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,737
In any event, I assume that girl
has the original painting.

132
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,432
I must have that painting!

133
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,165
And don't forget to recover the
forgery that was stolen!

134
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,942
We can't have her go running to
the police with it!

135
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,582
Yes, Sir!

136
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,550
Mokkori Man?

137
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:55,386
It looks so good! I can't believe
a man made this!

138
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,858
A man?! How's that?

139
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,725
Right?

140
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,564
I see! That's what it was! Ryo!

141
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,776
Wait! Wait! Let me explain!

142
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,835
Don't waste your breath!

143
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,544
Sorry for wearing women's panties there!

144
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,412
Kaori, I'm sorry, believing
what Ryo said like that.

145
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,728
I don't mind, Haruka. I'm used to it.

146
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,788
You have no plans to marry
Mr. Saeba yet, Kaori?

147
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:39,199
Marry?! Well, I'm not with him...

148
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,498
You're right. Marriage is just a formality.

149
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,933
What's important is whether you
love each other or not.

150
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,537
Love each other...

151
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,186
Anyway, Kaori, you sure have
nice proportions.

152
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,211
Why, I could fall for you myself!

153
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:01,227
I could tell your breasts were firm when
I touched them. They're ideal.

154
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,462
Thank you.

155
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,931
Oh! I have to finish peeling this apple.

156
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,126
Please relax in the living room, okay?

157
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,302
Okay! Later!

158
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,599
Later...

159
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,933
She is a pervert! A female pervert.

160
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:31,319
I must boost my energy for mokkori
with Haruka tonight!

161
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,004
Fighto-ippatsu!


162
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:46,968
Mokkori Drink

163
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,075
For that explosive mokkori power!

164
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,470
Mr. Saeba, you're so cool!

165
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,479
Your fearless expression,
your powerful chest,

166
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,012
and the tight butt so characteristic
of an athlete.

167
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,185
I'm so overwhelmed. I'd love to
take your clothes off.

168
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,621
Then you shall. Please see
my body for yourself.

169
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,858
Let us go to the bedroom, then.

170
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,826
Oh, what's wrong with here?

171
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,858
Here?

172
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,302
Your boldness is what I love about you!

173
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,802
Haruka!

174
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,176
Kaori!

175
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,549
Here, apples for dessert.

176
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,589
So considerate.

177
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,358
You look hot. Shall I turn on
the air conditioner?

178
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,987
That isn't necessary. I'm cool just as I am.

179
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,600
You year-around mokkori idiot!

180
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,761
You got it wrong! Haruka said
she wanted to see me nude!

181
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,139
You liar!

182
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,197
It's true.

183
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,576
I asked him because I wanted
to do a sketch.

184
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,978
A sketch?!

185
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,173
You mean, to pose for a picture?

186
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,744
Yes! Models with the fine symmetry of
Mr. Saeba are few and far between.

187
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,486
Oh, you're an artist.

188
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,292
Where are you going?

189
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,427
Oh, just some errands.

190
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:19,488
It's not like you to worry about that stuff
when you can get naked instead.

191
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,636
But I've never taken my clothes off
to pose for a picture before.

192
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,834
What are you waiting for?! Take your
clothes off like a man! Take 'em off!

193
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,674
Right! Take 'em off! Take 'em off!

194
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,278
You're both awful!

195
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,408
I will protect my manly integrity
by force of will, if I must!

196
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,249
My, you two are having so much fun.

197
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,944
Saeko!

198
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,285
Help me...

199
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,693
You're not dressed to be saved!

200
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:57,098
How much longer?! I'm exhausted!

201
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,599
That's enough! A tough guy
like you doesn't whine!

202
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,250
No arguing with genes all right.

203
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,252
I'm not sure what you mean.

204
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,846
Never mind, just talking to myself.

205
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,157
Thanks for the tea.

206
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,318
See you later, Ryo.

207
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,857
I wonder what Saeko wanted?

208
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,535
Well...

209
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,082
Papa...

210
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,743
"My Daughter?"

211
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,855
A late work by the brilliant artist
Kazutomo Fujino

212
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,957
who died prematurely at age thirty-five.


213
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,927
Am I correct?

214
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,394
Yes, that's right.

215
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,526
The dilettantes refer to it as one of the
most elusive of masterpieces.

216
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,004
I hear there was a theft at a
gallery exhibition today.

217
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,801
That's right! I was the thief!

218
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,835
But the painting on display was a forgery!


219
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,581
This picture was painted for me by my father.

220
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,720
When my father died, the rest of his
paintings went to other people,

221
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,197
but this one I couldn't let go.

222
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,197
Now it's the only memento
I have of my father.

223
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,139
I was so angry. He was my father's student,


224
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,937
yet Higuma has this forgery of
my father's work in his gallery.

225
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,502
The next thing I knew, I had
the fake in my hands.

226
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,048
I get it. That's why those guys are after you.


227
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,490
He's in Haruka's room. I knew it!

228
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:07,657
I can't even take the time for a bath.
Just you watch, you mokkori...

229
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,068
Kaori!

230
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:29,552
We have your partner. You know what
we're after, don't you?

231
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,692
Excellent, we'll make the trade in one hour.

232
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,660
Warehouse Seven on Tokyo Wharf.

233
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,658
I just want to make this a fair transaction.

234
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,890
I want you two to come alone and
bring the two paintings.

235
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,774
My luck couldn't be better.

236
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,368
I never dreamed I'd get the
original "My Daughter."

237
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,973
Mr. Saeba, their objective is this painting.

238
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,883
Let's give it to them and save Kaori!

239
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,373
That's not all they want.

240
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,521
Their objective is to get the original painting

241
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,319
and to kill us because we
know about the fake.

242
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,817
Saeba, you say that so calmly.

243
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,656
I feel sorry for them. They chose the
wrong guy to mess with!

244
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,127
Okay, that's far enough!

245
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,706
I see you've kept your promise.

246
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,109
And you can see our hostage here is unhurt.

247
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,633
Ryo! Haruka!

248
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,915
As you can see, I brought both paintings!
Please let Kaori go!

249
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,406
Certainly, after all, this is a fair transaction.


250
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,108
Now, would you bring both
paintings over here?

251
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,491
I have it! Now I have the
original "My Daughter!"

252
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,536
What?!

253
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,767
Which one is which?! Which is the original?!

254
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,070
Higuma, I see it's not only your heart,
but your eyes which are bad.

255
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:41,784
That just means Kazutomo Fujino's original
work wasn't as good as I thought it was!

256
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,648
What did you say?! You're terrible!

257
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,187
I'll get you back for today.

258
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,497
You must be stupid to come here trusting
what the boss said like that.

259
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,436
That's not nice.

260
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:05,269
I'd think talk like that from an employee
would hurt your bonus pay.

261
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,308
That idiot, what's he doing?
What's he waiting for?!

262
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:15,621
Hey, Saeko! Ole' Mr. Higuma here is
getting into a tizzy. Come on out!

263
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,715
What? You knew? This isn't any fun!

264
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:24,196
You wouldn't come strolling in to my place
unless you had a very good reason!

265
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,790
But at least I've paid you back one
of my I.O.U's, you think?

266
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,997
Darn! Listen to her!

267
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,669
Hey, shut up there!

268
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,036
Don't forget we still have a strong
bargaining chip in our hostage here!

269
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,157
How dare you make an idiot of me?!

270
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,886
Uh-oh! Get down!

271
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,346
Give a gun to Kaori and this is what happens.

272
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,316
What are you waiting for?! Get him!

273
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,112
The love of money is the root of all evil.

274
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,978
You want to carry that painting
across the River Styx?

275
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,167
It appears business was very good
for the fakes he made here.

276
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,406
Indisputable evidence.

277
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,873
My thanks, Ryo.

278
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,965
Whatever you say.

279
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,341
But which one is the real one here?

280
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:28,620
Saeko, look here. All you do is use people.

281
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,323
It's not only your heart, but your eyes
which are bad, don't you think?


282
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,493
What did you say, Ryo?!
What do you mean by that?!

283
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,694
This is what I mean.

284
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,718
Ryo!

285
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,659
Mr. Saeba!

286
00:21:53,312 --> 00:22:00,741
A forgery couldn't hope to recreate the love
of a father painted on the white canvas.

287
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,317
Oh, yeah. I see.

288
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,752
Mr. Saeba, thank you.

289
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:32,348
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no

Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa

297
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,525
Don't you, don't you know

298
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:19,898
Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

299

Baby I got, ai ga jinsei no motion,

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,636
Hontou no dance, chance,

301
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,118
The sparkling ocean and radiant nature!

302
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,521
Oh, it's so wonderful! I feel like
my soul's been cleansed!

303
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,122
Now, if only there were lots and
lots of beautiful women,

304
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,490
it'd be the perfect paradise!

305
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,758
What are you thinking?!

306
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,660
We came because there are people
trying to forcefully buy

307
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,096
the island from Chihiro-chan,
who guards the island!

308
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,664
Then why is Umibozu here too?!

309
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:53,865
He's here to watch you, Ryo.

310
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,900
Don't you trust me?

311
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,034
Of course not!

312
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,436
City Hunter 2:

313
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,072
"Tropical Island Assignment -
The Coconut Girl and a Paradise of Love"


314
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,869
You're going to get one if you don't watch it.

315
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:07,210
Please look forward to the next episode
