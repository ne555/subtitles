00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,556
Hey, Ryo, please protect Mr. Keiichi!

13
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,734
He's a witness for a trial, but
someone is trying to kill him!

14
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,203
This is Saeko's request, isn't it?

15
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,104
No, I won't do it.

16
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,107
That's what I'd like to say, but
this is a great opportunity

17
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,908
for me to get to know Keiichi's
twin sister Keiko.

18
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,143
Of course I'll accept it.

19
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,246
Anyway, Mr. Keiichi's female
disguise is incredible.

20
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,713
He's definitely an actor.

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,850
I wonder if I might get the wrong idea?

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,184
Hey, watch out!

23
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,521
Well, anyway, in order for him
to protect himself,

24
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,490
I decided to teach Keiichi
how to fire a gun.

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,514
However...

26
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,761
It was a lie that he has a twin sister!

27
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,730
Keiichi, in fact, is a woman!

28
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,033
I'm going to have to keep this
a secret from Kaori!

29
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,993
Targeted Witness!
A Dangerous Beauty Dressed Up Like a Man
(Part 2)

30
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,044
Now I understand what's going on.

31
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,514
Keiichi is Keiko.

32
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,484
Saeko told me you're a twin,
but she was lying.

33
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,154
I'm sorry to have tricked you.

34
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
I did a bad thing to Ms. Kaori too.

35
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,792
I didn't expect her to fall for me.

36
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,352
I have to tell her the truth.

37
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,358
No, I couldn't do that to her.

38
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,760
Kaori fell in love with you while
you were disguised as a man.

39
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,440
If she finds out you're a woman,
she'll be upset.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,843
I don't want to see her like that.

41
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,178
It's only two more days.

42
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,204
Can you remain as a man until that time?

43
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,548
Mr. Saeba...

44
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,826
Mr. Saeba learned of my disguise, but we're
keeping it a secret from Ms. Kaori.

45
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,925
It's odd, isn't it?

46
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,670
Hi, Keiichi!

47
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,277
We're both men, so why don't we
wash the sweat off of each other

48
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,904
and build up a stronger relationship?

49
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,598
Nice catch!

50
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,301
What the hell are you doing, Ryo?

51
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:01,341
I wanted to have a discussion
with him while we're naked,

52
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,673
but I guess Keiichi is very shy.

53
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:09,741
Oh, God, please protect me.

54
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,191
Well, open your mouth.

55
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,759
Don't hesitate.

56
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
Open!

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,161
Chew it well, okay?

58
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,253
Mr. Saeba...

59
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,634
Well, when did you get that intimate?

60
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,534
Well, it's not a big deal.

61
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,970
We've had some miscommunication
up until a little while ago,

62
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,801
but it's all gone now.

63
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,442
I see, but you look like you're in some
kind of abnormal atmosphere.

64
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,147
Well, that's what the deep relationship
between men is about,

65
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,583
which is not comprehensible to a woman.

66
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,619
We're best friends now, aren't we?

67
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,086
Yes...

68
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,226
So, we're going to sleep
together tonight too.

69
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,228
It looks like it's going to be
very cold tonight,

70
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,929
so even though we're both men,

71
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,863
we can hold each other and
warm ourselves up.

72
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,059
No, no way!

73
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,902
I don't care.

74
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,039
You two get along rather well, so you can
protect him thoroughly, can't you?

75
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,200
Of course, 24 hours, thoroughly.

76
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,877
I forgot to tell you.

77
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,013
The futon that I took to the cleaners is
finished and was delivered a little while ago.

78
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,981
You don't need to share a bed any more.

79
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,219
Mr. Keiichi, why don't you use
the guest room tonight?

80
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,584
Sure!

81
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,922
Goodnight.

82
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,726
This is great.

83
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,717
I can finally get a good night's sleep.

84
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,666
Hey, Kaori, who has long legs and
looks really good in jeans,

85
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,066
I would like to sleep with Keiichi.

86
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,306
Since when do you have interests like that?

87
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,638
Oh, no, I didn't mean that.

88
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,245
What's wrong with him?

89
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,770
He hated having to share a bed
with Mr. Keiichi before.

90
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,614
Guest Room

91
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,294
During this time of the year, I feel
lonely when I'm alone in bed.

92
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,592
I think I should share Kei's bed.

93
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:19,041
Ryo's here, Kei!

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,083
Why the hell are you here, Kaori?!

95
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,797
Right before I went to bed,
Mr. Keiichi came to me

96
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,561
and said that he felt some kind of danger.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,004
He looked really serious, so I offered
to exchange rooms with him.

98
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,700
I didn't mind doing so if it would
help him sleep better.

99
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,441
Then...

100
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,803
I can't believe you actually came in
here to do something to him!

101
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,418
You've degenerated too much, Ryo Saeba!

102
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,553
Shame on you!

103
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,679
Wait, you misunderstand.

104
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,146
Shut your mouth!

105
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,096
Take this, 100-ton hammer, double attack!

106
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,935
Damn, it's getting late.

107
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,643
I didn't want to believe that
he discovered my trap,

108
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,841
but he is Ryo Saeba.

109
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,379
What a troublesome man I have to deal with!

110
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,624
What a beautiful morning! Excellent!

111
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,060
What the hell is so beautiful
about this morning?!

112
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,052
It took me all night to convince Kaori.

113
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,634
I'll be really tough on you during
your shooting lesson today.

114
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,431
Oh, no!

115
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,140
Please, please forgive me, Mr. Saeba!

116
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,441
All right.

117
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:59,612
If you share your beauty with me
mouth-to-mouth, then I'll forgive you.

118
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,579
Wait a second!

119
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,082
You have Kaori!

120
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,051
As I told you before, Kaori is my partner.

121
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,980
For my partner, as a man, there is
nobody except you!

122
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,992
Mr. Saeba...

123
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,211
One, two!

124
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,513
Three, four!

125
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,648
Five, six, seven, eight!

126
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,377
Now, move your arms!

127
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,951
One, two!

128
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,419
Straighten your back!

129
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,524
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

130
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,651
Finally, take a deep breath!

131
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,633
Now, the morning exercise is over.

132
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,502
Now, run to the shooting range
for your lesson.

133
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,835
One, two! One, two! One, two!

134
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,490
Were we able to fool her?

135
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,183
Probably...

136
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,762
Ms. Kaori?!

137
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,366
Mr. Saeba!

138
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,655
Just as I thought.

139
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,823
He's such a pervert!

140
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,660
He doesn't even intend to kiss me
despite the fact we're living together!

141
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,795
But what was that?!

142
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,423
He does something like that with a man
living with us for only four days!

143
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,603
He ignored a woman like me and
tried to score with him, a man?!

144
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,403
Damn it!

145
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,863
He's saying that my sex appeal
is inferior to his, isn't he?

146
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,822
Excuse me, cute lady?

147
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,763
Cute? Oh, no!

148
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,390
Are you talking to me?

149
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,466
Yes, that's right.

150
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,002
Be quiet and get in the car!

151
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,999
Why does this usually end up
being my role?!

152
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,318
I guess it was a big shock to Ms. Kaori.

153
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,622
I wonder where she went?
I'm worried about her.

154
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:00,292
Every time she gets mad at me,
she goes out to flirt with guys.

155
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,260
Shouldn't we look for her?

156
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,867
Rather than doing that, while Kaori
is gone, we're alone...

157
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,357
Mr. Saeba!

158
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,098
The phone! I'm sure it's from Ms. Kaori!

159
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,346
I have your woman.

160
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,551
Saying that, you now know
who I am, don't you?

161
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,458
Kei, if it's Kaori,

162
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,450
tell her to come home soon so she
can cook something for us.

163
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,735
What do you want?

164
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,103
Is Kaori all right?

165
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,204
Yes...

166
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,607
If your important partner was hurt,

167
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,371
you'd chase me to all ends of the world.

168
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,543
I'll return her right after the
session ends tomorrow.

169
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,017
I see.

170
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:02,420
What you really meant to say was that
Keiko shouldn't appear in court, right?

171
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,424
Indeed. This was a quick negotiation.

172
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,619
Then, I'll talk to you after the session.

173
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,465
Road Map

174
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,966
Road Map
Mr. Saeba!

175
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,455
Road Map
Yes?

176
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,970
How long do you plan to do things like that?

177
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,428
We have to hurry and look for
Ms. Kaori, or she might be...

178
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,571
But I have no idea where she was taken.

179
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,547
Why don't we go for a drive?

180
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,716
We'll have a great time while she's gone!

181
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,786
I can't believe you! No way!

182
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,310
I can't do that at a critical time like this!

183
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,992
Hey!

184
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,561
How long are you going to
keep me like this?!

185
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,896
Untie the rope!

186
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,298
Why can't you tie me up in an ordinary way?!

187
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,366
You pervert!

188
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,334
Dirty old man!

189
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,035
Bad, middle-aged man!

190
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,969
Hey, say something!

191
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,309
Shut your mouth!

192
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,912
I intend to keep you alive.

193
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,473
If you keep screaming like that,
I might change my mind.

194
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,780
Good girl.

195
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,647
Be as quiet as you can.

196
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,996
It's no good.

197
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,827
I can't escape from here by myself.

198
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,700
Ryo can't find me here.

199
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,292
I don't know what to do.

200
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:59,138
Excuse me, Mr. Saeba, but we've been
driving around for two hours.

201
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,504
Do you think we'll be able to
find Ms. Kaori like this?

202
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,873
Keiko, did you really think that
I've been looking for Kaori?

203
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,848
Then what have you been doing?

204
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,283
I can't believe that you've been
driving just for fun.

205
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,351
No way.

206
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,452
If I'd been driving for fun,

207
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,919
I would have gone to the seashore
or some other place.

208
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,323
Then why?

209
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,425
To spend some time together,
just you and me.

210
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,985
I'm looking for a nice hotel.

211
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,462
What the hell is this man thinking?

212
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,102
You see that?

213
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,704
That's the best one.

214
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,005
Stop it!

215
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,474
We don't have time to fool around!

216
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,910
But that hotel is so high class
that it's not fit for me.

217
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,083
Tsukasa

218
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,689
Traditional Japanese style isn't bad, is it?

219
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,589
I want neither Japanese nor Western style!

220
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,754
Hotel Shatolene

221
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,190
Hotel Evening

222
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,699
Hotel
Persian Gulf

223
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,960
Hotel
Lover's Land

224
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,580
What's going on, Mr. Saeba?

225
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,047
Hold on! I'm going to fly!

226
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,899
I bet it's probably around here.

227
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,367
Around here?

228
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,373
What is this?

229
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,569
It's a device that I take personal pride in.

230
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,279
A map of this town?

231
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,144
What are those little lights?

232
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,650
Good question.

233
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,314
Those dots indicate all the
good hotels in this town.

234
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,192
Just kidding.

235
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,887
I'll turn on this switch.

236
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,352
One of the lights is blinking!

237
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,900
Just as I thought.

238
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,663
The location of this blinking light is...

239
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,437
The best hotel in town.

240
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,936
Now, let's go there!

241
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,754
Well, well, let's go, Keiko!

242
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,122
What are you thinking?

243
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,457
I won't get out of the car.

244
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,515
I'm not going to any hotel with you!

245
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,827
Don't worry.

246
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,294
It's not this one.

247
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,272
What is this place?

248
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,480
This was a good hotel until a short time ago,

249
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,482
but the location isn't that good and
there weren't enough customers,

250
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,983
so it went out of business.

251
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,418
But listen to this.

252
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,887
You can hear a familiar voice.

253
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,787
Indeed, this was a good hotel.

254
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,091
I'm hungry.

255
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,991
Let me eat something!

256
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,428
Are you trying to kill me by starving me
to death? You jerk!

257
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,732
Hurry up and fall asleep!

258
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,434
You won't feel hungry then.

259
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,334
I'm too hungry to fall asleep.

260
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,405
It's Kaori.

261
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,640
Then she's in the next room?

262
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,508
Yes, that's why I told you that
this was the best hotel.

263
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,205
But why this place?

264
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,813
It doesn't matter. We have to
hurry and rescue her.

265
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,509
Oh, wait.

266
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,954
We don't need to be hasty.

267
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,956
We know now that Kaori is all right.

268
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,026
Why don't we spend a night together,
just the two of us, and...

269
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,551
I can't believe you.

270
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,371
Hold it instead!

271
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,242
Keiko is so important!

272
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,938
I didn't know that she brought one
of the guns from my house.

273
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,285
Damn, I can't trust him at all.

274
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,152
Also, she's in this situation because of me!

275
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,392
What a noisy woman!

276
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,561
I guess I need to put this on you again.

277
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,662
Stop!

278
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,098
I'll get a rash on my face if
you put that on again.

279
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,699
Why don't you kill me, if you can?

280
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,268
I know that you're actually afraid of
Ryo and won't do anything!

281
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,870
Whatever.

282
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,838
This is the professional way.

283
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,548
Freeze!

284
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,651
A friend of hers?

285
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,954
I guess you came here to rescue her.

286
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,223
You did a good job finding me here,

287
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,690
but you're unlucky as now you
have to deal with me.

288
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,992
You, your face!

289
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,260
Kei Kashiwagi!

290
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,293
No way!

291
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,090
From the other side of the wall?!

292
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,397
Freeze!

293
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,262
I'm sure that you're unlucky as now
you have to deal with me.

294
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,060
Well, I won't kill you today.

295
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,303
I might need you to testify as a witness.

296
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,581
Good job, Ryo.

297
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,242
Leave everything to me.

298
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,451
You not only protected Mr. Keiichi,
but also found another witness.

299
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,649
You planned it that way, didn't you?

300
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,393
Well, I'm sorry.

301
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,528
It's because of me...

302
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,825
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,099
It's my fault this time.

304
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,566
Please forgive me.

305
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,974
No, what you just said doesn't fit your image.

306
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,738
I have to be more careful so things
don't end up like this.

307
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,244
Why don't you get mad at me as usual?
I can't keep my ordinary place.

308
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,020
I can't believe you found this place.

309
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,544
How did you do it?

310
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,056
A button.

311
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,794
The button on your clothing is a transmitter.

312
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,286
But it's small and the power is weak.

313
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,291
I can only pick it up within
a radius of one kilometer.

314
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:40,168
That's why it took us so long to catch
the transmitter's signal.

315
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,106
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,112
Ryo!

317
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,504
I've got to go now.

318
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,739
Be strong.

319
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,606
Thank you, Mr. Saeba, Ms. Kaori.

320
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,711
Thank you, Mr. Keiichi.

321
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,941
I'm sorry that you were put
in danger because of me.

322
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,210
Sorry to you too. I got you involved
in this matter, Ms. Kaori.

323
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,052
Well, Mr. Kashiwagi, shall we go?

324
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,683
Oh, yes.

325
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,098
I can't do anything else but run
away from them, I guess.

326
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,499
I can't force myself between those two.

327
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,247
By the way, you didn't look
very persistently at him

328
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,482
even though you were saying goodbye
to your lovely man.

329
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,118
I told you it's your misunderstanding.

330
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,853
How about you?

331
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,946
The man you love is gone.

332
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,257
That's okay.

333
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,259
I was just feeling admiration towards him.

334
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,025
Also, I've realized now that I have
someone more important than him.

335
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:33,039
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no

Don't you, don't you know

347
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,053
Someone from Interpol told me that
my late brother smuggled drugs.

348
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:42,654
What?

349
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,090
I told them that my brother
hadn't given me anything.

350
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,925
I don't understand why they're so
persistent and chase me around.

351
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,756
I believe in Makimura.

352
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,462
However, as long as I see the information...

353
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,398
No! My brother hated drugs!

354
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,366
It shouldn't have happened.

355
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,335
I wonder what he wanted to do?

356
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,703
City Hunter 2:

357
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:02,007
"Message from Makimura
Memories Forever (Part 1)"

358
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,032
The opening theme song will be a new one.

359
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,111
Please look forward to the next episode
