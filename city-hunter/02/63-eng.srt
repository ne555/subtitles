1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:15,815
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:25,247
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:33,561
Lady in the middle of the night,
blending in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:41,165
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:46,146
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,478
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,453
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,752
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:04,798
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:11,838
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:19,446
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:29,412
Oh, Sarah, it's starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,665
Mary, why did you come to me?
Not for mokkori with me?

14
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,301
I came to kill you.

15
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,503
Just as I thought, but why?

16
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,472
If I kill you, Eric's life will be saved.

17
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,043
I've lived in a dark underground world,


18
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,375
but he is the person who guided me
to the bright sunlight.

19
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,374
As soon as we arrived at the airport,
he was suddenly kidnapped.

20
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,054
I didn't have any other way except
by doing this to try and kill you.

21
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,217
Mary, leave things to me now.

22
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:11,353
No, I am sorry Ryo, but I can't cause
any more trouble for you guys.

23
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,994
Good Luck, My Sweeper
City Streets for Both of Us
(Part 3)

24
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,806
I will rescue him by myself, even if I
have to exchange my life for his!

25
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,587
No!

26
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:41,550
I'd rather die, to make sure he never gets
involved with a matter like this ever again!

27
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,392
Who?!

28
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,199
Good evening.

29
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,801
Kaori, why?

30
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,804
I thought you would do this. Let's go back.

31
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,973
We ought to get Ryo's help.

32
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,142
No way. I can't do that.

33
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,111
Just as I thought you would say.

34
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,082
Then, I will go with you.

35
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,071
Kaori!

36
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,978
Weapons, I brought many weapons, see.

37
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,388
Get out of the car.

38
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,957
You are an amateur and can't be used
except as a distraction.

39
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,051
I am not as rank an amateur as you think.

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,593
Also, if I am with you, you can't die, Mary.
If you die among enemies, it means I'll die.

41
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,097
I'm your lucky charm.

42
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,676
What do you mean?

43
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,311
I understand even though you hide it.

44
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,246
I am a cold woman.

45
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,349
You know that the best, don't you?

46
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,586
If you die or survive,
I don't give a damn either way.

47
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,455
No, you're a kind person.

48
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:47,085
Why didn't you kill him instantly
when you came to see him?

49
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,953
Because I am with him, you
thought I would be in pain.

50
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,802
That's why you tried to make me
go back to the ordinary world,

51
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,101
to make me break up with Ryo.
You did things like that.

52
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,644
You failed so you had no other choice
except challenging Ryo.

53
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,272
But what you really hoped for was...

54
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,316
You prayed that Ryo would
fight against you.

55
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,285
You wanted to die by his hand,
but Ryo didn't fight against you.

56
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,189
It's my pleasure that you
think so highly of me.

57
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,191
Well, anyway, you don't have any other
choice except taking me with you.

58
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,092
The final destination is right there.

59
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:26,924
You fool.

60
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,241
Just as I thought...

61
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:39,371
Kaori went with Mary with as many
weapons as she could carry.

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,649
Thank you for your work, Umibozu.

63
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,776
It's time for you to go back to Miki.

64
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,441
What do you want? I told you to
go back to Miki.

65
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,673
Mary took my Land Cruiser with her.
I have to get it back.

66
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,341
I see, to get it back.

67
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,727
What the hell?!

68
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,563
Guards are everywhere, looking
around without sleeping.

69
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,795
It's impossible to sneak into this place.
We have to rush in by force.

70
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,570
Kaori, you should go home now as I said.

71
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,834
I can't withdraw since I'm already here.

72
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,174
I'm going to make an opening!

73
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,647
Trust me! I'm going to prove to you
that I'm not an amateur.

74
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,274
Kaori, that's the wrong way!

75
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,389
Who said you are not an amateur?

76
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,856
Well...

77
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:08,901
How did they know we were behind them?

78
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,462
See! I knew there were enemies behind us.

79
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,908
Enemy attack! Someone snuck in!

80
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,543
We have no choice! Let's go!

81
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,339
Sure!

82
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,324
When I get mad, I'm fearless. I don't care
what's gonna happen to you!

83
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,603
Hey, hey, if you don't want to die,
get out of my way!

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,469
What a ridiculous woman she is!

85
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,986
What the hell is going on out there?!

86
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,154
I am so sorry.

87
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,646
Two women suddenly attacked us with an
unbelievable amount of firepower!

88
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,726
What? Women?

89
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,997
Can you send some interior guards
over there to fight them?

90
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,866
Gather everybody into the central
lobby on the second floor.

91
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,700
What?

92
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,002
Hurry up!

93
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,129
Yes, Sir. I will!

94
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,103
Bloody Mary is here.

95
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,411
Where is he? Where is Clive?

96
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,824
Yes, he is probably in the central lobby
on the second floor.

97
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:38,791
Are you sure?!

98
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,522
Yes, it's true! Please don't
kill me, please, lady!

99
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,567
Central lobby on the second floor, right?
Let's hurry!

100
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,534
Wait!

101
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,533
Mary...

102
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,214
Thank you, Kaori.

103
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,395
Kaori is surely with her, just as I thought.

104
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,693
She fired everywhere quite wide of the target.


105
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:23,503
From a different point of view, her skill is
incredible. I would just kill everybody.

106
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,529
But it's too quiet here; something is not right.

107
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,943
Isn't that Kaori, sleeping over there?

108
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,137
Oh, boy...

109
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,276
Hey, Kaori! Wake up, Kaori!

110
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,187
Ryo!

111
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,125
If you sleep in a place like this,
your cold will get worse again.

112
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,650
Oh, my God, Ryo, Mary went
ahead by herself!

113
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,403
It's strange. There's no enemy so far.

114
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,631
This might be a trap.

115
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,769
How long do you intend to hide there, Mary?

116
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,407
You made a quite showy play, didn't you?

117
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,683
David Clive, I came here to kill you.

118
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,122
I guess you misunderstood.

119
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,420
The person you have to kill is Saeba.

120
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,190
Don't you want to save your lover?

121
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,926
You die first.

122
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,794
I guess I have no other choice.

123
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:40,813
What I am telling you is, if you kill Saeba,
I'll return your lover to you.

124
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,982
Do you want to choose stupid death
rather than your freedom?

125
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,819
Even if you try to fight back, you'll become
a piece of raw meat full of holes.

126
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,347
Even if I become a piece of raw meat,
the only thing I need is to fire a bullet.

127
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,126
Then, I will have killed you.

128
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,063
I know that these people are
all mercenaries anyway.

129
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,657
If you die, there is no one who
will kill Eric for you.

130
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,858
After the employer dies, the only
thing they do is leave.

131
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,366
Fire, fire! Shoot Mary!

132
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,749
What the hell are you doing?!
Don't run away! Come back!

133
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,918
What was that? What's going on?

134
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,461
The tables have turned, Clive.

135
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,461
Ryo! Kaori too!

136
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,531
Saeba! Damn!

137
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,098
Wait!

138
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,609
Freeze! If you move, I'm gonna kill this man.

139
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,909
You fool. You forgot that I've had a
trump card from the beginning.

140
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,215
Mary...

141
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,408
Eric!

142
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,920
The tables turn again!

143
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,879
Mary, if you don't want me to kill him,
shoot Saeba now, at this very second!

144
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,726
Saeba, if you don't want to be shot
by her, you shoot Mary!

145
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,068
The pair who brought me down
are going to kill each other.

146
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,270
This is the best show in the world.

147
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,238
Now, shoot each other!

148
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:28,850
Ryo!

149
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,917
Yes, go ahead! Shoot each other!

150
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,837
What's the matter, Mary? Hold your gun up!

151
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,547
Mary, he's right.

152
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,039
In order to save your lover, there's no other
way except for us to shoot each other.

153
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,419
No way, Ryo!

154
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,047
Mary, do whatever Ryo says.

155
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,018
When Ryo gives you the sign,
jump to the side.

156
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,726
Good! Yes, kill! Kill each other!

157
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,675
Good! Fabulous! Go ahead and do it!

158
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,973
What? Earthquake?

159
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,505
Now! Jump!

160
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,056
What the hell?

161
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,326
Umibozu was standing by just
in case of emergency.

162
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:19,365
He is a professional at demolition, so it was a
piece of cake for him to remove the floor.

163
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,529
Hey, Mary, your lover is fine,
unfortunately for me.

164
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,737
Ryo...

165
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,281
He always takes the choicest part

166
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,250
and makes me take the part
behind the scenes!

167
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,805
I am sorry, Eric.

168
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,630
Ryo, Kaori, I am so sorry for
being selfish all the time.

169
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,182
Indeed, this is such a showy piece of work.

170
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,517
When I got a call, I instantly
knew who did this.

171
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:49,112
There's nobody except you who can
start a war in the middle of town.

172
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,458
This time, I wasn't in a good mood.

173
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,959
Well, it's okay.

174
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,762
We were able to arrest a big one, David Clive.

175
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,459
He is such a big terrorist there's been an
international search for him.

176
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,136
It means he'll be in jail for
a long time, won't he?

177
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:08,402
Let's see. He probably won't ever
be able to get out of prison.

178
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:26,258
This is it. I won't come back
to Japan ever again.

179
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,625
Even if I go back to America, I can't
go back to New York, I guess.

180
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:35,501
But I was able to dream in the regular
world, even if just for a short while.

181
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,664
That's enough for me. I'm satisfied.

182
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,276
Bloody Mary, if you try to escape,
it will be useless.

183
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,040
I want you to go to the other world.

184
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,815
You're an assassin sent by Clive, aren't you?

185
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,650
But if you fire your gun in a place like this,

186
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,385
you won't have any way to escape.

187
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:57,823
Rather than worrying about me,
why don't you worry about Eric?

188
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,591
No way! You took Eric again?!

189
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,592
Freeze!

190
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,219
What? That gun?

191
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,097
You...

192
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,367
Ryo?!

193
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,705
Well, let's go back to Eric.

194
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,434
Don't stick your nose in my business.

195
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,909
There's no way that I can go back to Eric.

196
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,400
He already found out what
my real character is!

197
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,482
I don't think he would change his mind
because of something like that.

198
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,780
You really have changed.

199
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,189
Before, you weren't a person who stuck
your nose into everything like this.

200
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,191
You don't seem like yourself.

201
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,927
I can't change myself as you did.

202
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,727
I don't have the confidence to protect the
person I love while I'm in this business.

203
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,142
You're so cruel, Mary.

204
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,508
How dare you leave an injured
person like me behind?

205
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,281
Eric? Why, why are you here?

206
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,943
I am your fianc

207
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,420
But I...

208
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,256
No matter who you are, Bloody Mary or
Rosemary Moon, to me, Mary is Mary.

209
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:14,566
Thank you. I am really happy to hear that,
but no, I can't go with you.

210
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,332
If you are with me, a horrible incident
like this will happen again.

211
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,174
You should not be with a person like me!

212
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,300
Mary...

213
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,546
Excuse me, Mary, I don't know
you well, but I can say that

214
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,846
if you are with the person you love, you can
overcome no matter how big the difficulty is.

215
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,812
Kaori...

216
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,782
I guess...

217
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:43,796
Mary, what she just said was right.
If you run away from me now,

218
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,960
I will follow you to the ends of the
Earth, even if costs my life.

219
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,903
Please don't make me suffer like that.

220
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,804
If I have to suffer pain, I would
like to be with you.

221
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,334
Eric!

222
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:29,141
Kaori, I will try to be strong like you are.

223
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,508
And Ryo, I will try to change as you did.

224
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,995
Thank you, Ryo and Kaori,
you are great partners.

225
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,954
We will be as good partners as you are.

226
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,998
Good luck, Mary.

227
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,084
Here, enjoy your meal.

228
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,747
Wow, what's the matter? Such a treat
first thing in the morning!

229
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,658
I want you to work hard, Ryo!

230
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,453
Therefore, you need to get lots of nutrition.

231
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,330
I'm sorry to make you worry
about me that much.

232
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:39,363
I am your partner, so it's nothing strange
to care about your health.

233
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,204
Kaori...

234
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,975
Ryo...

235
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,817
Please, please make my age in the 20s!

236
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,087
What?

237
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,690
Please, Kaori, my Goddess!

238
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,127
It's embarrassing for the hero
of the story to be in his 30s!

239
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,630
At least, I want to be in the 20s, please!

240
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,466
No, no, no, no, no! I said no!

241
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,434
Your age was already defined in the 30s!

242
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,506
Well, there is a job waiting for you.

243
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,997
To be a bodyguard for the
daughter of a rich family.

244
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,408
What? The daughter of a rich family?

245
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:27,853
It's strange. You've really hated to get
a job request from women before.

246
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,983
Well, because the job request should
encourage the person who actually works.

247
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,859
I guess I got approved to do
mokkori on the job didn't I?

248
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,289
There, that's the client standing over there.

249
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,037
I decided to trust you from now on, Ryo.

250
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,709
Hey, hey wait, it's mokkori Ryo!

251
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,811
No! I don't know you!

252
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,608
Oh, no, don't be shy!

253
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,817
That jerk! He doesn't care what I feel!

254
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,850
Cut it out, you thirty-something jerk!

255
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,993
Well, I thought I got approval to do mokkori.

256
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:13,999
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

257
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,668
I'm going to cancel this job!
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

258
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,002
I wanted you to listen to my guitar

259
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,699
I wanted to convey my feelings
about you to you

260
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:26,600
But I couldn't do so

261
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:37,110
You don't know anything about
this town where I live

262
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:43,517
You don't know the reason I'm here

263
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:58,443
If that moment could have colored
the rows of old brick houses

264
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,810
I wouldn't have let you go

265
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:10,085
When I cross the park shining
in the winter sun

266
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:16,327
Everyday life is starting

267
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:26,603
In my mind, time has stopped

268
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,977
And a double-decker bus is passing
