Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,966
How can I help you?

14
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,957
Yes, actually,

15
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,304
I am seeking a person.

16
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,206
I thought you might know her, Ms. Nogami.

17
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,273
Seeking a person?

18
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,741
The person's name is Kaori Hisaishi.

19
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,167
Kaori Hisaishi?

20
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,279
Hisaishi...

21
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,984
You know her, as I thought, don't you?

22
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,680
I think her name is Kaori Makimura now.

23
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,589
How did you know that?

24
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,025
How do you know Kaori's
original family name?

25
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,515
Excuse me, but you are...

26
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,463
Kaori Makimura is my...

27
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,888
My younger sister.

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,060
Reunion After Twenty Years!
Please Look After My Sister, Mr. Saeba.
(Part 1)

29
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,902
Such a jerk, Ryo!

30
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:27,413
As soon as I took my eyes off him, he
went out because Saeko called him!

31
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:31,372
Another silly job or...

32
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,785
A date?

33
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,120
Ryo is such an idiot!

34
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,426
Oh, no...

35
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,241
Brother...

36
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,343
Ryo, what are you thinking?

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,787
About Makimura...

38
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,052
The day he died.

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,887
It was twenty years ago.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,990
My father, who was a police officer,
brought a baby home.

41
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,832
He told me,

42
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,262
"This baby is your sister from now on."

43
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,698
That baby was Kaori.

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,843
My father died in an accident while he
was chasing a murder suspect.

45
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,613
The suspect's name was Junichi Hisaishi,
Kaori's father.

46
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,816
Her mother was gone and
she was an orphan.

47
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,443
My father adopted her.

48
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,180
Tonight, Kaori's twentieth birthday,

49
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,657
I have to tell her the story,

50
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,656
and give her this ring, a memento
of her mother.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,197
However...

52
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,135
He wasn't able to tell Kaori.

53
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,936
Please look after Kaori.

54
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,173
And I couldn't tell her either.

55
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,451
She's probably telling the truth.

56
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,817
I think she is Kaori's sister.

57
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,123
Her name is Sayuri Tachiki.

58
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,391
Tachiki?

59
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,256
She uses her mother's maiden name.

60
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,193
Nice to meet you. I'm Sayuri Tachiki.

61
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,438
What graceful manners!

62
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,202
The nobility is overflowing from her body!
Oh, my God!

63
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:40,280
No way! A beautiful woman like her
can't be Kaori's sister!

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,681
Sayuri!

65
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,648
Ryo!

66
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,455
She might be her sister after all.

67
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,692
Two years ago, I found out that
my sister Kaori might be alive.

68
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:02,156
Two years ago, my mother told me
this story and passed away.

69
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,632
When I was two years old,
right after Kaori was born,

70
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,667
my parents divorced and my father
went missing with Kaori.

71
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,974
My father's name was Junichi.

72
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,516
He died in Tokyo,

73
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,610
and I learned that Kaori was adopted
by a detective named Makimura.

74
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,623
But I couldn't find out where
she was after that.

75
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,591
Mr. Saeba, is it?

76
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,028
I heard from Ms. Nogami that you
know where she is.

77
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,997
Please, please tell me where my sister is.


78
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:43,142
Sayuri, Kaori doesn't know
anything about this.

79
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,770
What are you going to do after telling her
that you're her sister?

80
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,644
Are you thinking about living with her?

81
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,653
I don't know.

82
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,248
But she is my only blood relative
in this world.

83
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,417
I desperately want to see her.

84
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,960
That's all.

85
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,936
Sayuri, I have one condition
to let you see Kaori.

86
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,638
Well, I should say I have a favor.

87
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,408
Why don't you try to live with her for a while

88
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,535
without telling her that you're her sister?

89
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,079
You can see how Kaori is doing now,

90
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,537
and discover the best thing for her.

91
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,648
I understand. I'll do it.

92
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,393
Excuse...

93
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,224
Quiet, the danger is coming.

94
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,699
I'm home! I'm home.

95
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,189
Ryo!

96
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,204
See, I told you.

97
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,877
Confetti 2

98
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,675
Confetti 2
Off-Timing Attack? You cheater!

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,081
What have you been doing with
Saeko until this late at night?

100
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,320
She asked me to work.

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,483
This is Sayuri Tachiki, the client.

102
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,925
And this woman with chain and sickle
is my assistant, Kaori Makimura.

103
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,055
Kaori?!

104
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,761
I can't believe this is...

105
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,573
So what? What kind of job request, Ryo?

106
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,846
What kind? Well...

107
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,805
I am the Chief Editor for the Weekly News.

108
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,052
Weekly News?

109
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,120
You mean...

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,289
The magazine which doesn't have
any articles about celebrities?

111
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,124
The famous magazine of news
with strong opinions?

112
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:38,724
That magazine?

113
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,358
Chief Editor?

114
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,359
You are?

115
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,485
Yes!

116
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,397
Excuse me?

117
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,491
Well, yes! She is that kind of person.

118
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:54,407
Recently, our headlines were on several
big enterprise scandals.

119
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,077
Then we received a ransom note and
threatening phone calls.

120
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,545
Finally, the office was robbed.

121
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,211
I contacted Ms. Nogami and I've
gotten to know Mr. Saeba.

122
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,085
Indeed, she is the Chief Editor.

123
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,087
She's good at making up stories like that.

124
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,489
I see.

125
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,357
Yes, that's what I wanted to tell you, Kaori.

126
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,025
This is an ordinary job, isn't it?

127
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,492
I guess so.

128
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,957
Oh, good. I'm stuffed!

129
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,237
Anyway, your cooking hasn't improved at all.

130
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,239
What? How can you say that
after you ate it all?

131
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:30,005
I need some good coffee after such a
horrible meal. Grind the beans.

132
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,814
Damn, what a big mouth.

133
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,250
Kaori, after coffee, prepare a bath please.

134
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,852
I'm out of shampoo.

135
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,954
Don't make the bath too hot.

136
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,023
Kaori, the coffee isn't ready yet?

137
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,083
I'm not here to be your mother or maid.

138
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,262
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to yell so loud.

139
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,027
Damn, I ground the beans a little too much.

140
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,105
Mr. Saeba!

141
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,699
You will take this responsibility
seriously, won't you?

142
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,747
Marriage! You intend to marry
my sister, don't you?

143
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,113
Oh, no way! You must be kidding!

144
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,379
How cruel! What kind of jerk are you?!

145
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,255
I'm sure that you tricked my sister
into taking care of you,

146
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,382
by deceiving her, didn't you?

147
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,426
Oh, poor Kaori.

148
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,294
I can't believe she was seduced by a cruel
man, both physically and mentally.

149
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,732
Hey! Don't misunderstand!

150
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,201
Our rooms are separate and our relationship
is not what you think!

151
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:33,297
First of all, why do you think I would
mokkori with a stranger?!

152
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,613
So sorry you don't get mokkori!

153
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,081
Then why don't you find a new assistant?!

154
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,481
You understand, don't you?
I can't win against her power.

155
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,190
Let's wait and see for a week anyway.

156
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,657
Ah, yes.


157
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,927
Excuse me, Kaori?

158
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,396
Why are you Mr. Saeba's assistant?

159
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,437
Does he force you to do it?

160
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,406
No way, I do this because I love it.

161
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,876
But you live with a man...

162
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,345
Don't worry.

163
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,438
Ryo doesn't consider me a woman.

164
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,415
Rather, you're in more danger than me.

165
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,285
Well, don't worry.

166
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,521
If he comes to you tonight, I will
protect you completely.

167
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,317
I see.

168
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,593
I guess Mr. Saeba is an absurd man.

169
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,061
I can't leave my sister in this environment.

170
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,162
I think I better bring her home and...

171
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,032
Wow, Sayuri in underwear! Mokkori!

172
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,771
Here comes the Peeping Tom!

173
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,739
My great abs!

174
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,681
Don't think you can use the same
method again and again.

175
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,586
What?

176
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,789
What?!

177
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,195
See, now you learn something.

178
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,665
If you don't want to experience
that again, never peep again!

179
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,496
The worst environment.

180
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,771
My whole body is aching.

181
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,005
I think the way I fell last night wasn't good.

182
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,070
Hey, Kaori, coffee.

183
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,119
Add milk at the end?

184
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,280
Yes, it's kind of surprising, isn't it?

185
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,189
Are you sure?

186
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,080
Please taste it.

187
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,295
Wow, really, it's so good!

188
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,797
See, I told you.

189
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,199
Hey, please tell me how you do it?

190
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,724
It's easy. At the end, you add...

191
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,134
I see, I didn't know that.

192
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,760
You mean I have to guard Ms. Sayuri?

193
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,831
Yes, please guard her completely
during her commute.

194
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,599
Good!

195
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,865
Good, I'm going to do a good job.
Trust me, Ms. Sayuri!

196
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,037
I'm nervous.

197
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,011
Idiot, too intense.

198
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,914
But she's not really in any
danger so it's okay.

199
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,310
What?

200
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,521
Kaori!

201
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,261
Watch out, Ms. Sayuri!

202
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,535
The blade?

203
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,608
Damn!

204
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,132
Wait! I'll get you!

205
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,501
Don't do it, it's too dangerous!

206
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,615
Ms. Sayuri?

207
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,149
Kaori's skills have improved, no doubt.


208
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,923
But is someone really trying to kill her?

Boss, can you check this article?

213
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,967
That article?

214
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,810
Let's see, this part needs
to be more concrete.

215
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,410
Yes, Ma'am.

216
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,112
These parts need to be summarized better.

217
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,046
Yes, Ma'am.

218
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,515
Boss, there's another ransom note.

219
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,005
Ransom note?

220
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,554
Oh, no, there are two mistakes
just in the address.

221
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,190
This person should study more seriously
before writing a letter.

222
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,885
I'll read it then.

223
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,561
What's the matter, Ms. Kaori?

224
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,461
Ms. Sayuri, you're incredible.

225
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,856
You look like a totally different person
when you sit at the desk.

226
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,793
You are indeed a real career woman.

227
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,467
I envy women like that,

228
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,034
because I can't be like that.

229
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,207
Sure you can, Ms. Kaori!

230
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,979
Yes, why don't you help me and work here?

231
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,617
That's a good idea! Why don't you
change careers and work here?

232
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,017
Well, Ms. Sayuri, you sound a little forceful.

233
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,555
I have to be forceful in this situation,

234
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,581
in order to get you out of such
a dangerous world!

235
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,964
Then please send this document by fax.

236
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,023
Instructions are written here.

237
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,769
I guess I am in a very strange situation.

238
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,033
I guess it's okay. This looks interesting.

239
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,544
Well, do this and this, and oh, it's so easy!

240
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,412
And then, turn the switch on.

241
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,279
What? Hey, hey, then, this way?

242
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,650
No way!

243
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,288
I can't imagine what you did to make
the fax machine explode?!

244
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,951
Boss, Ms. Makimura burnt the copier!


245
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,384
Boss, one of the computers has
been totally destroyed!

246
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:00,424
Boss, Ms. Makimura put the document
into the shredder!

247
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,269
Boss, Ms. Makimura destroyed
the word processor.

248
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,837
Ms. Makimura...

249
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:05,704
Boss!

250
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,940
What? What did she do this time?

251
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,309
There was a thief in the woman's
changing room!

252
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,901
Yours has been stolen too.

253
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,934
Boss!

254
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,521
What a failure.

255
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,923
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,256
This kind of work is not suitable
for me, I guess.

257
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,302
When I talked with Mr. Saeba,
I promised to wait a week,

258
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,466
but I think I ought to tell her the truth
and take her to my place.

259
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,811
What's the matter, Ms. Sayuri?

260
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,515
That ring...

261
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,177
Oh, this? This is a memento
of my late brother.

262
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,119
Your brother's?

263
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,957
My brother was an assistant for Ryo before.

264
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,258
He did that too?

265
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:03,285
Then you're doing it because it was your
brother's will to be Mr. Saeba's assistant?

266
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,766
It's not a lofty reason like that,

267
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,169
but I loved him so much,

268
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,138
and the only thing he left for me
was this ring and this job.

269
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:18,601
Also, my brother always said that
Ryo was an incredible man.

270
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,509
He was happy because he
could work with him.

271
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,417
My brother was a man of few words,
but he talked about him so much,

272
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,252
and I was interested.

273
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,243
I have been with him for a while,

274
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,160
so I think I understand what
my brother felt about Ryo.

275
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,492
And now, I don't want to quit this job.

276
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,303
Kaori, you look so beautiful now.

277
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,601
You look like you're so happy!

278
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,983
Manager, there's a Peeping Tom
in the changing room!

279
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,518
Some underwear was stolen!

280
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,719
What?!

281
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,121
An underwear thief?

282
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,349
Didn't that just happen in your office?

283
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,655
Why are there so many incidents today?

284
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,931
I'm home, Ryo!

285
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,399
Finally, you're home.

286
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,303
I'm so hungry, Kaori!

287
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,362
What happened here?

288
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,875
Why didn't you make your meal by yourself?

289
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,809
Oh, no!

290
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,970
You took off your best clothes
and left them lying around!

291
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,821
Ryo, what have you been doing
while I was out?!

292
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,222
When are you going to change
your bad habits?!

293
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,160
This underwear,

294
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,166
it's mine, that was stolen today
in the office changing room.

295
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,690
Why does Mr. Saeba have this?

296
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,437
Oh, no.

297
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,673
Boss, some underwear in the
changing room was stolen!

298
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,077
Manager, Peeping Tom!
Some underwear was stolen!

299
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,671
Why are there so many incidents today?

300
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,582
Ms. Kaori, please put me down.
Mr. Saeba,

301
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,018
Ms. Kaori, please put me down.
Were you following us all day because
you were worried about Kaori?

302
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,522
I'm not a bagworm!

303
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm not a bagworm!
I guess I better wait a bit
and see what happens.

304
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,119
Didn't I tell you that?

305
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,699
If you told me, I wouldn't have
called you like this!

306
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,998
You didn't tell me that Ms. Sayuri
really is in danger!

307
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,174
Because of that, I was half killed by Kaori,
and she made me a bagworm!

308
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,009
Are you listening to me, Saeko?!

309
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,772
Didn't Ms. Sayuri tell you?

310
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,149
She did.

311
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,284
Then, there's no problem.

312
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,487
Why didn't you believe what she told you?

313
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,788
Well, because...

314
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,792
I'm busy, so don't bother me with
such nonsense. All right? Bye.

315
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,783
Hey! Wait! Saeko!

316
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,997
Damn! Saeko always forces me
to do annoying things.

317
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,026
Kaori!

318
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,537
What?

319
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,576
No, you can't do something
dangerous like this!

320
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,311
Ms. Sayuri, please cut it out!

321
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,615
This is just shooting practice.
There is no danger!

322
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,984
No way! You don't need to do
things like this!

323
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,148
Jeez! I'm practicing in order
to protect you!

324
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,552
I see. I don't want you to protect me
if you need to do that!

325
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:25,023
That's the tool of murder!
You are practicing murder!

326
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,730
That's not true! This is to protect myself,
a necessary tool for my job.

327
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,639
Then quit it now! You're a woman.

328
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,699
I want you to be normal and more feminine!

329
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,082
Ms. Sayuri?

330
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,284
So close, but I couldn't see it.

331
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,828
Goodnight, brother.

332
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,309
Goodnight, Ms. Sayuri.

333
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,776
Goodnight.

334
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,325
It's the same ring as Kaori's, isn't it?

335
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,904
Mr. Saeba...

336
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,533
Makimura told me that the ring was
a memento of Kaori's mother.

337
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,134
Kaori's father said so right before
he passed away.

338
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,915
Our mother bought these rings
for each of us.

339
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:56,317
When my father took Kaori away,
he took one with him.

340
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,850
My mother's wish is sealed in those rings.

341
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,727
Our mother who loved two daughters
as much as she could.

342
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,231
She didn't want us to become great people,

343
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,636
but she wanted to raise us as normal women,
wanted us to grow up.

344
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:18,032
Grow up to be ordinary girls, and have
those rings look good on us.

345
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,879
Such a tiny wish, she sealed it into
those rings and gave them to us.

346
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,550
Mr. Saeba...

347
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,789
Why did you teach a girl how to use a gun?

348
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,358
Why did you drag her into this world?

349
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,656
Why did both you and Kaori's
brother do that?

350
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,163
I don't mind that she is a little masculine.

351
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,326
But what she's been doing can't be
right for a normal woman!

352
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,669
Do you think Kaori is happy living like this?

353
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,945
Which is happier for Kaori?

354
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,575
Are you saying that you already
know the answer?

355
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,425
There are two more days until
the end of the promise.

356
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,055
I'll wait until then.

357
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:17,069
Guitar o kikase ta katta

358
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,766
Ai o todoke ta katta

359
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:26,667
Omoi ga tsutae rare na katta

360
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:37,180
Boku ga sumu kono machi o,
kimi wa nani mo shiranai

361
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:43,583
Boku ga koko ni iru wake sae mo

362
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:58,510
Moshi, ano toki ga, furui renga no machi
nami ni somaru kotoga dekite itara

363
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,877
Kimi o hanasa na katta

364
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:10,152
Fuyu no hizashi o ukeru kouen o yoko gitte

365
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:16,394
Mainichi no seikatsu ga hajimaru

366
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:26,670
Toki ga tomatta mama no boku no kokoro o

367
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:33,010
Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

368
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,920
I've become quite fit for the work, haven't I?


369
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,022
I escaped by myself when I was kidnapped.

370
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,491
Excuse me, but can't you be more graceful?

371
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,260
The enemy is scared of you.

372
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,496
Well, it's okay. Ms. Sayuri's safe,
so the case is over now!

373
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,293
No, the real solution hasn't appeared yet.

374
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,634
She has something to tell you.

375
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,903
Ms. Sayuri does? I see, but what is it?

376
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,171
City Hunter 2:

377
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,641
"Reunion After Twenty Years! Please Look
After My Sister, Mr. Saeba. (Part 2)"

378
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,438
If you miss it, I'm going to go far away!

379
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,568
Please look forward to the next episode
