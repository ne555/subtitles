1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:16,049
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:25,481
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,795
Lady in the middle of the night,
blended in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:41,399
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,379
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,711
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,686
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,985
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:05,031
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:12,072
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:19,679
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:29,645
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:48,074
3 PM, I'll be waiting on the rooftop
of the Sun City building.

14
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,133
H. Makimura...

15
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,335
H. Makimura?

16
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,846
Hideyuki Makimura...

17
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,574
My brother?!

18
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:01,676
Message from Makimura
Memories Forever
(Part 1)

19
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,468
No way.

20
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,436
No way! The client can't be my brother!

21
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,066
There's just no way.

22
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,971
Brother?!

23
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,055
Kaori Makimura, aren't you?

24
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,256
Yes!

25
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,226
I know you have something from
your late brother Makimura.

26
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,761
I want you to give it to me.

27
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,596
Something from my brother?

28
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,731
It's not good for you if you hide it.

29
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,833
What am I hiding?

30
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,266
H. Makimura...

31
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,302
Ryo!

32
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,199
If it's a joke, it's a bad one.

33
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,036
City Hunter, Ryo Saeba, aren't you?

34
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,476
Who the hell are you?

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,551
I'm not a dangerous man.

36
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,178
I want to show you something that will
solve our misunderstanding.

37
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,959
International Criminal Police Organization,

38
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,426
Interpol...

39
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,166
Narcotics squad agent, Kelly Nelson.

40
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,135
What does a narcotics squad
agent want from Kaori?

41
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,341
We are trying to find the drugs
Makimura smuggled in.

42
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,075
What?!

43
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,643
Smuggling drugs?

44
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,940
My brother?

45
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,747
It's a huge amount.

46
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,781
Excuse me.

47
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,817
I don't care if you are from
Interpol or whatever,

48
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,986
but I won't forgive you for
insulting my brother.

49
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,388
Why would my brother smuggle drugs?!

50
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,691
He was a detective and he hated drugs!

51
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,694
Former detectives sometimes
get involved in crime.

52
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,529
It's not all that rare.

53
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,723
My brother is different!

54
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:30,670
Fortunately, there's no trace of the
drugs he smuggled in Japan,

55
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,607
because he died in an accident
before he sold them.

56
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,472
Well, he was murdered, wasn't he?

57
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,678
Let me tell you something.

58
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,670
I don't have anything from my brother.

59
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,712
It might be mixed up in your belongings
while you don't know.

60
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,588
Why don't you check my apartment then?!

61
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,885
You can go ahead and search
as much as you want.

62
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,091
That's a good idea.

63
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,355
Well, I was intending to do so anyway.

64
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:11,073
I already called some help but it
looks like they haven't got here.

65
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,979
Help?

66
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,504
A person you know very well.

67
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,253
Well, this is my room.

68
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,914
Search as much as you want to!

69
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:23,852
Wait, Kaori!

70
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,534
Saeko?!

71
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,202
I didn't know you were already
here, Ms. Nogami.

72
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,329
Oh, no, what's going on?!

73
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,977
I see.

74
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,844
The Metropolitan Police are also
involved in this matter.

75
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,841
Interpol has officially requested us.

76
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,821
I was ordered to cooperate with
Nelson as much as I can.

77
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,257
This is too much for a domestic
search, isn't it?

78
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,594
The place was like this when I got here.

79
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,891
This was done by them.

80
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,603
"Red Pegasus," Red Pegasus...

81
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,138
Red Pegasus?

82
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,540
Is that who killed my brother?!

83
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,007
What do you think, Ryo?

84
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,743
It was an organization for smuggling drugs.

85
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,247
But you ruined them, didn't you?

86
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,116
I guess there were some survivors.

87
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,643
They've re-established the organization and
found the drugs Makimura smuggled in.

88
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,423
Saeko, it's a lie that my brother
smuggled drugs, isn't it?!

89
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,891
It's has to be!

90
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,725
Kaori, it's a fact that there were doubts
about what Makimura did.

91
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,298
You don't believe in my brother, do you?

92
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,397
Of course, I want to believe.

93
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,169
Kaori!

94
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,571
That's enough!

95
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,806
Get out of here, all of you!

96
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,343
I'm sure the people who searched
my place didn't find anything.

97
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,378
There were no drugs from
the very beginning.

98
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,245
It's not an established fact that
my brother smuggled drugs.

99
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,499
Brother...

100
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,334
Nice music.

101
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,704
It's one my brother loved.

102
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,171
Makimura did?

103
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,228
The ring... to Kaori...

104
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,998
Kaori, please take care of her...

105
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,286
I can't stand the fact that my
brother is a suspect.

106
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,521
I feel sorry for my brother and he's dead!

107
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,431
Ryo, why didn't you say anything?

108
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,830
How can you be so calm?

109
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,662
I believe in Makimura.

110
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,518
Gilmore.

111
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,355
Yes, my followers searched that
apartment thoroughly,

112
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,380
but couldn't find anything like that.

113
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,825
What about you?

114
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,101
Anyway, I'm sure that Makimura's sister must
have some kind of key to this matter.

115
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,337
Why don't you kidnap her
and make her confess?

116
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,674
No, Makimura's sister is not the only
one we have to deal with.

117
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,842
Are you talking about Ryo Saeba?

118
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,078
We have to be as careful as we can.

119
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,511
I'll contact you again later.

120
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,848
What a wimp!

121
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,451
Sorry to keep you waiting, Falcon.

122
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,028
I don't have as much free time as you think.

123
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,461
Hurry up and tell me what you want.

124
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,466
Exactly like your reputation.
You're curt to a fault.

125
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,968
None of your business!

126
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,171
Well, do you want to earn some money?

127
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,839
Earn money?

128
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,607
Tell me how.

129
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,342
It's simple.

130
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,869
What you need to do is to join our
organization, Red Pegasus.

131
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,869
Red Pegasus!

132
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,415
We'll welcome you!

133
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,421
Wait!

134
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,945
You don't like this idea?

135
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,526
It sounds good!

136
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,963
However, there's something
behind a good story.

137
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,521
Let me think about it for a while.

138
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,872
He's pompous.

139
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,171
Well, I guess I'll wait for good news.

140
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,481
RN Private Detective

141
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,215
You want to see the Metropolitan Police
Department records on Makimura?

142
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes!

143
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,255
I want to investigate my brother from the
time he was a detective until he died.

144
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:01,293
It might be faster to go to the Metro Police
Department and ask my sister.

145
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,887
No! I know Saeko won't help me.

146
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:11,134
Well, I guess I'll help you, but
can you do me a favor then?

147
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,838
What favor?

148
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm going to get the documents

149
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,809
so can you give me the position
of being Saeba's partner?

150
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,715
I'm just kidding.

151
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,479
I know you can't do anything like that.

152
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,753
All right.

153
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,323
I said all right, but you have to get me
all the information on my brother.

154
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,449
All of it.

155
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,994
Are you serious?

156
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,344
Well, what is the stance of the
Metropolitan Police Department?

157
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,513
As long as we're looking at the
information from Interpol,

158
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,481
Makimura's a suspect.

159
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,249
But even if Makimura smuggled drugs,
we don't understand why.

160
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,322
Why don't you investigate it?

161
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,780
I want to, but the higher-ups haven't
given me permission to do so.

162
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,764
Because of Interpol, they put me in
a special investigations position,

163
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,533
but honestly speaking, they don't want
to get involved with this matter.

164
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,936
A drug scandal with a former detective...

165
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,166
It's going to be the best kind of
news for the newspaper.

166
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,214
Did you finish your secret
conversation, Ms. Nogami?

167
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,349
Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,151
I was getting some information from him.

169
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,118
Mr. Saeba...

170
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,889
Let me tell you something so you'll
understand me a little better.

171
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:41,917
I hate drugs, but I don't have any bad
feelings towards Makimura himself.

172
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,299
While Makimura was a detective,
he and I brought down

173
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,097
an international drug smuggling
organization together.

174
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,471
He was a good detective.

175
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,141
I heard about Makimura's sudden death
while I was in New York.

176
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,311
I was shocked to hear that.

177
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,814
Now, another incident this time.

178
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:05,181
Do you understand how I feel, Mr. Saeba?

179
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,285
We both are having a tough time.

180
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,564
Makimura...

181
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,362
What were you trying to do?

182
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,175
Gazelle

183
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,810
Here you go.

184
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,281
This is all the information
regarding Makimura

185
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,873
from the Metropolitan Police
Department and Interpol.

186
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,011
I had a difficult time borrowing them
without letting my sister know.

187
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,987
Thank you.

188
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,955
I promise I'll pay you back for this someday.

189
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,826
This is a no parking zone.

190
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,196
What?

191
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,273
Damn you!

192
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,205
Calm down!

193
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,440
Go home and tell your boss.

194
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:11,073
I'll throw Red Pegasus into Hell
again and again.

195
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,618
Listen.

196
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:16,452
Next time you come close to
my partner, you'll die.

197
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,157
What is your answer?

198
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,624
Yes, Sir. I understand, Sir!

199
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,542
Baby-sitting is a tough job, isn't it?

200
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,819
Was the late Makimura involved
in this matter?

201
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,820
Yes...

202
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,287
I see.

203
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,495
What are you doing, Ryo?

204
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,689
Hi, Reika.

205
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,165
I see.

206
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,768
You care about Kaori, don't you?

207
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,498
Well, you don't need to worry about
her because she's strong.

208
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,239
Sorry to cause you problems.

209
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:13,138
It's not like you, Ryo, to say things
like that with such a serious face.

210
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,981
Honestly speaking, I haven't done anything.

211
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,109
My sister let me borrow the
information about Makimura.

212
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,888
I have something to ask you to investigate.

213
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,355
Can you?

214
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,058
A favor for you, Ryo?

215
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,126
Sure.

216
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,560
I'll do it for a good price,
not like my sister.

217
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,697
It's raining.

218
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,224
It's bad.

219
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,428
According to the information from Interpol,

220
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,454
it is more than certain that my
brother smuggled drugs.

221
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,526
We may need to accept that fact.

222
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,835
Ryo...

223
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:16,241
But Makimura is not one who
would sell his soul to evil.

224
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,799
I know there's some reason for it.

225
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,178
Yes, I'm sure there's some reason.

226
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,722
The Metropolitan Police Department,
Special Investigations Division...

227
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,485
Mr. Hideyuki Makimura...

228
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,659
This is a New Year's card delivered
to his office this year.

229
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,094
They don't know he's no longer a
detective nor that he's dead.

230
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,802
Mr. Makimura, how are you?

231
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,972
Please hurry up and come to see us.
Play with us as you used to do.

232
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,530
From all at the Kurumi House...

233
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,804
My brother was the kind of man
who visited an orphanage.

234
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,780
An orphanage...

235
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,317
Why don't we visit there tomorrow?

236
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,823
The kids don't know Makimura
can't visit them, do they?

237
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,690
I feel sorry for them, not knowing about it
and waiting for him forever.

238
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,988
I guess so.

239
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,229
Orphans...

240
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,242
Did you say something?

241
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,368
No...

242
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,440
It was about twenty years ago.

243
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,087
My father, who was a police officer,
brought a baby home.

244
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,554
And he told me...

245
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,219
This baby is your younger sister
from now on.

246
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,553
That was Kaori.

247
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:47,258
She was the daughter of a criminal who died
by accident while my father was chasing him.

248
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,760
Her mother had passed away a long time
ago, so my father adopted her.

249
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,143
My father sometimes murmured mournfully
while looking at this ring,

250
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:02,011
which was a memento of Kaori's mother.

251
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,118
He said that he would give this ring
to Kaori with the truth

252
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,881
when she turned twenty years old.

253
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,690
But my father died five years later,

254
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,659
and his part was passed on me.

255
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,653
Today, I have to tell her the truth
with this ring.

256
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,328
It's been a year and a half since then.

257
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,311
I accepted the role of telling Kaori the truth,

258
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,279
but I haven't done anything yet.

259
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,175
I'm sorry, Makimura.

260
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,629
Ryo! Behind us!

261
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,623
Idiot! You're going to hit me!

262
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,138
Jerk! This is not a movie
directed by Spielberg!

263
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,138
Ryo, here it comes again!

264
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,810
We're safe!

265
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,244
What the hell was that truck?!

266
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,552
Run, Kaori!

267
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,098
Oh, my, so many people.

268
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:04,000
Ryo Saeba, I've heard that you took care
of my followers yesterday.

269
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,806
You're the leader of Red Pegasus, aren't you?

270
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,707
You came back from Hell to
kill me, didn't you?

271
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,715
Sure, if I kill you, lots of my friends
in Hell will be very happy.

272
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,417
However, I won't kill you now.

273
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:23,184
I have many things to ask you and the girl.

274
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,565
What is this? Tear gas?

275
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,032
Ryo!

276
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,771
Kaori!

277
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,604
Everything will turn out just fine for them
if we don't do something now.

278
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,313
Damn!

279
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,253
Give up, Saeba!

280
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,098
What the hell?!

281
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,111
Umibozu!

282
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,408
Get in!

283
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,544
You jerk, Falcon!

284
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:38,461
Damn, Falcon! This is your answer, isn't it?

285
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,847
How is your partner?

286
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,483
She inhaled a little tear gas.

287
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,145
She will wake up in three or four hours.

288
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,823
You'd been followed by them for a
long time but you didn't realize it.

289
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,290
Something's wrong with you this time.

290
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:33,217
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

291
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,656
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

292
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,387
You skip dinner and eat diet food

293
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:48,526
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

294
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,938
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

295
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,271
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

296
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:03,375
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

297
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:12,454
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

298
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,359
Don't you, don't you know

299
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:20,732
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

300
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:28,571
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

301
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:34,471
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

302
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:43,789
Red Pegasus, you kidnapped me and
where the hell are you taking me?!

303
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,591
They are desperately seeking
the smuggling route.

304
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,593
He left something, didn't he?

305
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,494
I'm sure.

306
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,463
But I don't have any clue to it.

307
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,298
They don't believe that.

308
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,533
Don't let your guard down, Kaori!

309
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,161
Brother, please, please guide me.

310
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,937
City Hunter 2:

311
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,407
"Message from Makimura
Memories Forever (Part 2)"

312
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,034
Don't ever miss the show!

313
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,268
Please look forward to the next episode
