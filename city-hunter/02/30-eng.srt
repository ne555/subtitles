Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:25,481
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:33,795
Mayonaka no lady, hitogomi ni magire

00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:41,399
Utsurigi na steppin' kurikaeshite iru

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,379
Tsuyogari no face, tough na furi de

6

Odori akashite mo

00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,686
Sono hitomi wa kodoku na iro

00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,985

Oh, Sarah, akirame nai de,

Oh, Sarah, sono omoi o, wasurezu ni ite

00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:19,679
Oh, Sarah, mayowa nai de,
motto kanjiru mama ni

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:29,645
Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,413
Are you all right?

14
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,606
Where are you going in such
a hurry, little girl?

15
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:02,322
Papa forgot to take the lunch I made for him.

16
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,190
He does that all the time.

17
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,317
I have to hurry or he might be gone!

18
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,024
Papa!

19
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,487
Pull yourself together!

20
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,450
Papa...

21
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,454
What a cruel thing.

22
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,664
I won't forgive the person who did this!

23
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:49,624
Ryo, Please be Deceived
Present to a Girl From Saeko

24
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,839
This month, there have been
three explosions,

25
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,440
and at about the same time
as these explosions,

26
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,807
three banks have been attacked.

27
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,879
Exactly.

28
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,016
I'm sure all these acts were committed
by the same person.

29
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,685
This is a picture of Sawamura, isn't it?

30
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,421
Yes, I suspect he's the one who played
the main role in these incidents.

31
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,457
However, he hasn't given himself away.

32
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,290
Chief, let me handle this.

33
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,396
Wait a second.

34
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,332
You've been investigating the corruption case
and come to a deadlock, haven't you?

35
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,867
I won't approve such a selfish action!

36
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,358
Chief, there's lipstick on your collar!

37
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,774
I won't tell your wife about it.

38
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,275
Thank you.

39
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,312
Hey, Detective Nogami, what
are you talking about?!

40
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,576
Wait a second, there's no
lipstick on my collar!

41
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,451
Papa, I have to take this lunch box to Papa.

42
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,124
Papa is here!

43
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,591
Pull yourself together!

44
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,565
The investigators have concluded that
these crimes were committed by

45
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,401
the same person since the same modus
operandi was used in all of them.

46
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,204
However, it looks like they
tricked the authorities

47
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,207
and attacked a bank right before
it opened this morning.

48
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,674
Also, this crime is...

49
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:10,516
I can't believe a person would steal
ordinary people's money.

50
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,747
Why don't these criminals think about
earning money through honest work?

51
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,257
Speaking of honest work, I almost forgot.

52
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,725
One person here doesn't have any
intention of doing serious work.

53
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,989
Hey, Kaori, the phone is ringing.

54
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,369
Pick it up yourself.

55
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,998
What the hell is she mad about?

56
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,905
Hello, Saeba Company.

57
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,514
This is Saeko. I have a favor to ask.

58
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,383
If you're asking me to work for you,
the answer's no.

59
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,252
You owe me countless rolls in the hay.

60
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,787
You're so cold, aren't you?

61
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,381
I just want you to comfort me.

62
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,625
You mean you want to mokkori
with me, don't you?

63
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,127
Then why didn't you say so?!

64
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,061
Of course, I'll be right there.

65
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,555
Finally, I can mokkori with Saeko.

66
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,096
Who was that?

67
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,106
It was a wrong number.

68
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,132
Well, I just remembered I have
something to do, so see you.

69
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,746
He looks suspicious somehow.

70
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,120
It's time.

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,951
We're gonna rush in at the
moment of the explosion.

72
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,383
Yes, Sir.

73
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,705
Almost all work requests are from Saeko,

74
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,434
so my savings are constantly
decreasing these days.

75
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,776
First of all, Ryo spoils her so much!

76
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,810
What the hell?!

77
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,790
An explosion?

78
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,257
Don't move!

79
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,563
Hands up everybody!

80
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,931
Put the money into the bag!

81
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,398
Hurry up!

82
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,396
Give me that!

83
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,271
My poor money!

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,913
You bastard thief!

85
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,380
Give it back to me!

86
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,646
Thief!

87
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,671
You dressed up just for me.

88
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,446
What a simple mind!

89
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,518
Here we are.

90
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,153
Hurry up, hurry up!

91
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,988
You're impatient as usual.

92
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,991
Why don't we have a drink for now?

93
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,652
Sure!

94
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,865
Love begins with cocktails
for both of us, right?

95
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,137
What is that?

96
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,604
Lyrics from a song.

97
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,841
How did it come off?

98
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,251
The final bank robbery has been completed.

99
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:36,210
If they're on time, the money will be
brought to the ship in one hour.

100
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,271
Sorry to keep you waiting.

101
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,796
Stop following me around like this.

102
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,544
How long do you intend to stand there
like that with a stupid face?

103
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,846
You're in the way.

104
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:00,938
Get out!

105
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,875
What's the matter with you all of a sudden?!

106
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,652
I hate pushy men like you.

107
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,119
Excuse me?

108
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,058
You look like you're in trouble.

109
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,428
Shall I kick this rude man out of here?

110
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,096
Would you?

111
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,563
It's my pleasure.

112
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,327
Anyway, I can't believe there's a man
dressed so disgracefully nowadays.

113
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,174
None of your business.

114
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,074
You should realize the value of originality.

115
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,612
That's too nice a way to describe yourself.

116
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,415
In your case, you look like you wear
only designer labels, don't you?

117
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,817
Of course.

118
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,621
For example, this six button double-breasted
jacket is a Brooks Brothers.

119
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,248
The dress shirt is a Paul Stewart.

120
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:48,761
And instead of a necktie, I use an ascot scarf
with a paisley print to decorate my collar.

121
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,962
I see.

122
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,632
Why don't you put price tags on each item?

123
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,724
What the hell?

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,698
Gentlemen shouldn't get violent
in front of a lady.

125
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,166
Well, Saeko doesn't like me any more,
so I guess I am going home.

126
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,282
What a rude guy he was, wasn't he?

127
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,484
Thank you. You saved me.

128
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,885
Why don't we take that table over there
and have a drink together?

129
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,422
I don't think so.

130
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,250
You're not my type.

131
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,663
Stop kidding around.

132
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,290
I came to help you.

133
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,536
Excuse me, Sir.

134
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,436
This is from your companion.

135
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,179
I said I hate pushy men.

136
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,943
Anyway, goodbye.

137
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,355
I can't believe she rejected me.

138
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:54,054
However, the more she rejects me,
the more I want her.

139
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,897
I wonder if Ryo got mad?

140
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,346
Damn...

141
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,182
How can she let herself be kidnapped
ostentatiously like that?

142
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,515
Well, it's Saeko so I knew
something was going on.

143
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,621
If I hadn't seen this, I would've gone home.

144
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,056
Wait outside!!
If I hadn't seen this, I would've gone home.

145
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,024
Wait outside!!

146
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,775
I want to have a party now.

147
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,504
I don't think I'm invited.

148
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,469
I take the things I want.

149
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,149
That's my way.

150
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,480
You are forceful, aren't you?

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,422
How about becoming my partner?

152
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,724
I'll buy you anything you want.

153
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,056
I promise I won't bore you.

154
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,959
What a success!

155
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,135
Well, let me think for a little while.

156
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,603
Sure, I expect to get a nice answer.

157
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,200
Escort her to her room.

158
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,846
Let me go! I said, let go!

159
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,347
It hurts!

160
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,314
Shut up!
It hurts!

161
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,042
Shut up!



162
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,809
Jerk, let me go!

163
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,520
What's going on?

164
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
Who the hell is this man?

165
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,656
Did you call me a man?!

166
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,419
I am NOT...

167
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,860
Boss...

168
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,661
What?!

169
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,163
You were followed by her?!

170
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,698
I'm sorry, boss.

171
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,266
What an idiot!

172
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,501
I'll decide what to do about that woman later.

173
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,704
For now, put her in the hold.

174
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,103
Yes, Sir.

175
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,778
Why the hell is Kaori in a place like this?

176
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:09,088
Boss, I have a feeling that woman
is not to be trusted.

177
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,598
Well, do you want to throw
cold water on my hobby?

178
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,361
No, I didn't mean that.

179
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,837
Anyway, our business is getting
close at hand.

180
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,532
Turn the ship to the promontory.

181
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,372
Yes, Sir.

182
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,746
I wonder where they're going?

183
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,646
I don't think I have time to stay here
without doing anything.

184
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,783
Ryo...

185
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,920
You'd better not do anything
without making a plan.

186
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,489
Let me handle it.

187
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,124
Do you know who they are?

188
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:44,330
Yes, I saw men carrying boxes
full of cash onto this boat.

189
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,060
Then I guess they robbed another
bank somewhere.

190
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:53,937
I thought so, but I was wondering why
you fumbled this. It's not like you.

191
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,142
You already found the stolen money

192
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,542
so why did you put yourself into the
situation like this as a decoy?

193
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,077
I'm not chasing them just for bank robbery.

194
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,529
I can't stand their dirty tricks.

195
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,769
May I come in?

196
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,339
Wait a second.

197
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,378
Come in.

198
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,982
I thought I heard somebody talking in here.

199
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,110
I sometimes talk to myself.

200
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,852
I see.

201
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,756
By the way, what is your answer
to my question?

202
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,162
Is something wrong with this sofa?

203
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,531
That's right.

204
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,033
The answer...

205
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,802
I was thinking it's not a bad idea to
live on a gorgeous yacht like this.

206
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,104
Then your answer is okay, isn't it?

207
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,401
Oh, no.

208
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,275
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,936
I guess I was too hasty, wasn't I?

210
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:10,041
I am sorry, but there are lots of things
to think about for a woman.

211
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,411
I think we need to understand
each other a bit better.

212
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,945
We'll enjoy things after that.

213
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,348
Later, my honey.

214
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,206
Hey, let me out of here!

215
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,403
If you don't, I'm going to make a hole
in the bottom of the boat and sink it!

216
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,268
Let me out!

217
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,938
Shut your mouth!

218
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,282
I see.

219
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,840
Now, I have an idea.

220
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,189
No, stop.

221
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,325
Please! No! Stop!

222
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,627
No! No!

223
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,925
Oh, no, don't do things like that!

224
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,192
No! Stop!

225
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,531
Give me my 100,000 yen!

226
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,871
Damn, this guy is useless.

227
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,841
Now, I'm going to get my money back
no matter what happens.

228
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,353
Where the hell did Kaori go?

229
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,604
A time bomb...

230
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,939
I see.

231
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,907
This is like the one used at the bank.

232
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,569
Well, I don't think I can let Ryo
handle this matter by himself.

233
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,869
I found it!

234
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,180
Damn!

235
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,022
Damn! She's a bitch just as I thought.

236
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,299
I feel sick.

237
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,766
I guess I got seasick.

238
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,229
Watch out! Run!

239
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,004
Saeko!

240
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,443
What a coincidence, meeting you
in a place like this.

241
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,178
Saeko is here.

242
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,645
Which means Ryo also might be here?

243
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,513
Let me handle this and escape from here!

244
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:03,789
Got it.

245
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,256
Just as I thought.

246
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,027
Damn, did we let her go?

247
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,395
She betrayed me?

248
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,970
She made a fool out of me. I won't forget that.

249
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,462
She has a companion, a skillful man.

250
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,837
The situation has changed my excessive
tenderness to hundredfold hatred.

251
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,912
Well, the boat is about to arrive
at the promontory.

252
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,650
I see.

253
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,821
Well, we are at sea and there's
no place to escape to.

254
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,790
After my business is over, I'll finish
them once and for all.

255
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,215
This is it.

256
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,583
Are you ready for yours?

257
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,118
Of course.

258
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,755
Machine guns, grenades and rifles.
You can choose whatever you want.

259
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,383
In exchange for the money, you can
take them onto your boat.

260
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,478
Done.

261
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,559
This is the last one.

262
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,194
Good, later.

263
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,130
Trust is the number one key in our business.

264
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,798
We have to say goodbye now.

265
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,265
No, you can't.

266
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,695
Freeze, both of you.

267
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,868
Who the hell are you?

268
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
Metropolitan Police, Special Investigations
Team, Saeko Nogami.

269
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,478
I can't imagine you're a cop.

270
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,247
Damn, I can't believe what I've done.

271
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,216
Mr. Sawamura, you're a philanderer.

272
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,819
The only thing I was worrying about was that!

273
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,945
Damn!

274
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,327
Stop struggling and give up.

275
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,396
I didn't know you were there.

276
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,863
I don't care. Kill him!

277
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,605
Give my 100,000 yen back!

278
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,742
Kaori, you're too close to fire.

279
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,676
You'll just scare them.

280
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,811
Stuff happens.

281
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,511
What the hell is this?! Hurry up and escape!

282
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,886
Wow, I feel good now.

283
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,822
Well, I might have a potential for
danger in my nature.

284
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,104
The good looking man is ruined now.

285
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,272
Look at him.

286
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,075
Saeko, you don't look like yourself.

287
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,509
Do you have a grudge against this man?

288
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:20,352
Well, no matter how hard we torture him,
he wouldn't understand

289
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,149
how sad that girl felt.

290
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,422
That girl?

291
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,395
My 100,000 yen is gone!

292
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,863
Give it back to me!

293
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,600
Don't worry about it, Kaori.

294
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,898
Saeko will get it back for you later.

295
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,365
What's wrong?!

296
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,033
The engine room is destroyed.

297
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,935
Hurry and stop the leak!

298
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,770
Damn! What the hell is this?!

299
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,829
It's sinking, sinking!

300
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,175
Get the pay from her, all right?

301
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,836
Trust me!

302
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,440
Mokkori
Drink

303
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,409
I'm full of energy! Mokkori!

304
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,856
Miss...

305
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,164
You look like you're so much better now.

306
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,598
Because you come to see me every day.

307
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,735
You're very good at compliments.

308
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,338
Here, I have a present for you today.

309
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,273
Wow, great!

310
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,574
A lunch box!

311
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:54,479
You'll recover quickly and make a
delicious lunch for your father. Right?

312
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,946
Sure!

313
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,541
Now I understand what was going on.

314
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,081
I guess I have to forget about
a loan for this time.

315
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:33,283
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

Don't you, don't you know

Wakatte yo, chotto benkyo surya wakaru yo

327
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,752
Regarding being a guard
for Princess Angela,

328
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,254
I'm going to pair up with Robert.

329
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,021
Robert?

330
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,056
I used to work with him before.

331
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,925
It's good since he's in the same
business as we are.

332
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,593
Guarding the princess will be perfect.

333
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,661
Also, he looks like he's a gentleman.

334
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,329
However, he's a dangerous guy.

335
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,831
He's as skilled as I am.

336
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,433
Ryo, you can't lose.

337
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,367
Of course not.

338
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,235
I'm the first to do mokkori with the princess.

339
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,537
I'm not telling you to do a
good job in that area.

340
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,471
City Hunter 2:

341
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,674
"So Long, My Friend
The Last Shot Echoing in My Heart (Part 1)"

342
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,198
If you don't watch it, I'm going to
hit you with my hammer.

343
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,211
Please look forward to the next episode
