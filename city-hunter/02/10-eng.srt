Shining smile, isogazu ni arinomama, kiss

12
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,174
The Dukedom of Celigena is a small
country in the Middle East.

13
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,882
So what's the purpose of
Princess Alma visiting Japan?

14
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,550
It's a custom of the country, I've heard.

15
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,087
Before someone ascends the throne,
he travels all over the world.

16
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,247
I see.

17
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,920
By the way, how old is the princess?
Is she beautiful?

18
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,761
I have no idea. There is no information at all.

19
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,820
Oh, my God!

20
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:16,861
Princess... Princess Alma disappeared
with her lady-in-waiting!

21
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:21,996
Mokkori Killer?!
The Princess's Noble Aura
(Part 1)

22
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,902
Princess Alma of the Dukedom of Celigena,
disappeared with a lady-in-waiting?!

23
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,649
All they know is that the princess
wears a bracelet

24
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,484
with the crest of the royal family on it.

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,019
It says the police don't even
know what she looks like,

26
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,182
so the police are urging them to
have a portrait of her made.

27
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,457
If someone finds the princess,
I'm sure a reward would be paid!

28
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:45,892
Well, even with a small country like that, she
is the princess so the reward would be high!

29
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,325
I'm not going to spend time like this.
I'm going to find her!

30
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,706
I'm sure the reward would cover not only
the entire wedding expenses,

31
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:58,143
but also a sweet home for Ryo and me!
Just for the two of us!

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,343
Whose sweet home did you just say?

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,350
How dare she say things like that?!

34
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,354
Searching for the princess,
I wonder if I could do that?

35
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,522
You also want to have money for
your wedding, don't you?

36
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,635
Kaori, you want to see someone
from the imperial family,

37
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,271
with whom we ordinary people have
nothing to do, just once, don't you?

38
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,435
Of course, there aren't many chances to do
mokkori with a person like that, right?

39
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,510
Exactly! It's one of the dreams of men
to mokkori with a noble person!

40
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,686
It's the only thing on your mind, isn't it?

41
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,223
Shoot!

42
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,295
Hello? Yes, who is this?

43
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,630
Princess!

44
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,619
RYO!

45
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,900
Oh, well, I need to go to the restroom.

46
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,892
I'm not even thinking about going to
search for the princess, no...

47
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,839
Phone for you.

48
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,938
From Princess Alma, asking you
to be her bodyguard.

49
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,590
Where is she? Where on Earth
is my Princess Alma?

50
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,490
Are you sure this is the place?

51
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,056
If you don't believe me, you can go home!

52
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,606
Wow! Wow, mokkori!

53
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,277
Nice to meet you. I'm the one who called...


54
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,507
Princess Alma! I know that!

55
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,847
Well, I...

56
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,371
She is my lady-in-waiting, Salina.

57
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,083
I am the princess.

58
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,685
Where is the voice coming from?

59
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,354
Idiot! Down here.

60
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,821
Down?

61
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,249
A kid?!

62
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,117
You're calling the princess a kid?! Insolent!


63
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,995
OUCH!

64
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:06,266
Oh, this is the bracelet with the
crest of the imperial family!

65
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,073
Now, you understand that I am
the princess, don't you?

66
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,813
The princess will ascend the throne
after she finishes this trip,

67
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,145
and she won't ever leave
the country after that.

68
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,845
Therefore, she wants to relax,
without any of her retainers.


69
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,487
Please help us to make the best of this
once in a lifetime opportunity.

70
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,825
What a great story. Also, the pay is good.

71
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,758
I won't baby-sit for a kid who kicked
the most important part of a man!

72
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:37,866
Ryo!

73
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,072
Wait a second.

74
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,106
What?

75
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,573
Come here a second!

76
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,775
Just a second!

77
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:53,452
What a cheerful princess! Please kick me
as much as you want to!

78
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,013
Your Highness, what did you tell Ryo?

79
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,225
I told him that I'd make a harem
in my country for him.

80
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,596
Exactly as I guessed.

81
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,568
Excuse me, your highness,
I have one more favor.

82
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,569
What is it?

83
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,266
Can you add your lady-in-waiting,
Salina, to my harem please?

84
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,711
Well, I guess.

85
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,201
Princess?!

86
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,849
Wow, what a pleasure!

87
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,316
However,

88
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,489
the laws of my country forbid for
a man who is given a harem

89
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,890
to have contact with any of the women
until he actually moves in there.

90
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,429
If you do anything lecherous,
you will be disqualified

91
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,896
from having a harem at that point.

92
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,798
Understood?

93
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,302
Yes, I am the best man at keeping
promises in all of Japan.

94
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,869
My head has started hurting.

95
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,839
Well, please make yourselves at home.
It's a little messy though.

96
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,808
Sure, this place is really messy.

97
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:04,323
Anyway, you must both be hot and sweaty.
Why don't you take a shower?

98
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,592
Hey! Don't you want a harem?

99
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,494
Oh, no. I can't even touch?

100
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,369
Then it's okay to peek.

101
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,510
Wait for me, Salina!

102
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,137
Don't you want a harem?

103
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,472
I thought that not touching was okay.

104
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,411
In my country, peeking is punishable
by the death penalty.

105
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,016
Well, after the shower, how about a
massage, Japanese style?

106
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,194
Harem!

107
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:46,222
Excuse me, but the massage after a
shower is performed by a man!

108
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,656
Such a liar!

109
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,227
Salina, these stairs are steep so
I will take your hand.

110
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,871
Harem!

111
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,808
Ms. Salina, you're tired, aren't you?

112
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,742
Why don't you sip some brandy and
have a good night's sleep?

113
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,400
Harem!

114
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,039
Damn!

115
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,453
What a little rat!

116
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,588
I think I won't be needing this.
What a little rat!

117
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,213
I think I won't be needing this.

118
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,593
Well, it's okay. I'll just wait until
the princess falls asleep.

119
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,324
Then, I'm going to sneak into the room
where Salina is sleeping.

120
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,370
The princess is sound asleep, but...

121
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,570
I can't believe the princess and a
lady-in-waiting sleep in the same bed?!

122
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,103
I can't do anything to her in this situation!

123
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,482
That moaning is Ryo!

124
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,191
Damn, I guess he couldn't resist, and snuck
into her room in the middle of the night

125
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,586
Hey, Ryo! What the hell?!

126
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,796
Harem, harem...

127
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,373
I know that.

128
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,309
If you do anything to Salina,
I won't give you a harem.

129
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,178
Oh, no, I can't move.

130
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,575
Even when both of them are
sleeping, they do this.

131
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,758
Wow, incredible! So many skyscrapers!
How beautiful!

132
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,362
Princess, what is that?

133
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,263
Tokyo Tower.

134
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,431
What is that?

135
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,898
Japan Martial Arts Pavilion.

136
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,901
That's the Diet Building.

137
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,596
Wow, I can feel the history!

138
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,506
What an artistic building!

139
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,202
This place is the lmperial Palace.
His lmperial Majesty lives here.

140
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,009
The lady-in-waiting, Salina, looks
happier than the princess.

141
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,782
It's as if Salina were the princess.

142
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,448
I wish that's the way it was.

143
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,220
How beautiful! This is the famous
Japanese cuisine, isn't it?

144
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,592
Excuse me, Your Highness, what is that?

145
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,551
That's an artistic version of red snapper
sashimi. The Japanese eat it raw.

146
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,197
Raw?
Anyway, Salina is glued to the princess,
so I can't do anything.

147
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,257
Put wasabi into soy sauce, dip it in and eat.
Anyway, Salina is glued to the princess,
so I can't do anything.

148
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,735
Off to the toilet.

149
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,771
I'm sure I have it.

150
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:20,317
Oh, oh, here it is, instant
acting sleeping pills.

151
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,985
I'm going to make the princess sleep
and take Salina out.

152
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,192
What is that?

153
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,889
Salina, why are you here?

154
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,764
Because I thought there was a
bathroom for women here too.

155
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,567
What? Oh, absolutely there is.

156
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,999
Oh, what luck!

157
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,675
Excuse me, Salina, but why don't we go
somewhere just by ourselves

158
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,802
while Kaori is taking care of the princess?

159
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,501
What did you say?

160
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,049
Oh, no, I'm just kidding, just a joke!

161
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,846
But honestly speaking, I was serious, a little.

162
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,778
Oh, the women's bathroom is over there.

163
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,946
Oh, I'm disappointed, Mr. Saeba.
Was it really a joke?

164
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,065
What? Both of them are missing?

165
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,568
Yes, I guess Ryo has taken her out.
Don't worry.

166
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,197
I guarantee that I can protect you,
Your Highness.

167
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,833
There's just one thing that bothers me.

168
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,939
He's so crazy he might get close to
Salina and try to do mokkori.

169
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,517
No way!

170
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,951
Things like that can't happen to the princess.

171
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,915
Princess, you said? What?

172
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,324
What do you mean? You're the
princess, aren't you?

173
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:42,063
Well, I'm a lady-in-waiting, Salina,
and she is the real Princess Alma.

174
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,796
Why did you tell us a lie like that?

175
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:53,302
To protect the princess from Saeba.
I've heard that he loves women,

176
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,976
so I thought she would be in danger if
he found out she's so beautiful.

177
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:03,477
Oh, exactly. It was a clever idea, but...

178
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,924
But?

179
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,093
Now, the situation has become
the worst possible!

180
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,471
Here we are.

181
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,305
This is the palace for entertainment,
hotel block in Shinjuku.

182
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,678
Wow, so many beautiful hotels!

183
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,614
Sure they are. It's fun inside too.

184
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,015
Can we get in there?

185
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,517
Of course!

186
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,643
Harem?

187
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,957
Hotel Harem? What a nice name!

188
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,584
Yes, it is. Shall we go in?

189
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,027
What a surprise!

190
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,991
Wow, this building is just like
one in a cute fairy tale.

191
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,633
I would like to go in.

192
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,100
Sure, let's go.

193
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,962
Well, I'll guide you.

194
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,603
What the hell? What is this noble aura?

195
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,849
My hand... my hand is not moving.
It won't even flinch.

196
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,476
This feeling for the first time...

197
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,458
What's the matter, Mr. Saeba?
We are going inside, aren't we?

198
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,962
Well, I'm not feeling well today,

199
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,657
so why don't we go another time?

200
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,261
I see. What a disappointment.

201
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,980
Indeed, she is a lady-in-waiting
for the princess.

202
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,678
She might be totally different from
other ordinary girls, I guess.

203
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,122
But I can't believe that I couldn't
even touch her because

204
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,957
I lost against the power of her aura.

205
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,754
Shame on myself, mokkori Ryo!

206
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,324
I promise myself that I will get her
while we are dating.

207
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,106
Mr. Saeba!

208
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,873
You guys!

209
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,516
Finally, we found you. You're coming with us.

210
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:18,154
Don't waste our time.
Well, you're going back with us.

211
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,927
Who the hell are you?

212
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,124
Did you know that cars are prohibited
inside of the park?

213
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,666
Bastard! I won't forgive you!

214
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,156
I see. You want to fight?

215
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,060
I don't guarantee you won't get hurt.

216
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,339
Bastard!

217
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,008
Stop. We're gonna have trouble if we
keep making this much noise.

218
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,475
Let's go.

219
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,978
Thank you, Mr. Saeba. Are you all right?

220
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,013
I'm pretty nimble.

221
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,623
The moment before the car hit me,
I jumped up to the tree branch.

222
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,692
Salina...

223
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,750
Yes?

224
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,861
International amity Heaven's justice hammer!


225
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,027
That was very close.

226
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,512
What the hell?

227
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,910
Why am I tied up like this?

228
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,248
The court is now in session.

229
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,355
You are guilty on two counts.

230
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,326
One, you took my lady-in-waiting
out secretly,

231
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,353
and two, you broke your promise
to me and touched Salina.

232
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,769
Therefore, you, Ryo Saeba, you have
been sentenced to death.

233
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,305
The death penalty? Wait a second.

234
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,034
You must be kidding, because what
I did was such a tiny thing.

235
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,973
No more questions accepted. Ready?

236
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,970
However, because you rescued Salina,
this time, you are forgiven.

237
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,752
Have you learned something now?

238
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,689
What kind of kid does things like this!

239
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,259
Salina, you did too much. What did he do?

240
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,987
What are you talking about?
This is a good lesson for him.

241
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,259
What are you whispering about?

242
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,926
Anyway, Highness, who do you think
they were who attacked Salina?

243
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,203
They looked like they're from your country.

244
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,103
Well, I guess they came to take us back.

245
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,137
I see. Well, I feel like you're
hiding something.

246
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,556
I don't understand!

247
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,587
Why do we need to hide the fact that
I am the princess from Mr. Saeba?

248
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:40,632
We should tell him the truth, as we did
Ms. Kaori, and ask him to protect us.

249
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,802
As we told you, he is a sexually
obsessed mokkori guy

250
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,497
so if he finds out the truth, he would...

251
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,174
Mr. Saeba was a gentleman while
he and I were by ourselves,

252
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,668
and also he protected me by risking
his life. He is a good guard.

253
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,147
But Your Highness!

254
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,637
No, I don't want to hear any more excuses.

255
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,952
Once she says something, she won't
listen to others as usual.

256
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:05,584
Salina, in this situation, I think it's a good
idea to show her how mokkori Ryo really is.

257
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,425
But how?

258
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,997
Damn, I shouldn't have promised
for an uncertain harem.

259
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,998
Today, I'm going to drink!

260
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,944
Oh, Ryo, you can't come to
the living room for a while.

261
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,506
If you drink, go to the roof top.

262
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,821
Of course, I don't need to watch you
doing aerobics, I could go anywhere.

263
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,215
Not me, Salina is going to do aerobics.

264
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,849
Sorry to keep you waiting, Salina.

265
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,163
Salina is doing aerobics?
She wears a mokkori leotard!

266
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,444
Ms. Kaori, should I take off my
underwear to wear this?

267
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,140
The outline of your body would be
more beautiful if you do.

268
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,283
Wow, Salina, you have a beautiful body!

269
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,148
Your breasts would be C-cup size, right?

270
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,850
Oh, no, Ms. Kaori.

271
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,790
I'm going to look at her.

272
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,054
Mokkori now is better than mokkori later.

273
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,864
Even though we are all women,
I'm embarrassed,

274
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,066
so please look the other way, Ms. Kaori.

275
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,434
Oh, I am so sorry.

276
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:22,634
Your body is so beautiful and I was
impressed and stared at you.

277
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,236
Your body is so beautiful and I was
impressed and stared at you.
In this situation, I don't care
about the harem.

278
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:24,770
Your body is so beautiful and I was
impressed and stared at you.
I don't care about the death penalty.
I have to see!

279
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,998
I don't care about the death penalty.
I have to see!

280
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,277
What the hell is this aura barrier?

281
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,847
Damn! I'm going to penetrate this
barrier with my mokkori power!

282
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:55,027
What the hell? What is resisting
my mokkori power?

283
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,736
What's wrong with him?
I hear him making noise.

284
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,105
My mokkori power is not working.

285
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,915
I can't believe that he did not show his
interest after we provoked him so much.

286
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,544
I told you! Mr. Saeba is not the
kind of man you think he is.

287
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,725
Mr. Saeba is a great guard. We won't
find a man like him in my country.

288
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,319
We will tell him the truth and let him
take responsibility for guarding us.

289
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,296
It boomeranged on her, I guess.

290
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,970
What the hell is that aura produced by
Salina, which blocks my mokkori power?

291
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,435
What's the matter, Ryo? Is there
something wrong? Are you sick?

292
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,514
Kaori, why? Why?!

293
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,879
What the hell?!

294
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,442
Salina has some kind of mysterious aura,

295
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,516
and it blocks my mokkori power!

296
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,458
I'm sure that an ordinary woman would
never have an aura like hers.

297
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,551
She is not an ordinary woman, I'm sure!

298
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:01,294
After deep consideration, I have reached
an incredible conclusion.

299
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,797
Ryo! No way! Did you realize
what she really is?

300
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,333
The conclusion is...

301
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,434
Salina is a cross-dresser or gay.

302
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,916
Excuse me, but...

303
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,320
That aura, it is my wild instinct
and it was teaching me

304
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,290
that this woman is gay and
doesn't get mokkori!

305
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,780
Indeed, you are right, Saeba.

306
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,788
As I thought, we failed to
hide the truth from you.

307
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:35,255
In my country, a lady-in-waiting must be
a man who dresses up like a woman.

308
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,034
What?!

309
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,038
Therefore, he can deceive enemies,

310
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,030
and he can use his strength
to guard the princess.

311
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,239
I was right.

312
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,017
Are you okay, Mr. Saeba?

313
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,621
What do you want?

314
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,660
I have something very important to tell you.

315
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,131
No way! She may tell me she loves me.

316
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,462
Excuse me!

317
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,507
Mr. Saeba, where are you?

318
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,004
Mr. Saeba, I have to talk to you.

319
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:28,185
Where did he go? I feel like he's avoiding me.

320
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,379
How was that? It worked.

321
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,260
Now, Saeba will avoid her automatically
so the princess will be safe.

322
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,663
But I think it was too much to make him
think the princess is gay.

323
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:43,835
Your Highness!

324
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,238
That's what all this is about, Salina?

325
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,178
Please forgive me, Your Highness,
but I did it for your security.

326
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,169
I don't care about such a thing.

327
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:03,148
I was looked at by Mr. Saeba
with thoughts like that.

328
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,790
He avoided me because of it.

329
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,784
Your Highness, I can't believe it, are
you falling in love with Saeba?

330
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,999
Princess!

331
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,730
Oh, my God! The princess ran away
because she was so shocked!

332
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,726
What shall I do?!

333
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:32,180
Darling, yobi dase do, itsumo audition no hi

334
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,655
Marude juni dake kisou Faye Dunaway

335

Yuushoku mo tabezu ni, diet food

336

Darling, nozomu mono, itsumo oojitai kedo

Baby, mada kimi wa hontou no

00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:11,453
Baby, ore hodo no otoko wa

341
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,358
Don't you, don't you know

by intimate contact.

00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,463
You're going to interrupt me again?!

352
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,296
You don't have time to do stuff like that.

353
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,201
Hurry up and do something about it!
