1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:15,982
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:25,414
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

3
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:33,728
Lady in the middle of the night,
blended in with the crowd

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:41,332
She is repeating whimsical dance steps

5
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:46,312
Her face shows her bluff,
pretending she is tough

6
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,644
Stays up all night while she is dancing

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,620
But the color of her eyes
shows her loneliness

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,919
She can't hide it even though she tries

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:04,964
Oh, Sarah, don't give up the
dream you believe in

10
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:12,005
Oh, Sarah, don't forget what
you're thinking about

11
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, Sarah, don't get lost, do as you feel

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh, Sarah, it's just starting now,
the new story, just for you

13
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,481
What the hell?!

14
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,784
Do you like it?

15
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,227
It's a Christmas present for you.

16
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,388
I have other things like this.

17
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,329
How about that? It's fun, isn't it?

18
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,368
How was I? Did I look like a Santa?

19
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,139
Kaori, we have a week until Christmas.

20
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,573
What the hell are you thinking?

21
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,976
This is a rehearsal.

22
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,672
See, we'll have a party at Kusunoki House.

23
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,115
I want the kids there to have fun.

24
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,650
You'll come with me, Ryo, won't you?

25
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,651
Hell no.

26
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,520
I already have plans on Christmas.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,121
What plans?

28
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,884
They have nothing to do with you, Kaori.

29
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,551
I know it's going to be nonsense.

30
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:46,665
You might not understand, but
it's very important to me.

31
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,503
Well, instead of talking about that,
you look very good in that costume.

32
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,471
Oh, really?

33
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,438
Yeah!

34
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,642
Ordinary girls don't look as good in
an outfit like that as you do.

35
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,711
You're the most suitable to deal with kids.

36
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,180
What do you mean?

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,081
Your mental age is young and it's easy
for you to connect with kids.

38
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,552
What the hell?!

39
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,586
Jerk!

40
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,787
Wait, Ryo!

41
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,088
Are you going to run away from me?

42
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,022
Stick to it!

43
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,226
Damn!

44
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:18,186
To Kaori From Ryo,
With Love at Christmas
(Part 1)

45
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,872
Kusunoki
House

46
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,123
Hi! Hey, everybody, how have you been?

47
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,627
What? What's going on?

48
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,728
Be quiet.

49
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,496
We're in big trouble now.

50
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,054
Trouble? What?

51
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,101
Who the hell are you?

52
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,767
Oh, I was just walking by.

53
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,776
See you, Mr. Hitoyoshi.

54
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,071
It's cold in here.

55
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,246
Mr. Hitoyoshi, how are you?

56
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,421
I came to see you to discuss the
plans for the Christmas party.

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,082
Ah, Ms. Kaori.

58
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,492
Is there something wrong?

59
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,686
You look pale.

60
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,994
It's nothing.

61
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,391
Ms. Kaori, Ms. Kaori!

62
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,502
This house might be closed?

63
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,274
The person you saw was a lawyer.

64
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,844
He said that the owner of
this land wants it back.

65
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,379
The owner of this land?

66
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,142
Oo... What was it?

67
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,216
Oochinko!

68
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,385
Idiot, Ookouchi.

69
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,786
Kon-ko-chiki?!

70
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
I remember!

71
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,056
Lwao Ookouchi!

72
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,059
Mr. Hitoyoshi said, "Lwao Ookouchi"!

73
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,794
Lwao Ookouchi?

74
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,728
He's someone very famous.

75
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,121
Anyway, can you tell me the whole story
again with all the details?

76
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,097
Anyway, that lawyer came and...

77
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm sure I gave you notice six months ago.

78
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,108
No way.

79
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,978
When I established this place,
we had a promise.

80
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,982
Mr. Ookouchi is telling me that he
didn't promise you anything.

81
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,016
No way!

82
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,417
Mr. Ookouchi is planning to use
this land in an efficient way.

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,323
He thinks it's a waste of the land to
let an orphanage stand here.

84
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,623
Waste?!

85
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,730
How is this orphanage a waste,
adopting unlucky kids?

86
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,866
That is what Mr. Ookouchi said, not me.

87
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,569
Anyway, you have to remove yourself
from the premises this week.

88
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,404
Ridiculous!

89
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,873
I'm sure you owe Mr. Ookouchi something.

90
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,501
Isn't it useless for you to say anything?

91
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,978
I owe something?

92
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,707
Lwao Ookouchi, you bastard!

93
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,717
I see.

94
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,755
Listening to your story, I think Mr. Hitoyoshi
was cheated by Ookouchi.

95
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,091
Ms. Kaori, what will happen to us?

96
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,026
Don't worry. I'll do something about it.

97
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,691
Really?

98
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,336
I see.

99
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,372
The kids heard that.

100
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,239
In a situation like this, why don't you
report it to the police?

101
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,176
The police?

102
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,179
Mr. Hitoyoshi, you were cheated by
this guy Ookouchi,

103
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,582
and this land is about to be taken
away from you, isn't it?

104
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,750
Then why not?

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,186
Ms. Kaori, I will protect this House
no matter what happens.

106
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,889
So, please don't worry about us.

107
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,324
But...

108
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,594
No, this is my problem, not yours.

109
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,891
So please.

110
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,802
Library

111
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,673
Lwao Ookouchi

112
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,470
Top 50 Influential People in Japan
After WW2

113
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,583
Influential in Japan...

114
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,448
Anyway, how does Mr. Hitoyoshi know him?

115
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,220
Have a nice Eve with Ryo!

116
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,278
Have a nice Eve with Ryo!
No!

117
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,723
Why not?

118
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,590
You can see I'm going to be busy.

119
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,251
Invitation to a Christmas party.

120
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,863
What the hell is this?

121
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,964
Who's going to have a party?

122
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,699
I am, of course.

123
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,500
Where?

124
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,435
Here.

125
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,895
I'm going to invite lots of girls and we'll
have a cheerful mokkori party!

126
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,542
Air-head!

127
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,144
Are you saying that you can't work
because of a silly thing like that?

128
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,915
You say work, but who is the client?

129
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,917
I said it's going to be me!

130
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,921
Why do I have to do a favor for you?

131
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,923
There's no pay for this.

132
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,426
Like I said, in order to protect the House.

133
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:44,897
Why do I have to protect the House
when I'm so busy?

134
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,766
The kids are in trouble!

135
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,734
Don't you think it would be
nice to help them?

136
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,760
I am not interested in a year-end
charity campaign.

137
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,974
Ryo, since when have you became
such a heartless person?

138
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,243
Even when I ask you?

139
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,845
Are you asking me?

140
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,837
Then, isn't there a better way of
asking for a favor?

141
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:09,322
You could try to convince me in a more lovely
way, with a more feminine attitude.

142
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,923
After you beat me as much as you can,

143
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,891
there is no way you can ask me
for a favor, is there?

144
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,497
Once in a while, why don't you
approach me in a sexy way?

145
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,261
Then, I might say yes.

146
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,996
It's not possible for you, as I thought.

147
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,208
Well, I guess baby-sitting is your job, isn't it?

148
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:34,077
I have to be with a lot of girls
for my Christmas!

149
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,186
You're the worst kind of jerk!

150
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,744
I won't ask you for anything anymore, Ryo!

151
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,961
Good grief...

152
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,635
Lwao Ookouchi

153
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:58,127
Why the hell is there a pillar in
the middle of the hallway?!

154
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:19,451
Patience

155
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,263
Too much?

156
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,799
I guess this is good.

157
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,715
I think I made a mistake in measuring
the amount of plastic explosive.

158
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,185
What the hell was that noise?

159
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,158
Damn!

160
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,662
Who are you?!

161
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,780
What's going on?

162
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,184
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,786
A thief broke into the safe.

164
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,775
What? The safe?

165
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,983
Oh, no!

166
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,256
Sorry.

167
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,934
Damn! You, pervert!

168
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,443
Wait! Thief!

169
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,501
Trouble!

170
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:14,400
How many nights before Christmas?

171
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,672
Come over to my house at Christmas and
have fun together doing mokkori!

172
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,266
Hey, why don't we have
mokkori at Christmas?

173
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,144
Mokkori! Mokkori!

174
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,278
Oh, no, he's a pervert.

175
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,747
Hurry, let's leave.

176
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,181
Oh, no, I might have been too frivolous.

177
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,453
Oh, Saeko, what good timing!

178
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,956
I want to give this to you.

179
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,324
What is this?

180
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,960
You see, a Christmas Party.

181
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,929
You, you can't get carried away just
because of things like this.

182
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,498
Am I getting carried away?

183
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,898
No way. I'm usually cool.

184
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,470
I saw Kaori last night.

185
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,598
Do you think it's all right to let her do
a dangerous mission like that alone?

186
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,940
Wow, finally, Kaori did it, didn't she?

187
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,879
What are you thinking?

188
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,249
Well, it's about time for her to be independent
and strike out on her own.

189
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,151
I see, so you say.

190
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,554
I'm not against you, but I don't know
what will happen to her.

191
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,591
Anyway, this is my advice.

192
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,660
Kaori is in pretty big trouble.

193
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,165
She'll be fine, because she has trained
under me for this job for a long time.

194
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,299
I wonder if that's true or not?

195
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,869
Well, if something happens to her, you'll be
the one who takes all the responsibility.

196
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,638
What? Are you leaving?

197
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,969
Hey, you are coming to my party, aren't you?

198
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,409
Sorry, I already have an appointment.

199
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,876
Bye.

200
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,947
Kaori... I wonder what she's done?

201
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,473
Here! This is it!

202
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,641
Really?

203
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,676
Just as I thought.

204
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,511
According to this document,

205
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,513
the land the House is on originally
belonged to Mr. Hitoyoshi.

206
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,716
It means, his land was stolen, doesn't it?

207
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,717
Probably.

208
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,184
Ms. Kaori!

209
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,917
Trouble! Trouble!

210
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,761
I was told to start working by
the owner of this land.

211
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,664
Even though you complain all day,
I can't stop doing this.

212
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,293
But we're still living here.

213
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,003
I don't know about that.

214
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,671
I was told by the owner, and...

215
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,340
Wait a second.

216
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,535
I have the certificate of ownership
for this land.

217
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,478
The owner is this man, Mr. Hitoyoshi.

218
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,446
Look!

219
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,513
This is the original.

220
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,946
No way...

221
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,586
I don't know who asked you to do this,
but we don't need you.

222
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,321
Hurry up and go home now.

223
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,589
Yes! Go home!

224
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,757
Go home, go home!

225
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,851
Go home! Go home! Go home...

226
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,636
Damn! What's going on?

227
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,070
Oh well, we're going home for today.

228
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,730
We did it!

229
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,704
We did it!

230
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,040
Ms. Kaori, what's going on?

231
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,089
Kaori broke into the safe at
Lwao Ookouchi's house?

232
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,693
Yes, and we're pretty upset.

233
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,718
Then, what do you want me to do?

234
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,227
I want you to return the document
that you had her steal.

235
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,637
You may say so, but she did it on her own.

236
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,772
What did you say?

237
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,296
We're asking you nicely!

238
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,071
Is that a proper attitude for asking
someone for a favor?

239
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,747
Well, I'm going to go home.

240
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,115
I am sorry.

241
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,018
That man has no manners.

242
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,019
Hey!

243
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,486
Yes!

244
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,762
I won't say tasteless things like
return the document for free.

245
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,565
I don't know who asked you
to get the document,

246
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,023
but now we want to buy the
whole thing from you.

247
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,437
I see.

248
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,874
However, I have nothing to do
with this matter.

249
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,109
I see.

250
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,771
I guess you are telling me that
this is not enough.

251
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,648
Please tell me the conditions.

252
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,708
If the amount is acceptable to us,
we will prepare the payment.

253
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,586
No matter how much?

254
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,588
Well, I don't know what Kaori stole from you,

255
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,955
but I guess she stole some incredibly
valuable things, didn't she?

256
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,127
No way...

257
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,118
You really don't know about it?

258
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,765
Nope.

259
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,064
I guess we misunderstood.

260
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,270
I would like you to forget about everything.

261
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,737
I have some urgent things to do.

262
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,049
What's going on?

263
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,123
Why?

264
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,459
This certificate originally belongs
to you, doesn't it?

265
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,586
I can't accept a stolen document.

266
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,959
No matter what the reason was, this is the
document I handed to Lwao Ookouchi.

267
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,701
This document was taken away from you
because he cheated you, wasn't it?

268
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,699
As long as we have this document, you won't
be kicked out of this place.

269
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:28,147
I always tell my kids not to
do anything immoral.

270
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,516
They're the ones who were immoral.

271
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,644
I don't think you would destroy your
morals if you accept this.

272
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,223
Anyway, I am going to take this
document to Lwao Ookouchi.

273
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,697
And I'm going to talk with him and make it
legal for this place to stay here.

274
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,399
Wait a second.

275
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:52,359
Mr. Hitoyoshi, are they taking advantage
of your weak position or something?

276
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,441
Please tell me.

277
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,102
There's has to be some reason,
doesn't there?

278
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,156
Ms. Kaori, I...

279
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,273
Ms. Kaori!

280
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,741
I'll keep this.

281
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,144
If you have this, Mr. Hitoyoshi,
they'll take it away from you.

282
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,270
See you.

283
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,250
That woman!

284
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,823
Both of you, chase her.

285
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:45,124
Yes, Sir.
Both of you, chase her.

286
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
Yes, Sir.
The rest of you guys, search the
house from top to bottom!

287
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,859
The rest of you guys, search the
house from top to bottom!

288
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,985
Yes, Sir.

289
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:54,933
What are you going to do?

290
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,400
Shut up!

291
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,411
What are you doing?! Stop!

292
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,848
Stop!

293
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,116
Jerk!

294
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,152
What the hell?!

295
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,053
Hey, let me go! Hey!

296
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,488
I'll never let you go!

297
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,957
Damn, damn, damn!

298
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,424
Kenta!

299
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,099
Damn!

300
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,133
Stop, Kenta!

301
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,569
Let me go, Yuri! Let me go!

302
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,770
Why the hell are you letting them
do things like that?!

303
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,238
Make them stop!

304
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,341
You know what we want.

305
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,606
If you give it up now, I'll stop
them immediately.

306
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,914
I'll return the certificate of
ownership for this land,

307
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,249
so please stop the violence against my kids.

308
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,984
Certificate of ownership for this land?

309
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,384
I'm not looking for silly stuff like that.

310
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,117
Where did you hide it?

311
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,654
Not the certificate? Then what...

312
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,228
Wait!

313
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,230
No way!

314
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,915
Are you ready?

315
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,836
Well, before your neck gets broken,
hurry up and give it to me!

316
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,271
No!

317
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,973
Hurry up and give it to him.

318
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,574
No, I won't!

319
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,836
Shut up!

320
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,785
You?!

321
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,088
Hi, I met you before, bad-mannered guy.

322
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,922
Ryo...

323
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,184
Bastard!

324
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,660
When you kick someone, do just like I did.

325
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,462
No matter what happens, I won't
give this to them.

326
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:14,339
I have the important document, the
certificate of ownership for the land.

327
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,307
Well, the situation has been
changed already.

328
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,879
More critical things have happened.

329
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,040
More important than the document
that you are keeping.

330
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,452
This has swollen!

331
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,046
You've been growing like a normal
woman, haven't you?

332
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,461
What the hell did you do at a time like this?!

333
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,530
No! Stop!

334
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,731
Be quiet!

335
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,832
Stop!

336
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,334
What are you doing to a little kid like her!?

337
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,894
We won't hurt her so don't worry.

338
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,771
See you.

339
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,245
Wait, you jerk!

340
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,049
I'm just kidding.

341
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,818
I know that your breasts don't grow,
of course not.

342
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,013
What?!

343
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,189
Yuri!

344
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,192
Ms. Kaori!

345
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,327
What's the matter?

346
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,524
Keiko, Keiko was kidnapped.

347
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,597
What the hell?!

348
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:33,348
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

349
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,823
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

350
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,554
You skip dinner and eat diet food

351
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:48,693
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

352
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,105
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

353
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,438
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

354
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:03,542
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

355
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:12,621
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

356
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,526
Don't you, don't you know

357
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:20,899
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

358
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:28,738
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

359
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,637
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

360
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,285
Keiko has been kidnapped!

361
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,052
What shall we do?

362
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,423
There's no other way except to
take her back by force.

363
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,559
She isn't their target. But we can't
even try to make a deal.

364
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,628
They were so mean to us,
and still they cheat us.

365
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,829
You're really mad, aren't you?

366
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,164
Yes, about to explode.

367
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,499
Well, then can I expect to see your
Final Bazooka Attack?

368
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:58,570
Sure, I'll never, ever forgive Ookouchi!

369
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,738
City Hunter 2:

370
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,841
"To Kaori From Ryo
With Love at Christmas (Part 2)"

371
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,409
If you miss it, you won't
be able to see Santa.

372
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,368
Please look forward to the next episode
