Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,
atarashii story, just for you

13
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,298
Ayako Serizawa's hobby is painting.

14
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,900
She is the widow of the fourth leader
of the Kanto Kichijo Gumi.

15
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,903
She's nineteen years old and probably
a virgin, a mokkori widow.

16
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:47,207
Behave yourself! The members of
the group love her to death.

17
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,741
If something happens to her,
fingers are going to get cut off!

18
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,709
Scary!

19
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,313
Hey, Ms. Ayako has been targeted by
the ltsukaichi Kai, hasn't she?

20
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:57,545
They want ownership of the park that
belongs to the Kichijo Gumi.

21
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:02,021
For Ayako, that park is linked to
memories of her late husband.

22
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,387
We must help her!

23
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:09,584
Nineteen Year-Old Widow!
Lover in the Heart of a Beautiful Sketch Artist
(Part 2)

24
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,801
How's it going? Nothing?

25
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,903
Yes, just like this.

26
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,395
Well, since all of us are watching him,
he can't move at all.

27
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,308
What is it?

28
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,402
Well, I think he's sleeping too quietly.

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,784
Ryo!

30
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,445
What's this?!

31
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,221
Ryo!

32
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,389
He escaped!


33
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,856
I found him!

34
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,193
This way! What? Don't let him go!

35
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,861
Wait! That way!

36
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,696
He ran that way!

37
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,198
He's like a cockroach!

38
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,666
Don't let him go!

39
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,860
Catch him!

40
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,230
Found him! Madame is in danger!

41
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,075
Madame's Room
If you enter without permission,
you will be killed!
Masaichi

42
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,011
Ginnoji, don't let him go!

43
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,312
I caught him.

44
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,770
Damn! I was so close!

45
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,686
Really! We can't take our eyes
off you for a second!

46
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:11,453
Ryo, Madame is still in deep sadness
after her husband's death.

47
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,293
That's why!

48
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,665
That's why I'm trying to sneak into her
room in the middle of the night.

49
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,099
Why can't you understand?!

50
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,566
What?

51
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,405
Ayako is still young. She's only
nineteen years old.

52
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,703
She has a long way to go in life!

53
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,978
Don't you want her to rejoin life
as an ordinary young woman,

54
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,175
who falls in love and shines with youth?

55
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,218
Well, sure I do.

56
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,920
Mr. Masa, don't listen to Ryo.

57
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,823
He's very good at making bullshit
excuses to justify himself.

58
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,994
I am trying to teach her the joy of love again.

59
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,861
I know that her late husband
in Heaven also wants it.

60
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,500
He's right.

61
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,027
Therefore, I am going to sneak into her
room tonight. Don't disturb me.

62
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,038
Wait, you smart mouth!

63
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,071
Madame?

64
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,654
Mr. Saeba,

65
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,622
I am going to the park tomorrow.

66
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,317
Would you please come with me, just you?

67
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,286
I'm going to fill the empty space in my heart.

68
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,266
Goodnight.

69
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,147
See, Ayako understood what I was thinking.

70
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,614
Indeed!

71
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,084
Just the two of us at the park!

72
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,450
I wonder what we'll do there?

73
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,081
Listen! Don't follow us.

74
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,016
Her way to fill the emptiness in her heart

75
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,218
is to paint a picture of this place.

76
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,346
Well, actually, I thought it was
too good to be true.

77
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,171
We were worrying too much.

78
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,071
It looks like she's going to paint a picture.

79
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,575
That's good.

80
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,945
I believed in Madame, so...

81
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,776
Then, what are they going to do?

82
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,259
Ms. Ayako, is something wrong?

83
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,727
I feel a powerful struggle within her.

84
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,531
Here we go! Wow, wait!


85
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,136
Wow, it's so cold, isn't it?

86
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,090
What's wrong with Ms. Ayako?

87
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,054
She's been staring at the canvas
for a long time.

88
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,593
Well, you've done enough today,
haven't you?

89
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,036
I understood it.

90
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,777
I shouldn't be like this.

91
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,877
My husband told me the exact
same thing, Mr. Saeba.

92
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,557
After I die, don't be tied down by it.

93
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,024
Live freely, he said.

94
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,827
But I can't.

95
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,597
I can't even paint a picture of this park.

96
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,064
I knew it.

97
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,766
This place has too many memories
of my husband.

98
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,980
After he died,

99
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,151
every time I tried to paint, I couldn't,
because of my tears.

100
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,088
So I thought that if I could fill this
canvas with green trees,

101
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,285
then I might be able to start a new path,

102
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,489
but I still can't.

103
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,859
I can't fill the empty space in my heart!

104
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,975
Madame!

105
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,970
What's that smoke?

106
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,584
Fire! The trees are burning!

107
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,142
The park is on fire!

108
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,256
What?!

109
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,257
Why?!

110
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,246
Damn!

111
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,315
How did the fire spread so fast?!

112
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,914
Help!

113
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,685
Ayako, get a hold of yourself!

114
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,299
Arson? Masa!

115
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,634
Yes, Sir!


116
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,902
Don't just stand around!

117
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,738
Make everyone put the fire out,
even the ones hiding in the park!

118
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,106
Well...

119
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,374
Hurry up!

120
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,176
Yes, Sir! Ginnoji, Saburo!

121
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,845
Everybody hurry up and put the fire out!

122
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,142
Yes, Sir.

123
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,981
Wait, Mr. Masa.

124
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,483
Put out the fire later.

125
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,044
Guide the people escaping from the fire!
That's the priority!

126
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,486
Hurry up! The Kichijo Gumi
manages this park!

127
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,189
We have a responsibility to save the people.

128
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,029
But, Madame...

129
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,398
We can't let anyone get hurt. Hurry up!

130
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,401
Masa, didn't you hear what she said?


131
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,902
Yes, Sir.

132
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,171
Everybody, hurry up! Let's go!

133
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:32,967
Yes, Sir!

134
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,440
Hey, hurry up. This way, hurry up!

135
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,989
You didn't leave any evidence, did you?

136
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,286
No, Sir.

137
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,962
After the park burns, there will be
nothing of value to protect.

138
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,333
She's just a woman.

139
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,868
After she loses the place
her heart is tied to,

140
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,428
she'll change her mind and
let me have the land.

141
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,912
Thank you, everyone.

142
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,893
Because of your efforts, no one was hurt.

143
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,293
Only a third of the park was burnt.

144
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,764
Thank you very much, really.

145
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,159
I suspect you tired yourself out today,
so please rest tonight.

146
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,967
Wait a second, Madame!

147
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:46,201
I'm sure that members of the
ltsukaichi Kai started the fire.

148
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,816
I won't forgive the ones who ruined the
park that's so important to you.

149
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,451
Why don't we rush in and fight them?!

150
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,086
Cut it out.

151
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,255
There is no evidence that they did it.

152
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,456
But...

153
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,858
But we know it.

154
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,695
If you do that, it's what they'll be waiting for.

155
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,164
But when I think about how
Madame feels right now...

156
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,530
No, Mr. Saeba is right.

157
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,002
Don't worry about me.

158
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,560
I'm fine.

159
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,536
Madame!

160
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,962
Madame doesn't want us to worry about her.

161
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,611
Masaichi, we should do something
about Ootone!

162
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,578
No!

163
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,916
Do you want to make Madame
even more upset?

164
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,117
But...

165
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,351
Listen!

166
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,081
If you're that kind of person, I'm going
to kick you out. Understand?

167
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,523
Bro...

168
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,424
Masa!

169
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,952
Mr. Masa, please wait. This was obviously
done by the ltsukaichi Kai!

170
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,759
No evidence?

171
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,370
I don't need any.

172
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,718
I'm sorry, Madame.

173
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,586
I'm going to take my leave as of today.

174
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,892
Oh! You bastards!

175
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,662
Mr. Masa, where are you going in the
middle of the night like this?

176
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,731
Well, I have to take a leak.

177
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,267
Coming outside to pee?

178
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,436
Shut up! What are you doing then?

179
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,667
Yes, Sir. We all need to pee.

180
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,637
You guys.

181
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,340
All right, I got you. Let's all go pee together!

182
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,318
Hello, ltsukaichi Company.

183
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,490
Boss, it's for you.

184
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,426
It's me.

185
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,553
Who are you? What do you want?

186
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,397
You jerk!

187
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,100
It looks like you pulled off a shrewd plan,

188
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,302
but you made one mistake,

189
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,363
showing me the tears of a sad woman.

190
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:33,212
You have to pay the price now.
If you can, look out the window.

191
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,181
Out the window?

192
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,648
What's the matter, boss?

193
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,376
Eat this angry iron ball!

194
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,623
A dream?

195
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,451
I guess I fell asleep.

196
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,330
It's so quiet around here.

197
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,533
Mr. Masa?

198
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,602
Mr. Ginnoji? Mr. Saeba?

199
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,069
What's the matter?

200
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,600
Mr. Saburo? Everybody?

201
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,999
Oh, no!

202
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,177
No, everybody! Please don't do anything!

203
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,708
No!

204
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,709
I...

205
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,176
Mr. Masaichi!

206
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,983
Madame! Why are you here?

207
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,586
Idiot, idiot, idiot. I told you that you
couldn't rush into their place!

208
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,088
Madame, please calm down.

209
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,181
We won't be able to do anything
with the place already like this.

210
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,437
When we got here, it looked
like that and boom!

211
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,538
Boom?

212
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,341
Somebody, please let me down!

213
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,777
That's Ootone!

214
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,540
What is he doing up there?

215
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,748
We are the arsonists.
I'm so sorry.

216
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,582
We are the arsonists.
I burned down the forest. I confess!

217
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,086
Who did all this?

218
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,558
Mr. Saeba?

219
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,550
Ryo, Mr. Saeba did?

220
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,456
Mr. Saeba...

221
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,832
Kanto
Kichijo
Gumi

222
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,772
Mr. Saeba!

223
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,872
Please wake up, Mr. Saeba.

224
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,812
Mr. Saeba!

225
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:53,050
What is it? I stayed up late last night,
so please let me sleep a little longer.

226
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,685
What's going on?

227
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,461
The morning bath is ready, so
I came to let you know.

228
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,096
Morning bath?

229
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,065
Don't wake me up for something like that.

230
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,599
I see.

231
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,365
I think Madame is in the bath now,

232
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,673
so if you want to take a bath,
please do so after her.

233
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,409
Ms. Ayako is? In the early morning like this?

234
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:22,506
Yes, Madame usually takes a bath
every morning, at this time.

235
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,351
Well, I am sorry to disturb you
in the early morning.

236
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,046
Please go back to sleep for
as long as you want.

237
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,826
Ms. Ayako is in the bath.

238
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,820
I was careless. I didn't realize it
for a couple of days.

239
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,798
Brother,

240
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,102
are you serious?

241
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,638
Of course! I can't do something
like this as a joke.

242
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,107
But, brother...

243
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,565
Last night, I saw a real man in Mr. Saeba.

244
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,742
And I decided he's the only man who
can make Madame happy.

245
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,083
But, Masa,

246
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,819
I don't think Mr. Saeba, who is a womanizer,

247
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,622
will be able to stay married peacefully.

248
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,825
That's why we came up with
this plan, didn't we?

249
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,361
Look, Ryo is a lewd man,

250
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,660
so I'm sure he'll go into the bathroom
while Madame is in there.

251
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,300
Mr. Saeba, why did you come in?

252
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,536
Oh, I didn't know you were in here.

253
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,868
Well, it's not a big deal.
Let's take a bath together.

254
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,902
You're taking a bath with Madame even
though you're not her husband!

255
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,081
Now, you have to choose, either take
full responsibility and get married,

256
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,083
or cut your finger off.

257
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,886
I'll get married, so please
don't cut my finger off!

258
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,353
Wow, how happy I am!

259
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,120
That is what will happen.

260
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,087
I wonder whether this plan will be
successful or not?

261
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,696
See, he's coming out.

262
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,837
Now, let's follow him.

263
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,304
Yes, Sir.

264
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,181
Here she is!

265
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,118
Ready!

266
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,054
I didn't know someone was already in here.

267
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,121
You, not husband and wife,
taking a bath together!

268
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,909
I want you to explain what's going on.

269
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,346
Oh, no, we don't understand this either.

270
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,017
What are you doing? Stop!

271
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:43,489
Madame is waiting for you at the park
so please hurry and go there.

272
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,354
Have fun!

273
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,493
What's wrong with them today?

274
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,538
Ayako?

275
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,808
Mr. Saeba!

276
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,309
What are you doing?

277
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,040
What am I doing? I feel that I might be able
to paint the picture of the park now.

278
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,881
But the trees are burned and there's
no green to fill up your canvas.

279
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,846
Green on the canvas...

280
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,925
Did you paint this while you were
looking at the burnt field?

281
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,620
I can see

282
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,062
the green trees which used to be here,

283
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,654
memories that are gone.

284
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,796
Listen, don't make any mistakes!

285
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,172
You're going to threaten Ryo
by taking a picture

286
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,141
and force him to marry
Ms. Ayako, aren't you?

287
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,143
Ms. Kaori!

288
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,512
You're such happy idiots, aren't you?

289
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,114
What do you mean?

290
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,284
Idiot, if you're really thinking about
Ms. Ayako, stop that now.

291
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,586
But when I think about Madame...

292
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,688
Do you really want to make her miserable?

293
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,891
Sir, they're not doing the right thing.

294
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,451
I don't think they'll get closer at all.

295
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,600
I realized something while I was
looking at the burnt field here.

296
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,839
Even though the forest is burned,

297
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,137
the memory in my heart will never disappear.

298
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,639
My heart is not an empty canvas.

299
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,179
There is a picture of memories
already painted in there.

300
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,454
What I have to do is

301
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:27,187
make a new canvas in my mind and
start painting a new picture.

302
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,194
Exactly.

303
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,595
A blank, new canvas called tomorrow.

304
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,331
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

305
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,927
Thanks to you, I will finally be able
to find a new, white canvas.

306
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,640
Hey, Ginnoji,

307
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,609
did you understand what Madame just
said, something new, white?

308
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,168
Of course I don't understand.

309
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,873
She was finally able to make the death of her
husband into a memory in her heart.

310
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,922
Now, she intends to find a new love.

311
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,857
New love?

312
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:03,562
Which means, Madame hasn't
fallen in love yet?!

313
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,031
Which means, she doesn't love Mr. Saeba?!

314
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,166
Well, I guess so.

315
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:12,738
Oh, no! We don't need to tie Madame
and that womanizer together!

316
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,807
She might fall in love with me!

317
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,409
What? It could be me?!

318
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,578
I might have a chance?!

319
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,414
Can you accept this picture when I'm done?

320
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,350
But it's an important picture for you
from your memory, isn't it?

321
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,987
I'll be able to paint as much as I want to
since I have a new canvas.

322
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,891
You're right. Then I will accept it
as my pay for the work.

323
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,326
Madame!

324
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,554
Madame!

325
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,831
Madame, congratulations!

326
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,890
Finally, you were able to paint this picture!

327
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,670
Oh, why are all of you here?

328
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,638
We were worried about you, Madame.

329
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,070
Excuse me, but what the hell
are you thinking?

330
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:03,218
Mr. Masa and the others really love
Ms. Ayako, don't they?

331
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,782
Oh, boy, spring is here.

332
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,994
People are excited. The season of
falling in love is here.

333
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,791
All year round for you.

334
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,598
For me, it's spring all year long!

335
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,102
Guitar o kikase ta katta

336
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,799

Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

346
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,019
You're always gone at the
same time every day.

347
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,554
Do you have a mistress again?

348
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,990
No way! Kozue is sick, I'm telling you.

349
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,458
Oh, you're visiting a patient?

350
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,226
I thought you went there because of
her older sister.

351
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,795
