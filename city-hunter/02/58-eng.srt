Oh, Sarah, ima hajimaru,

13
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,239
Wait for me, my beautiful women!

14
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,638
I got you!

15
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,887
Hey, beautiful girls!

16
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:09,027
Wow, you are exactly my type! I'll dig in!

17
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,724
Ryo?

18
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,471
Oh, no! It was a dream.

19
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,306
What do you mean?

20
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:29,841
Idiot! If you have time to take a nap,
go and look for a job!

21
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,792
What?

22
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,628
Gramps, who is this man?

23
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,629
Gramps?

24
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,664
Yes, this man is...

25
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,961
Who the hell are you?

26
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,734
"Who the hell..."

27
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,693
Silence! Who do you think
this gentleman is?!

28
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,775
Who is he? The famous samurai
Lord Mito from the Edo era.

29
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,242
Not likely, right?

30
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,805
You are close, because he's
from very high society.

31
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,183
Oh, Saeko, are these guys with you?

32
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,385
With me? It's too rude to say things like that.

33
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,718
This gentleman is His Majesty, King Nalio
of the Faunde Republic.

34
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,449
What the hell? This little rat is?!

35
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:17,385
Ryo Educates in a Spartan Way
A Bad Prince Raised in a Harem
(Part 1)

36
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,204
Is that brat really the king?

37
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:30,343
He is. He's just succeeded his late father.

38
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:35,114
I see, then that kid must be
a super high-society boy.

39
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,046
Yes, he is.

40
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,317
So what?

41
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,717
I have a little favor to ask.

42
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,012
Favor?

43
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,681
It has to be you. Please?

44
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,159
Prince Nalio, please stop.
This old man might get sick.

45
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,024
What are you talking about?!

46
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,028
Prince Nalio?!

47
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,069
It's all my fault. Please forgive me.

48
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,305
I'm fine.

49
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:03,674
Where did Your Majesty get hit?
Here? Oh, I am so sorry.

50
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,837
What a lapdog servant.

51
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,311
And now, the last area to clean,
the bathroom.

52
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,905
An assassination plot?

53
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,013
Someone plans to steal the position
of king from Prince Nalio.

54
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:45,076
The Faunde Kingdom is small but rich
in mineral resources, right?

55
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,552
Yes, it is.

56
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,621
The late king was a man of peace
and its resources

57
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,580
have been exported only for the
purposes of peace. However...

58
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,919
Let me take over your story.

59
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,172
The person who is trying to kill Prince Nalio

60
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,642
is the brother of the late king, Lord Baccalo.

61
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,510
Lord Baccalo is different from the late king,
possessed by a lust for money.

62
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,615
He is aiming to be the king

63
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,751
and plotting to earn money with
the mineral resources.

64
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,187
Then that super-spoiled child is in his way?


65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,223
Right after the death of the late king,

66
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,124
assassins have threatened Prince Nalio.

67
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,385
My mission is to protect Prince Nalio,

68
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,627
and I really want to protect him from
the followers of Lord Baccalo.

69
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,893
But there's no evidence even if you
try to catch him?

70
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,605
Please help us.

71
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,572
Please...


72
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,345
Why don't you and I discuss
this business alone?

73
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,913
A man and a woman...

74
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,313
I might be able to accept your favor
without putting on any clothes.

75
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,686
What the hell?!

76
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,486
Has something happened to Prince Nalio?!
Oh, no!

77
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,882
Hey, old man!

78
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,251
Prince Nalio!

79
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,622
Help me!

80
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,307
Prince Nalio!

81
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,942
Stay back!

82
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,105
Help me, Ryo!

83
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,750
No! No!

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,480
Prince Nalio, please stop being selfish.

85
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,486
Please take a nice bath and wash your face.

86
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,082
No! I don't want to.

87
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,024
Please, listen to Gramps.

88
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,628
No! I said no!

89
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,025
Prince Nalio...

90
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,664
All right. Then Saeko, you
take a bath with me.

91
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,636
Hey, even I haven't done that before!

92
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,372
Ms. Saeko, please do me a favor.

93
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,568
Please take a bath with Prince Nalio.

94
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,347
You're not going to...

95
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,510
It can't be helped, and besides,
he's just a child.

96
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,044
I'm taking a bath.

97
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,282
Then it can't be helped. I'll bathe as well.

98
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,750
They don't need you! What are you thinking?!


99
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,866
You're cute, but not in front
of everybody, so...

100
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,268
I see.

101
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,302
Saeko, you have big breasts.

102
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,977
They're not your toys.

103
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,910
Damn it! I wanna see, wanna see,
wanna see, wanna see!

104
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,040
I'm gonna see!

105
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,824
What a noisy guy!

106
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,418
I'm thirsty. Bring me something to drink.

107
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,714
Saeko, how long do you intend
to leave Nalio here?

108
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,908
But if you consider something,
I might be able to accept...

109
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,086
Gramps!

110
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,087
Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,554
You know what I want, Saeko!

112
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,358
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Prince Nalio is saying that a man like you

113
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,460
Prince Nalio is saying that a man like you

114
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,131
cannot be close to Ms. Saeko,
not even a meter away,

115
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,268
and also, as she is engaged
to Prince Nalio,

116
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,104
she is now a person of very noble position.

117
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,767
Engaged? Saeko and that little kid?

118
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,235
Be silent!

119
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:34,647
Prince Nalio has been engaged in the study
of regal principles since he was very young.

120
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,649
You've no right to criticize him!

121
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,447
So what?! I've been learning...

122
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:41,949
Get down!

123
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,881
Don't move!

124
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,924
Old man, hurry up!

125
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,199
What's the matter?

126
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,432
Stay back, Kaori!

127
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,701
Saeko, get out of here with the kid.

128
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,870
Okay.

129
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,667
Gramps...

130
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,032
You poor thing...

131
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,326
He really is in serious danger.

132
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,212
Special Room
No Visitors

133
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,822
Even though I am old and
it's difficult to work,

134
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,958
I have done my best until now
to protect Prince Nalio.

135
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,227
However, in this situation, you are
the only one whom I can ask.

136
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,695
I am sorry, but I refuse to baby-sit a kid.

137
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,969
I feel so sad for Prince Nalio!

138
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,530
It was his fate to be born into
the family of a king.

139
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,375
He has to finish his short life
of only eight years,

140
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,640
because of his uncle, who is
of his own blood...

141
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,942
To be killed without experiencing
the fun of childhood...

142
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,550
Poor thing!

143
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,887
Oh, I feel so sorry for Prince Nalio.

144
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,050
Recalling his eight years of life,
it has been so unlucky.

145
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,827
I can't believe it, I can't...

146
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,988
Mr. Gliss, please don't despair.

147
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:37,227
Oh, if only I could exchange what time I have
left to live for the Prince's safety!

148
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,828
Then I could die peacefully!

149
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,609
It's obvious what you're up to.

150
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,612
I don't have time to deal with you.
I'm going home.

151
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,307
Oh, he knew it.

152
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,887
Perhaps all this was a little much?

153
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,847
Well, you weren't hurt at all, so...

154
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,727
Anyway, there is nobody except Mr. Saeba

155
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,195
with whom we can entrust Prince Nalio.


156
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,961
Shall we continue acting for
a little while longer?

157
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,105
Man, those characters are unbelievable.

158
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,050
Hi, ladies. What's wrong?

159
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,087
It looks like we have a punctured tire.

160
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,387
Wow! She's my type! I might be punctured.

161
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,016
Let me see. Oh, you're right!

162
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,527
I can fix it right now. Where are the tools?


163
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,393
Thank you so much. The tools
should be in the back seat.

164
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,337
What the hell?!

165
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,881
Get in!

166
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,128
Damn!

167
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,180
Well, shirt, pants and socks...

168
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,813
Good, the sizes look about right.

169
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,493
Come on, change into this and this.

170
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,695
We're going to see Mr. Gliss,
and your outfit is too showy.

171
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,725
You have bad taste, don't you?

172
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,862
Damn it, if he wasn't the king, I'd...

173
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,368
Hey, hurry up and change me.

174
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,435
Changing me is my servant's job.

175
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,979
I'm not your servant.

176
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,314
People do those things by themselves
in the normal world.

177
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,044
Kings don't need to change by themselves.

178
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,916
Oh, really.

179
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,101
Watch out!

180
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,495
Insolent!

181
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,040
Hey, cut his head off!

182
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,240
What did you say, you little brat?

183
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,104
I'm sorry. I have to discipline him better.

184
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,481
Discipline him thoroughly!

185
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,841
Yes, Sir!

186
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,884
Hey! When I give an order...

187
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,890
There are so many people,

188
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,949
so why don't we walk a little more carefully?

189
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,994
The king is walking!

190
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,021
Normally, people move to the side of the
pavement in order to get out of my way!

191
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,268
This is Japan.

192
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,634
Things are different from your
country, Prince Nalio.

193
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,932
What?

194
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,875
Where did you go? Please answer me!

195
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,355
Sorry to keep you waiting.

196
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,488
Here, thank you.

197
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,090
Welcome.

198
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,197
Give me one.

199
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,391
Right, one.

200
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,295
Here, two hundred yen.

201
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,310
Hey, pay up! Stop, thief!

202
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,676
Sorry, he's with me.

203
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,772
Here, two hundred yen, right? I'm so sorry.

204
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,339
Wait for me!

205
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,714
Please wait!

206
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,452
Oh, it's you.

207
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,590
NOT, "Oh, it's you."

208
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,218
If you don't give money to the ice cream
shop, you're stealing.

209
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,458
Money? What's money?

210
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,365
You don't know?

211
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,105
I haven't eaten delicious food
like this before.

212
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,505
You are quite ignorant of the world.

213
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,773
There is nothing which the
king doesn't know.

214
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,185
Everything you need is done by
your servants, isn't it?

215
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,791
From a certain point of view, you're pitiful.

216
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,926
Why?

217
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,962
You can't do anything by yourself alone,
and you can't become a mature adult.

218
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,130
Adult?

219
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,367
Yes, becoming an adult is a very important
thing for a human being.

220
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,203
Of course I know what being an adult is.

221
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,338
Really?

222
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,466
Adults do things like this, don't they?

223
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,970
What the hell are you doing?!

224
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:52,081
What are you angry about? Women in my
harem are happy when I do that.

225
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,844
Harem?

226
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,080
If I do this, they jump around for joy.

227
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,180
And then, if I...

228
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,487
This isn't your harem!

229
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,495
I won't lose at tag. Wait, wait, wait!


230
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,556
Pretty fast, aren't you? Wait!

231
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:13,839
Hey!

232
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,940
Ryo!

233
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,908
Kaori, what are you doing?

234
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,346
Help me, Ryo. I'm being assaulted
by the king!

235
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,608
Assaulted?

236
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,719
Nice to see you again, you little rat.

237
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,287
What are you doing to me? Let me go.

238
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,056
Listen to my orders. Let go! Let go, let go!

239
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,650
Do you think you can order me
to do whatever you want?

240
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,063
Thank you, Ryo.

241
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,998
What are you doing? This is just
like a running target.

242
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,334
But...

243
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,138
Help me! These are kidnappers!

244
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,940
The king is about to be kidnapped!

245
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,074
Hey, hey, what are you talking
about all of the sudden?!
The king is about to be kidnapped!

246
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,242
Hey, hey, what are you talking
about all of the sudden?!
Everybody, help me!

247
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,378
He's just kidding, just a joke.
Everybody, help me!

248
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,539
This is a simple argument between
parents and a kid.

249
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,407
It's true! Really, it's true.

250
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,744
Look, they have very similar facial
features, don't they?

251
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,687
Their perverted characters
are exactly the same!

252
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,086
Who can be similar to a kid like this?!

253
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,419
Why me?!

254
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,893
Ah, wait!

255
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,333
Are you all right?

256
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,664
Of course not!

257
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,740
What do we do? I can't find him!

258
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,675
That is bad. Kaori, look for him
in that direction.

259
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,703
Damn!

260
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,756
There he is.

261
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,590
Hey!

262
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,391
What?

263
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,949
Bathroom. Hurry up.

264
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,532
Don't treat me so roughly. It's gonna leak.

265
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,193
That's why I'm hurrying!

266
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,132
Hey, hurry up and pull down my pants!
I can't hold it any longer!

267
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,838
Do you let other people do things like that?

268
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:03,382
Yes, this is the job of the women in
my harem. Hurry up and do it!

269
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,316
Harem?

270
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,684
Kodama Hospital

271
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,922
Gramps, I came here to see you.

272
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,294
Oh, Your Majesty, it's my great pleasure

273
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,388
to have you come all the way
here to see me.

274
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,865
On my way here, I ate something
called ice cream.

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,669
It was very delicious.

276
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,472
I'm sorry, but I need to have
a word with the old man.

277
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,740
Mr. Saeba, have you decided to accept?

278
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,038
Don't rush. We have to talk first.

279
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,919
I wonder what they are talking about?

280
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,117
Is it true?

281
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,894
It is true.

282
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,697
In the harem of Prince Nalio, there are
about one hundred young ladies

283
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,665
who average around twenty years of age.

284
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,862
One hundred women!

285
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:02,207
If you invite me there, I would do
anything for Prince Nalio.

286
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:06,111
It's a piece of cake to do so, if you
will protect Prince Nalio.

287
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,046
Yes, we have a deal.

288
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,516
However, this has to be kept secret
from Kaori and Saeko.

289
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,505
Sure.

290
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,117
Saeko, I will take care of Nalio.

291
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,130
What's the matter? I know you
hate him with a passion.

292
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,432
Well, I'm a man, and I can't leave a kid
who is in such great danger alone.

293
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,703
You aren't asking me for any
mokkori this time?

294
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,899
I told you. I accept this job as a man.

295
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,258
Come in.

296
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,503
It's time to take your medication.

297
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,528
Wow, a mokkori nurse!

298
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,931
Man, he's always like that.

299
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,713
Then, see you later.

300
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,547
Ms. Nurse, would you have some
tea with me, please?

301
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,721
I guess not.

302
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,120
What a naughty hand!

303
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,956
If you want to be a bad boy, come with me.

304
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,324
Oh, Ryo, where are you going?

305
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,265
Gramps, want your medicine now?

306
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,369
Yes.

307
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,742
What is that?

308
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,731
Don't touch it!

309
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,246
Get down!

310
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,042
Prince Nalio!

311
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,420
That nurse...

312
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,323
Gramps, I'm scared!

313
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,589
It's all right. Gramps is right here.

314
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:09,901
Come with me.

315
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,536
What are you doing? Let me go!

316
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,638
Mr. Saeba?!

317
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,472
Ryo?!

318
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,674
Those women are professionals.

319
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,770
It looks like they declared
war on us via grenade.

320
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,181
For now, I am going to adopt this boy.
Nobody should follow us.

321
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,351
Let me go! Gramps, do something!

322
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,519
Prince Nalio!

323
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,089
Mr. Gliss, there's no need to worry
if we leave things to him.

324
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,056
But...

325
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,428
You were the one who told us that you want
Prince Nalio to be independent as a man.

326
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,589
That's why I recommended him.

327
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,661
I understand, but...

328
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,405
Let me go! If you don't, your head
will be cut off!

329
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,032
Be quiet!

330
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,881
Where are we going?

331
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,282
School.

332
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,579
School?

333
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,946
Yes, a school for men.

334
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,635
Guitar o kikase ta katta

335
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:20,332
Ai o todoke ta katta

336
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:26,233
Omoi ga tsutae rare na katta

Boku ga sumu kono machi o,

Moshi, ano toki ga, furui renga no machi

340
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,443

Toki ga tomatta mama no boku no kokoro o

Nikai date no bus ga oi koshite yuku

345
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,286
What are you going to do after
taking Prince Nalio?

346
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,687
I'll train him a little.

347
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,424
He is the king, so he can't be a
spoiled kid forever, can he?

348
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,493
Training to be independent?! Great!

349
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,162
There's nobody living up in these mountains,

350
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,897
so I'm great because I'm working
hard without any girls.

351
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,764
What the hell?!

352
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,168
Please! Please bring lots of girls when
