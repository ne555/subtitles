1
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,977
Looking straight down at the illumination

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,554
The escalator is ascending into the night

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:39,900
A river of headlights runs through the
valley of the frozen buildings

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,207
At first, I liked his voice

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,011
Then, his back and perfect fingers

6
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,017
His habit, he sometimes becomes so quiet

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,594
His mind, which goes somewhere, melody

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,190
Angel voice, I call his name and
try to hear something, echo

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,462
Shining smile, flower petals which are
blown off by the wind, kiss

10
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:16,798
Angel voice, a new but familiar echo

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:28,349
Shining smile, don't hurry and
just be yourself, kiss

12
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,776
We should be able to see
the island anytime now.

13
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,747
So soon?

14
00:01:54,747 --> 00:02:00,583
Why, I'd fly to the ends of the Earth, much
less a tropical island, for a beautiful client.

15
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,388
Ryo!

16
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,118
Don't move! I mean business!

17
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,417
You'd go anywhere, you say?
Does that include Hell?

18
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,661
Yes, if there's a chance for mokkori, sure.

19
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,928
So long, nice knowing you!

20
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,236
He's gone!

21
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,771
Ryo! We're going down! Do something!

22
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,042
Get the controls! The controls!

23
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,217
Okay!

24
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,020
It came off!

25
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,009
No way!

26
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,856
Kaori, hold onto me!

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,524
Don't let go!

28
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:55,563
Tropical Island Assignment
The Coconut Gal's Love Paradise

29
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,582
This is Okinohikari Island. It looks like
we made it all right.

30
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,458
Come on, Kaori, you can get down now.

31
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,824
I've had it. I'm exhausted.

32
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,063
The piercing cry of a woman in distress!
Over there!

33
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,896
Hey, Ryo!

34
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,073
Don't stop! Tear the place down!

35
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,551
Stop it! Stop!

36
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,078
Don't try it. It's coming down.
You could get hurt.

37
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,552
When you settle down, why don't
we talk, little girl?

38
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,627
That's a nice way to talk.

39
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,531
You're alive?!

40
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,869
Sorry, but I have the Devil's own luck.

41
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:35,705
I know, you're the jiageya from Tokyo
trying to buy up this island.

42
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm glad we cleared that up. Now go ahead
and sign this contract for me.

43
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,823
What the hell were you aiming at,
you little greenhorn?

44
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,303
Let's go!

45
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,451
Here you are.

46
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,351
Oh, thank you so much.

47
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,530
Not one electrical gadget, it's amazing.

48
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,998
An existence that's truly one with nature.

49
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,836
No radio, no TV, no electricity
on this island at all.

50
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,037
What are you doing?!

51
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:42,531
No, I was just seeing if she had a silk bra
or frilly panties or something.

52
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,713
You just got here, behave yourself!

53
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,521
That reminds me, I got an express letter
from my aunt in Tokyo.

54
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,959
She warned me that some jiageya are
after this island and to be careful.

55
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,063
That's right. That's why we came to help you.

56
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,199
But what are jiageya?

57
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,497
What? Well, jiageya are, well...

58
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,738
How to explain it? Jiageya are, see...

59
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,307
Is it some kind of shop that sells fried food?

60
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,642
I love fried fish balls,

61
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,203
but who would come to a deserted island like
this one to buy anything? Strange.

62
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,415
There's something funny about her.

63
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,417
She's just behind the times.

64
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,113
After all, she has been living on a
deserted island for three years.

65
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,987
She's not what I imagined.

66
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,025
I came all the way out here because
you said she was a tropical girl

67
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,827
living alone on a deserted island.

68
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:40,094
I was going to get close to her for some
mokkori under the tropical sun.

69
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,598
So that was your little plan?

70
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,945
See, Chihiro, those guys you just
ran into are called jiageya.

71
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,515
They do things like bringing wads of cash
to make you sell your land,

72
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,642
and forcing the people living there off of it.

73
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,684
Oh, I see. Well, there's no way
they're getting this island.

74
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,525
You see, this island is a treasure house
of rare species.

75
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:12,225
There are many rare birds, animals and
even plants living here.

76
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:17,827
My grandfather, a biologist, bought this
island to preserve the natural environment.

77
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,673
Later, he learned that with enough research,

78
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,574
he could have this island designated
a wildlife sanctuary.

79
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,543
My grandfather brought me to play here
when I was a little girl,

80
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,311
and I fell completely in love with it.

81
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,447
And so, you are carrying on with
your grandfather's research.

82
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,783
Yes, I'll continue until the island is
made a wildlife sanctuary.

83
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,086
I'll give you all the help I can.

84
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,031
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.
But I have one favor to ask.

85
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,000
What is it?! If it's a date you want,
I'd be delighted!

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,968
Or is it helping you sleep on
some lonely night, maybe?

87
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,233
Please don't use that dangerous thing here.

88
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,007
Not that! Not that!

89
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,480
You mean this.

90
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,241
You'll frighten the animals, so please...

91
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,153
Ok, I got you.

92
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,621
Just keep these for me then.

93
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,823
Sorry, I hope you'll forgive me.

94
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,988
It's okay. But I have a favor
of my own to ask in return.

95
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,522
What could it be?

96
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,295
I want you to wear this low-cut bathing suit!

97
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,936
Ryo, where did you get such a thing?

98
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,275
There is nothing Ryo Saeba doesn't have!

99
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,675
Okay, put it on and let's go for a swim!

100
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,005
Is this really a bathing suit?

101
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,983
Even if I put it on, I'll be almost naked.

102
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,885
That's the point!

103
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,220
Wearing it will help you understand
the animals better!

104
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,245
No, you really think so?

105
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:47,755
Being naked means you're that much
closer to the animals, right?

106
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,924
Maybe you're right. I'll put it on then.

107
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,667
This feels a little small to me.

108
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,375
Ryo, I can't believe you.

109
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,739
Don't worry, it's fine! It's the latest fashion!

110
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,547
I'm in Heaven! In Heaven! This is great!
I love the great outdoors!

111
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,861
A net would be easier.

112
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,426
All I need to catch is enough for us to eat.

113
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,697
A net would catch too many fish.

114
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,266
I see, natural conservation at work.

115
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,244
This hurts!

116
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,451
There's no stimulation here!

117
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,931
It's too peaceful! A life without pachinko
or cabarets or dirty books...

118
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,592
I can't bear it! Somebody!

119
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,333
Stimulate me!

120
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,566
Then how about this for stimulation?

121
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,037
Oh! What's this?

122
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:16,848
This wonderful aroma, and the volume.
Such rare presence!

123
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,786
It's so hot!

124
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,649
Tropical heat penetrates the body!

125
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,294
A variety of fish extracts gives
this well-blended curry

126
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,763
a perfect flavor and richness!

127
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,823
Delicious!

128
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,802
The light flavor of the white fish
is perfect for curry!

129
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,604
And the taste of this fresh shrimp is...

130
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,707
is an event in itself!

131
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,476
What's more, this rice is incredible!

132
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,479
I've never had rice that smells
like the ocean before!

133
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,503
How is it possible?

134
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,818
Simple! I washed the rice in sea water!

135
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:04,191
What unbelievable genius! This is the
definitive seafood curry! Bravo!

136
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,060
Since when did this show become
a gourmet manga?

137
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,568
You were as bad as I was!

138
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,382
Man! Why do I have to make
a fire with a stick?

139
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,017
Ryo, that girl's already fast asleep.

140
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,256
Stop scaring me!

141
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,167
The sun goes down and bang, she's out
like a light. I can't believe it.

142
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,465
That's no way for a girl just this
side of twenty to be.

143
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,166
This kind of life's not bad
for a change of pace.

144
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,976
I've got withdrawal symptoms here.
I'm homesick for neon signs.

145
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,311
Listen to you.

146
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,007
Oh! Look over there! A neon sign!

147
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,612
You're kidding.

148
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,420
That has to be my beloved cabaret! Yeah!

149
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,887
Hey! Wait, Ryo!

150
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,256
It can't be.

151
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,376
Look at that! Those are all crystals!

152
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,484
They're sparkling like that because
they're catching the moonlight.

153
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,658
You mean it isn't a cabaret?

154
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,125
Of course not!

155
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,955
I guess this is what those
jiageya are really after.

156
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,623
They want to dig up the crystals
and sell them.

157
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,262
I bet this island is just full of crystals.

158
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,739
They couldn't just come in here
and dig them all up

159
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,934
without getting some kind of permission.

160
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,841
That's why they're using strong-arm tactics
to make her sell the island instead.

161
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,109
A mining operation would spell disaster
for the island's natural environment!

162
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,293
They've forgotten that man is
a part of nature too.

163
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,774
Sometimes you say some
impressive things, Ryo.

164
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,505
Ryo?!

165
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,379
That's right! People are
a part of nature too.

166
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,018
And nothing's more natural
than some night loving!

167
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:49,255
Obeying your instincts, then, goes hand in
hand with living as one with nature.

168
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:51,897
Oh! That's Chihiro!

169
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,025
No doubt she can't sleep and
is enjoying the evening air.

170
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,595
However, sweating with me
would be much nicer!

171
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,936
Chihiro!

172
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,011
Yo!

173
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,616
Umibozu!

174
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,611
Umibozu! What are you doing here?

175
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:21,126
Your client heard about Ryo's reputation
and became uneasy,

176
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,295
so she hired me as a guard.

177
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,798
Man, no one trusts me.

178
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,299
Especially your lower half.

179
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,493
I can accept that.

180
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,261
It's a good thing I was here.
That was a close call.

181
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,073
Close call?

182
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,843
You mean Ryo was trying to pay
Chihiro a little visit?!

183
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,678
No, you got it wrong!

184
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,202
Don't waste your breath!

185
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,017
Sleep there tonight!

186
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,543
Get up, Mr. Saeba! It's morning!

187
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,210
My, Mr. Saeba, you sure got
a lot bigger in one night.

188
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,989
No, no, Ryo's over there.
That's his friend, Umibozu.

189
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,218
Oh, are you a Buddhist priest?

190
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,324
Well, he's something like that.

191
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,894
Is it morning already?

192
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,870
What time is it?

193
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,242
Come on, when the sun rises, you get up.
That's the natural way.

194
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,006
Okay, I'll wash my face. Got any toothpaste?

195
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,013
What's that?

196
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,275
It's salt.

197
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:55,146
Man, I'm sleepy. Six o'clock, we're
usually still in bed at this hour.

198
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,290
What kind of place is this anyway?

199
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,493
Can't even use toothpaste cause
it'll pollute the ocean.

200
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,960
I like it here.

201
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,964
How so?

202
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,366
There aren't any crummy animals
like cats here.

203
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,334
That's what I love about it.

204
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,061
Look! Look! Isn't it cute?!

205
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,602
A cat!

206
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,548
Oh, no! I forgot Umibozu can't stand cats.

207
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,346
It's not a cat. It's a caracal cub.

208
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,816
A relative of the cats, I see.

209
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,996
They're here.

210
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,785
They intend to use force if necessary.

211
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,582
How can you just sit there, Ryo?

212
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,857
They're coming in large numbers!
What are you going to do?!

213
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,324
The island's in danger!

214
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,727
No problem, Umibozu has
everything in hand.

215
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,967
What happened?!

216
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,141
Excellent!

217
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,268
What?! You mean that pitfall was...

218
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,472
I made them last night, nothing better to do.

219
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,881
I got traps set all over the place.

220
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,221
Of course, Saeba told me not to harm
the natural environment.

221
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,485
So I limited myself wherever possible
to primitive designs.

222
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,363
Time to finish this I guess.

223
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:53,698
Who the hell?! You guys?
You're the ones who did this!

224
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,231
Hold it there! You better look over here!

225
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,980
You've caused us a lot of trouble here,
but that's all over now.

226
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,507
We get this little girl here to sign the
contract, and that'll be that.

227
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,412
Mr. Saeba!

228
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,255
Ryo!

229
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,223
Umibozu! I'm leaving them to you!

230
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,732
That's right!

231
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,124
In there?

232
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,976
What's wrong?! Go ahead and shoot!

233
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,873
Stop shooting! There aren't any
bullets in Mr. Saeba's gun!

234
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,324
What's that? A trick to get me off my guard?

235
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,417
Give it up. I'm not falling for some
stupid trick like that.

236
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,631
It's true. Not one bullet, alas.

237
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,997
But a worm like you doesn't have
a chance of hurting me!

238
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,463
You got a big mouth!
Why don't I just try then?!

239
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,809
Damn! You little brat!

240
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,874
Damn it!

241
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,157
Mr. Saeba!

242
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,659
Stay there! Don't move!

243
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,183
Damn you!

244
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,265
Come here.

245
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,701
Thank you.

246
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,733
I think he's taken a liking to you,
that little caracal.

247
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,363
It's from the Environmental Agency.

248
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,699
This island has been designated
a wildlife sanctuary!

249
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,759
You've done it! This natural paradise is safe!

250
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,603
Your efforts have been rewarded. Great!

251
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,542
Yes, and I've been appointed the
natural conservator for the island,

252
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,066
so my work continues.

253
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,513
And there you have it!
Understand, don't you?

254
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,879
You guys aren't going to be
coming back here ever again!

255
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:56,243
Yes, we understand! We're sorry!

256
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,812
Mr. Saeba, Kaori, thanks for all your help.

257
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,393
If you're ever in trouble, let me know.

258
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,759
Give me the three letters, XYZ,
and I'll come running.

259
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,145
You finally get to go home to Tokyo. Happy?

260
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,478
But it's hard leaving Chihiro.

261
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,685
Then why don't you just stay on the island?

262
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,393
Well, I have to say the city suits me best.

263
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:32,348
Darling, whenever I call you for a date,
you have an audition on that day

264
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,822
You are just like Faye Dunaway
who is competing only for rank

265
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,553
You skip dinner and eat diet food

266
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:47,692
Darling, I want to give you the answer
when you wish for something

267
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:52,104
Even if I do, you're not impressed, just get it

268
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,437
In front of your apartment, you say goodbye

269
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:02,541
Baby, you don't understand
what a real man is

270
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:11,620
Baby, I'm sure there aren't many
great men like me

271
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,525
Don't you, don't you know

272
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:19,898
Please understand, you'll find out
if you study a little

273
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:27,737
Baby, I got, love is the motion of life,
don't be depressed fourteen times

274
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,636
Real dance, chance,
romance, it's all up to you

275
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,553
Okay, okay, a police car's coming through.
Please open up a path.

276
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,587
What are you doing?! Hey!

277
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,556
Touring Tokyo with Machiko's father.

278
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,290
What?

279
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,292
After all, I'm Machiko's fianc

280
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,829
He'll see me working hard and
his worries will be put to rest.

281
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,264
In a police car?!

282
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,066
Listen well, policewoman Kaori.
I'm a detective.

283
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,501
Oh, my God!

284
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,836
City Hunter 2:

285
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,639
"A Dangerous Detective Before You Know It -
Welcome to Tokyo, Father!"

286
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,306
If you don't watch it...

287
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,603
I'll arrest you.

288
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:07,267
Please look forward to the next episode
