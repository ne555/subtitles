Escape in progress!

14
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,891
Let's go.

15
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,654
Wait a second, man!

16
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,690
Ryo is a Gourmet
Nice PR for the Soba Noodle Beauty

17
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,838
Shirako-Ya

18
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,261
I am so stuffed.

19
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,996
I don't think I can eat any more.

20
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,763
Mr. Saeba?

21
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,064
Yes?

22
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,566
Are you all right?

23
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,932
You don't really need to suffer like that.

24
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,970
What are you talking about, honey?

25
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,167
Your soba noodles are the best
in the world, Mika!

26
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,905
Hello...

27
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,886
She's cute.

28
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,513
Ryo's type!

29
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,391
Don't misunderstand, Kaori.

30
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,723
It's just a coincidence that I suddenly
wanted to eat soba noodles.

31
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,931
You eat soba noodles everyday, sabotaging
efforts to hand out our flyers.

32
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,633
But the soba noodles at this place
are really delicious.

33
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,100
Try one.

34
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,739
Disgusting...

35
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,974
How is it?!

36
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,209
It must be delicious!

37
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,944
Delicious, isn't it?

38
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,612
Oh, I see.

39
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,012
You're so impressed and speechless
because it's so delicious.

40
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,379
I guess I respect his efforts for
trying to get mokkori.

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,845
It's all right.

42
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,716
I already know that my soba noodles
are no good.

43
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,228
But this is the best I can do now.

44
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:53,389
With my skill, it's impossible to
create my mother's taste.

45
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,869
This restaurant, which my mother
worked hard for and protected,

46
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,030
will be closed if customers don't come in.

47
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,074
That's not true.

48
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,910
The soba noodle I just ate was pretty good.

49
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,044
She's right.

50
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,313
If there are no other customers, I will...

51
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,783
I mean, we will come here every day
and eat a hundred servings.

52
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,118
Mr. Saeba!

53
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,178
Hey, what do you mean by "we"?

54
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,460
I have to use this wig until
my hair gets longer.

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,531
Sir, what are we doing at a place like this?

56
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,773
Our plan is to bust into a bank
and get some money.

57
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,709
If we flutter about too much, we might
attract people's attention.

58
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,919
Nothing has changed.

59
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,614
It's exactly the same as before.

60
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,760
Welcome!

61
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,468
What can I serve you today?

62
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,203
Zaru, two of them.

63
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,670
Sure!

64
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,205
Oh, I can't eat any more.

65
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,370
Eat! Eat with guts.

66
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,608
I understand, Sir.

67
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,208
You intend to rob this place before
we do the bank, don't you?

68
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,415
Why didn't you say so?

69
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,693
Excuse me, but are you related to
the lady who owns this place?

70
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,196
Sir, do you know my mother?

71
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,790
Not really.

72
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,234
Her daughter...

73
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,031
I guess I saw a little girl back then.

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,303
She... My mother passed away.

75
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,672
There was a car accident.

76
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,519
Sir, let's hurry up!

77
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,350
I will make a chance.

78
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,658
Sorry to keep you waiting.

79
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,286
Wow, now it's time to eat!

80
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:28,144
Lady, do you intend to get
paid for food like this?

81
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,225
That's right! We should get
paid for eating this.

82
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,214
Ouch!

83
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,529
It hurts.

84
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,996
Sir, what did you do to me?

85
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,604
Lady, nowadays, Chinese Ramen noodles
are very popular among people,

86
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:49,234
but I believe the Japanese soba noodle
contains the soul of the Japanese.

87
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,910
However, I'm sorry to tell you,
but this soba...

88
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,113
It's already dead.

89
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,580
Dead?

90
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,119
Excuse me, Sir, but isn't it a little rude

91
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,520
to say things like that without
eating even a bite?

92
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,427
I can tell that by just picking up
the noodles with chopsticks.

93
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,430
These soba noodles are different from
Sarashina-Soba powder,

94
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,034
and use a mix of the first, second and third
grind soba powder, the so-called grind mix.



95
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,902
That's okay, but the kneading
was weak, too weak.

96
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,941
Because of that, these soba noodles
are not strong enough.

97
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,637
Therefore, if you try to pick up a noodle
with chopsticks, it falls apart.

98
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,680
The dipping sauce and the noodles
are not well matched at all.

99
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,615
In order to make these noodles taste good,

100
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,742
the dipping sauce should have
a thicker taste.

101
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,253
The essence of the dipping sauce
needs more time,

102
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,823
and the dried tuna flake for the broth
needs to be shaved thicker,

103
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,586
then the sauce might be better.

104
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,026
Only a cockroach would eat
soba noodles like these.

105
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,326
I'm a cockroach.

106
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,572
Mr. Gondo!

107
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,706
Oh, what a scene!

108
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,976
It's a very rare occasion for me to see
customers in this restaurant.

109
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,443
What do you want?

110
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:03,316
My mother took care of this place very well
and I don't intend to give it up at all.

111
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,318
Please calm down.

112
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,954
Anyway, it's too hot inside this restaurant.

113
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,389
Why don't you take off your clothes?

114
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,856
Yes, Sir.

115
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,903
Hey, you laughed at us, didn't you?

116
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,370
I won't let you go!

117
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,773
Be prepared!

118
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,675
I don't think you can do things like that.

119
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,722
You will pay for this!

120
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,590
Don't underestimate the power of
a business man from Osaka.

121
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,092
Sir!

122
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,360
Idiots.

123
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,761
Well, shall we go?

124
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,888
Sir, it's time, isn't it?

125
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,091
Please wait!

126
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,542
Please accept me as your pupil.

127
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,375
I desperately want to create
the best soba in Japan.

128
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,914
Not only for my late mother,
but for myself too!

129
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,943
Please, please accept me.

130
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,386
Stop fooling around, girl.

131
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,389
We have to go and take care of
some big business now.

132
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,118
Well, let's go, Sir.

133
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,160
What's the matter?

134
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,395
Hurry up, let's go.

135
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,862
The bank will be closed soon.

136
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,459
Sir?

137
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,899
My way of teaching is very hard.

138
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,042
That was an incredible technique you
displayed a little while ago.

139
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,640
Would you please help us?

140
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,788
I don't have enough manpower to make
the flies leave this place.

141
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,558
No, I have a policy of not accepting
requests from men.

142
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,259
Ryo!

143
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,726
But...

144
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,031
If you promise me that I'll be able to eat
Mika's delicious soba noodles,

145
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,498
I might accept.

146
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,801
Mr. Saeba!

147
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,905
No, no!

148
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,033
Use more power and lean with
your entire weight!

149
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,443
What a mean guy!

150
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,547
No!

151
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,415
In order to create soba noodles
with a good consistency,

152
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,007
the most important thing is power.

153
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,218
Yes, Sir!

154
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,243
Wow, she really hangs in there!

155
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,958
Two inmates who escaped
from Kanto Prison,

156
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,224
Torakichi Kurebayashi and Akira Hirata,
are still on the loose.

157
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,732
Akira Hirata robbed Kansai Bank two years
ago and was subsequently captured.

158
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,434
Oh, right! My women's wrestling show
is about to start.
Akira Hirata robbed Kansai Bank two years
ago and was subsequently captured.

159
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,736
Oh right! My women's wrestling show
is about to start.
He is suspected in another five cases and...

160
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,464
He is suspected in another five cases and...

161
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,824
Look what they've done!

162
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,867
Ryo, they're the guys who came here earlier.

163
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,732
It's too much! Too cruel!

164
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,536
I won't give up!

165
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,306
I will not give up because of
something like this!

166
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,773
Absolutely not!

167
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,115
Athletic Club

168
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:38,763
Scattering sweat, fresh bodies, this is the
extreme mokkori I've been seeking!

169
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,868
Oh, God, I thank you that you
gave me life in this world!

170
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,996
Well, well, Mika!

171
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,635
Fight, fight, fight...

172
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,603
Fight, fight, fight...

173
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,777
Fight, fight, fight...

174
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,892
Finally, I finished cleaning up the trash.

175
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,293
Anyway, I wonder how long
he intends to stay here?

176
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,072
Last night, you recognized us
while you were watching TV,

177
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,040
and you changed the channel, didn't you?

178
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,743
I would like to ask you why.

179
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,643
I don't know.

180
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,847
Just like you can tell whether the soba
noodles are good or bad at a glance,

181
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,816
I can tell whether the person is really a
bad person or not, just by looking at him.

182
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,918
I think there's a story behind
what you're doing here.

183
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,217
You look a little odd because you
concentrate on Mika so much.

184
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,659
Obligations...

185
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,129
I am deeply indebted to her mother.

186
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,758
A long time ago, I killed someone because
of an obligation from my gambler's life.

187
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,133
Well, it's been ten years ago now.

188
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,775
I had been running away from the
police, running and running,

189
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,504
and the place I ended up was
the restaurant, Shirako-Ya.

190
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:15,058
That lady was just beautiful.
She was there just being beautiful.

191
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:40,919
Damn!

192
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,792
Honestly speaking, at that time,
I couldn't decide what to do.

193
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,989
The reason I jumped in there
was to find hostages.

194
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,603
Anyway, I lost.

195
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,070
I don't know why.

196
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,706
I lost a fight for the first time
since I was born.

197
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,907
Mommy!

198
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,097
By coincidence, I heard from an inmate
friend that she had passed away.

199
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,072
Before I realized what I was doing,
I had escaped from the prison.

200
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,539
This is what happened.

201
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,381
Damn, no, no!

202
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,084
You'll never be able to create good broth if
you keep shaving dried fish like that.

203
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,881
Shave them thicker!

204
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,187
Yes, Sir.

205
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,422
Why the hell do I need to do things like this?

206
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,653
I was once called a genius bank robber.

207
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,663
This is perfect!

208
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,101
Hey, Ryo, don't you think it
might be a good idea

209
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,869
to have some advertisement
for this restaurant?

210
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,605
Yes, these times require advertisement.

211
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,773
Shall we distribute flyers or something?

212
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:08,741
No way.

213
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,442
It seems like it's not working at all.

214
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,610
Actually, we did it for our business,

215
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,339
but Saeba Company doesn't have
any clients at all.

216
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,613
Advertisement...

217
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,685
No! How many times do I have to tell you?!

218
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,729
What's the matter?

219
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,365
I can quit doing this right now.

220
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,335
Hey, man, aren't you too hard on her?

221
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,270
It's okay, Ms. Kaori.

222
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,737
It's all my fault.

223
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,966
I'm sorry. I have to go shopping.

224
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,047
She's out now.

225
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,344
Good, get her!

226
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,558
That voice!

227
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,862
Sir!

228
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,725
Oh, no! Mika's been kidnapped!

229
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:14,297
I'm sorry, but I want you to sign a contract.

230
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,270
It's that guy, the other man who
was at Shirako-Ya.

231
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,379
What the hell?!

232
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,850
Damn! Run over him!

233
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,870
Get out of the car!

234
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,277
Bastard!

235
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,791
Can't you see this?

236
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,782
If you come any closer to me,
I'm gonna shoot her.

237
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,240
Promise me.

238
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,208
You'll never ever even try to
contact Shirako-Ya.

239
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,511
I promise!

240
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,745
Please forgive me!

241
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,113
Good boy.

242
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,082
The next time I see you, you'll be dead.

243
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,151
Yes, Sir!

244
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,882
Mr. Saeba! I... I...

245
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,460
Shall we go back?

246
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,519
Everybody is waiting for your soba noodles.

247
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,654
Mr. Saeba...

248
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,395
Yes, I'll do my best!

249
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,575
At last, this is the final test for Ms. Mika.

250
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,891
Torakichi is late.

251
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,018
He told me that he was going to
buy a pack of cigarettes.

252
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,237
Hello...

253
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,643
This is headquarters.

254
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:35,101
Rush to the noodle restaurant Shirako-Ya,
locating at Hanada-Cho, 3.

255
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,739
Finished!

256
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,010
It looks so good!

257
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,910
Time to eat now!

258
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,816
Holy cow!

259
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,551
We don't have time to eat soba.

260
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,786
We have to hurry up and run!

261
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,152
I don't care. Go by yourself.

262
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,488
After coming this far, you ain't a man
if you don't eat!

263
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,227
To hell with it all!

264
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,606
Delicious!

265
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,335
Really! So good!

266
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,404
It's really good!

267
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,584
This is the final version of Japanese food!

268
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:51,190
The pride of Japan, the final
Japanese soba noodle,

269
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,457
better than a mother's handmade cooking!

270
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,435
Well...

271
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,969
Ms. Mika, would you please
promise me one thing?

272
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,081
Sure!

273
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,915
When Akira and I leave the restaurant,
please do not look outside.

274
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,158
What's going on, Ryo?

275
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,785
It's getting noisy outside.

276
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,491
Wait for me, Sir!

277
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,968
Wait, please wait.

278
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,698
Please tell me about my soba noodles.
Is my soba still a failure?

279
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,708
Please take me.

280
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,685
You, the last time I nabbed you was at this
same noodle restaurant, wasn't it?

281
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,947
You're strange.

282
00:20:55,654 --> 00:21:00,387
Well, the soba noodles at this restaurant
were so good that I forget to run away.

283
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,924
The soba noodles at this restaurant
are the best in Japan!

284
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,566
Sir, thank you so much.

285
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,973
Sir, promise me!

286
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,677
The next time we break out of this place,
we're gonna rob a bank!

287
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,679
Well, let me think about it.

288
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,048
Anyway, it was in the blood.

289
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,517
Her soba noodles were so good,
as good as her mother's!

290
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,351
Sir, please do not talk about soba
noodles, never ever again!

291
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,232
Here you go.

292
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,100
Welcome!

293
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,670
Sir...

294
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,073
What can I get for you today?

295
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,446
Escaped inmates forgot to run because the
soba noodles at Shirako-Ya were so good!

296
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,440
Are you saying that Torakichi
was caught on purpose?

297
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:05,655
Yes, in order to create the best
advertisement for the restaurant.

298
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,856
I see. He might have done it for that purpose.

299
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,595
Shall we go, Kaori?

300
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,062
Wait for me, Ryo.

301
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,837
Mr. Torakichi, I'm pretty sure that
her mother in Heaven

302
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,805
understood what you've been feeling.

303
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:32,748

315
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,519
There is an orphanage which has
been forced to vacate.

316
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,953
Can't we help them somehow?

317
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,389
I have to prepare for Christmas
so I'm going to pass.

318
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,558
I know you're thinking something
really stupid.

319
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm so sorry, but I'm busy.

320
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,629
You can take care of a problem
like that by yourself.

321
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,197
I see. I understand.

322
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,533
I will do anything to help them,
even become a thief.

323
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,401
Hey, don't do something illegal.

324
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,235
Leave me alone!

325
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,537
City Hunter 2:

326
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,907
"To Kaori From Ryo

327

won't come to you!

328
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,868
Please look forward to the next episode
