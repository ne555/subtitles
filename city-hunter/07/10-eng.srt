00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Piasu de kimetari, hade na mini o sagashitari

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Biru no kabe ni boys, hora,
koukishin ga machibuse

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Heart o game ni shite shimae

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
Shitai koto bakari aru nara,
dekiru koto hajimete

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
Day by day, ii ja nai, okay nani kara demo

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
Dakishimerarereba, hohoemi o
taisetsu ni dekiru kara

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
Day by day, ii ja nai, all right
watashi wa mou

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
Kono mune no pazuru,
hajime no hitotsu kizuiteru

9
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,040
Not like that. When you kiss someone,
you should close your eyes.

10
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,145
This can't be!

11
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,875
Ryo and I kissing?

12
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,278
This isn't a dream.

13
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,687
Ryo is trying to kiss me.

14
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,516
Ryo is... with me!

15
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,426
Why is this happening to me?

16
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,058
Why?

17
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,034
With me?

18
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,263
My Love For Tonight Only
Cinderella Story in the City

19
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,178
Yes, if I hadn't seen Eriko then...

20
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,013
Wow! This one looks great.
Yes, if I hadn't seen Eriko then...

21
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,214
Wow! This one looks great.

22
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,483
Hey, look! Look at that one, Ryo!

23
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,577
This one... I wish I could wear it just once.

24
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:39,224
Are you going to go buy it or not? Hurry up
and decide. I'm waiting for you.

25
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,763
What? You promised to go shopping
with me today, didn't you?

26
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,599
You already bought so much.
I think that's enough.

27
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,863
That one looks good too!

28
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,815
It looks so pretty. I can't stop
sighing just looking at it.

29
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,976
Do you like this one, Kaori?

30
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,984
Really, Kaori! It's me!

31
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,693
Eriko?!

32
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,128
Long time no see!

33
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,730
Really! How long has it been
since I last saw you?

34
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,632
Kaori, you haven't changed a bit.

35
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,234
You too, Eriko.

36
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,795
No, you're even more beautiful than
when you were in high school!

37
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,141
Kaori, are you shopping by yourself?

38
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,542
No, well, I have someone with me...

39
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,113
What? Ryo?

40
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,082
Miss!

41
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,107
Hey, let's have a cup of tea together.

42
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,554
Hey, wait a sec.

43
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,887
Doesn't he have anything better to do
than to chase women?

44
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,455
He's pretty cute, isn't he?
Is he your lover, Kaori?

45
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:56,536
Oh, no. No way, not that jerk.

46
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,766
He's sort of a co-worker.

47
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,664
That's it.

48
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,612
Incredible!

49
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,714
I didn't know that this is your shop.

50
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,084
Yes, though my parents helped me
with most of it.

51
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,350
Your high school dream of becoming
a fashion designer came true.

52
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,958
If you find anything you like,
just let me know.

53
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,728
It's okay. I'll take you upstairs
and totally coordinate it.

54
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,821
Totally coordinate?

55
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,638
Once you change your looks suddenly,
your boyfriend will die from love!

56
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,074
He's not my boyfriend.
I already told you that.

57
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:40,413
Stop pretending. Your taste hasn't
changed a bit since high school.

58
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,081
Is that so?

59
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,912
You look good with that on.

60
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,888
But I'm a bit embarrassed wearing
feminine clothes like these.

61
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,685
No you're not.

62
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,989
This one might be better.

63
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,864
Eriko, you love taking care
of others like this.

64
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,491
You're just the same as you used to be.

65
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,197
We're even now, aren't we?

66
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:09,169
Hey, hey, it's just a cup of tea.
It's not a big deal, is it? Hey!

67
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,601
Really! What a pest!

68
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,211
Are you all right?

69
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,265
How gentle you are! How beautiful
your smile is!

70
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,928
This must be fate! Why don't we
go out for dinner together?

71
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,470
You never learn, do you?

72
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,307
All right.

73
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,775
What? Really?!

74
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,440
But not right now.

75
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,918
Tonight at 7 o'clock, at Sunrise Hill.
How about that?

76
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,419
Sunrise Hill?

77
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,721
One more thing.

78
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,524
I don't want to go out with someone
who dresses like a geek.

79
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,186
Wear these and make sure you come
looking a bit better. See you.

80
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,423
What?

81
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,124
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kaori.

82
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,542
Where have you been, Eriko?

83
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,917
I put on so much makeup that
I don't feel like myself.

84
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,619
What are you talking about?!

85
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,455
This is your real beauty.

86
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,024
You just haven't recognized it yet.

87
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,126
No way!

88
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes, way.

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,687
Put this on.

90
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,728
You look great, Kaori!
See, look in the mirror.

91
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,504
Me? My real beauty?

92
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,056
Hey, Kaori, do you realize it?

93
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,556
The eyes of the men in the room...

94
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:17,262
All of them are looking at you.
They're all crazy about you.

95
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,872
What do you think?

96
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,774
You say so, but...

97
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,911
If you like someone in here,
why don't you ask him out?

98
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,113
You might be able to get lucky
with a marriage.

99
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,048
Don't be ridiculous! I don't want to.

100
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,353
Then I guess you have someone
in mind already, don't you?

101
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,253
Is the mokkori guy I saw a
little while ago the one?

102
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,380
No way!

103
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,257
There's no way he's it.

104
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:47,900
You're being silly, Kaori. You won't be able
to claim his heart that way.

105
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,436
You need more self-confidence.

106
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,236
You have to go for it when the time comes,
or you'll regret it later.

107
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,536
Eriko...

108
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,746
Well...

109
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,714
Excuse me, but I need to go
to the bathroom.

110
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,593
I'm going to disappear now.
It's almost 7 o'clock.

111
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,826
Good luck, Kaori!

112
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,039
She's late. I wonder what she's doing?

113
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,166
Your friend already went home.

114
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,509
Oh, no, without telling me?

115
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,821
Excuse me, but I couldn't stop myself
from speaking to you.

116
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,120
You're so beautiful, as if you
were Aphrodite herself.

117
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,727
Who are you?

118
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,389
Would you please accept this
present from me?

119
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,028
Roses!

120
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,629
Next to you, nothing compares to your
beauty, not even these roses.

121
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,541
Let me buy you a drink.

122
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,669
No, thank you. I'm going home now.

123
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,503
Wait.

124
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,483
You are my gravity.

125
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:15,087
Just as the Moon stands beside the Earth,
I won't be far from you, ever.

126
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,691
Disgusting! Who the hell is this guy?!

127
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,261
Just one drink then, and I mean only one.

128
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,523
My pleasure.

129
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,036
Please.

130
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,264
Thank you.

131
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,462
To our encounter.

132
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,107
Cheers.

133
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,131
Cheers.

134
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,619
Ryo!

135
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,712
What's he doing here?!

136
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,780
You! Why did you do that for no reason?!

137
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,628
That's what I wanted to ask you about.

138
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,859
You put a sleeping pill in her drink.
What are you going to do now?

139
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,995
I abhor violence!

140
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,844
Really! These days,

141
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,714
even a high school girl wouldn't be
fooled by such an obvious trick.

142
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,250
You weren't being very careful and
that's why he tried that on you.

143
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,987
What are you talking about? You...

144
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,787
Or might you be a young lady who knows
little about the real world?

145
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,895
The clothes you're wearing appear
to be of high quality.

146
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,265
It's not good for a lady like you to be
in such a place so late at night.

147
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,702
He... He doesn't recognize me?

148
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,535
How about spending some time with me?

149
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:45,300
I was waiting for somebody here,
but I guess I've been forgotten.

150
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,536
Waiting for somebody?

151
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,778
I see, Eriko was...

152
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,956
First of all, I'm sure that Ryo wouldn't
dress like this himself.

153
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,619
Eriko planned to set Ryo and me
up on a date together.

154
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,394
She puts her nose in everything.

155
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:13,003
But I can't believe that this jerk
doesn't recognize me!

156
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,771
Well, if you don't want to, it's okay.

157
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,925
You're a daughter who ran away from home?

158
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:38,164
Yes, I wanted to see the outside world
by myself for once.

159
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:42,624
If someone from my family finds me,
I'll be taken back home immediately.

160
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,001
Would you please protect me and prevent
me from being taken back?

161
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,909
Just for one day, today.

162
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:54,005
I want to have a memory of freedom.

163
00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:01,287
You're lucky to have met me. It'll be
my pleasure to help you.

164
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,312
Really?! Thank you!

165
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:19,067
I can't believe it's really happening.
Ryo and I are on a date.

166
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,043
My name is Ryo Saeba. I'm twenty years old.

167
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,671
Twenty years old? You're still lying like that?

168
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,350
Nothing. You're younger than
you look, Ryo...

169
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,120
Mr. Saeba, aren't you?

170
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,112
Call me Ryo, just as if we were lovers.

171
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,158
Lovers?

172
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:44,152
We'll be lovers just for tonight.

173
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,856
Lovers just for tonight...

174
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,126
Well, I'll go with you anywhere
you want to, my lady.

175
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,133
Anywhere would be...

176
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:59,704
I have a good idea, Ryo! Please take me
somewhere you'd like to go.

177
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,114
Hotel 91

178
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,917
He can't think of anything other than this?!

179
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,925
You're in luck. There are
two vacancies tonight.

180
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,661
Let's go.

181
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,699
Oh, no, I can't believe I'm with Ryo
in a hotel like this.

182
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,677
Hotel?

183
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,380
Ryo...

184
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,180
Kaori...

185
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,722
No, no! What was I thinking?!

186
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:48,360
Excuse me, but is this the place
you like going to?

187
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,622
It sure is.

188
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,022
What is this place for?

189
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,671
You know, right?

190
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,740
What? I have no idea.

191
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,110
Well, then, I'm going to give you a hint.

192
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,278
Ta-da!

193
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,080
Wow!

194
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,810
What a gorgeous bathroom!

195
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,880
That jerk! I can't believe he wallows
in such luxury all the time.

196
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,292
Let's take a bath and clean you up!

197
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,928
And wash here and wash there...

198
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,563
I get it!

199
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,155
This is a spa, isn't it?

200
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,439
Please use this to cool yourself off with.

201
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,428
Ah, thanks.

202
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,069
Are you all right?

203
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,276
Smothered...

204
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,584
Shall we watch TV?

205
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,323
Damn, this is getting worse and worse.

206
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,942
Mokkori!

207
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:10,738
Crap!

208
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,334
Mokkori sexy thighs!

209
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,982
Fire!

210
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,947
Ryo, are you all right?

211
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,066
I'm glad it turned out to be a small fire.

212
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,728
I lost a very rare chance.

213
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,036
Did I go a bit too far?

214
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,746
Well, let's go.

215
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,180
Let's start the date over again.

216
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,861
Right! Go! Go!

217
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,195
We're walking together just like
real lovers! Ryo and I...

218
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,626
Ryo and I...

219
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,697
I?

220
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,545
Is something wrong?

221
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,379
No, nothing...

222
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,918
Hey, Ryo, why don't we go to
a disco and dance?!

223
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,957
Ryo's smiling at me.

224
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,237
But it's not really me!

225
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,003
Ryo is not dating me.

226
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,808
It's not me.

227
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,550
Well, it's time for a slow dance now.

228
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,364
But...

229
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,268
Ryo is not really holding me.

230
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,532
I...

231
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,910
I...

232
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,043
What kind of stupid thing am I doing?

233
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:12,589
If I knew that I felt this way, I would've
told him that it's me.

234
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:18,452
But if he learns that it's me,
Ryo's smile will disappear.

235
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,202
I'm going to put a stop to this.

236
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,641
Are you not feeling well?
You've been awfully quiet.

237
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,302
Oh, it's nothing.

238
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:36,482
Before we came here, I made a reservation
at the hotel over there.

239
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,882
I doubt there'll be any more fires today.

240
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:44,056
I'll warm you up in a nice room where
we can look at the sea. Let's go.

241
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,391
Wait, wait a second.

242
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,494
Well, I...

243
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,827
Have to go! It's close to midnight.

244
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,133
I...

245
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,169
I'm leaving Japan tonight. That's right!

246
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,471
I'm going to school abroad.

247
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,239
Going to school abroad?

248
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:00,672
Yeah, that's right.
Going to school abroad?

249
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,206
Yeah, that's right.

250
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,506
I have to be on board a ship that's leaving
port shortly after midnight. It's that one.

251
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,914
If it was such an important thing,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

252
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,949
Because I was having too much fun, so...

253
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,057
I couldn't tell you that I'd have to
say goodbye at midnight.

254
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,825
I see. I've finally learned your real name.

255
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,098
You're Cinderella, aren't you?

256
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,070
Just like Cinderella,

257
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,473
the magic will disappear and you'll have
to return to being the real you.

258
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,974
The magic will disappear.

259
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,182
Thank you, Ryo,

260
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,777
for giving me a wonderful memory of
freedom before I leave Japan.

261
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,214
I won't forget about tonight, ever.

262
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,959
Midnight, it's the farewell bell.

263
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:17,515
Not like that. When you kiss someone,
you should close your eyes.

264
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,609
Ryo and I kissing?

265
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,420
But Ryo isn't kissing me as me.

266
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,382
No, I don't like it.

267
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,555
But... but...

268
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,658
But!

269
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,612
Magic time is over.

270
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,574
The bell has finished ringing, Cinderella.

271
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,354
Goodbye, Ryo.

272
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,901
And then you came home?!

273
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,412
What an idiot!

274
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,417
Don't you understand why I went
through all that trouble?

275
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,647
It's okay, like this...

276
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,720
I'm...

277
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,826
I'm me.

278
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:47,939
I'm sorry, Eriko. I lost one of
the earrings somewhere.

279
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,464
It's okay. It wasn't that expensive.

280
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:57,345
Kaori, what are you talking about?
What's that in your pocket?

281
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,520
This is it. Why is this in here?

282
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,706
Cinderella in the city...

283
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:43,155
If you're feeling kazari bakari ki ni shite mo

Kono te ni yasuragi o, starting over

Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

290
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,712
Heart and heart, kono toki o

291
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:45,619
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

292
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,457
Heart and heart, kono toki o

293
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,666
Smile and smile...
