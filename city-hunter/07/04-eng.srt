00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Piasu de kimetari, hade na mini o sagashitari

Biru no kabe ni boys, hora,

Shitai koto bakari aru nara,

Day by day, ii ja nai, all right

Kono mune no pazuru,

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,224
I don't have any money or work,
and I'm bored.

10
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,072
What the hell?

11
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,313
Wow, is this...

12
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,907
Oh, my, a pile of panties!

13
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,915
I've got them! These are all mine!

14
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,214
I'm so lucky!

15
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,827
Thief! Underwear thief!

16
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,354
He's stealing our merchandise!
Somebody, help us!

17
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,290
Oh, no, I just found these on the road.

18
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,509
Hey, don't run away from us!
You underwear thief!

19
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,144
Wait, you pervert!

20
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,012
No, I just found these on the road!

21
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,314
Wait!

22
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,385
Hey, you're being followed, aren't you?
Want a lift?

23
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,364
Wow, what a mokkori!

24
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,665
You getting in the car or not?

25
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,333
I am!

26
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,960
Ya-hoo!

27
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,171
Damn, we lost him.

28
00:02:55,475 --> 00:03:00,513
Anyway, that car with that joke
license plate, could it be...

29
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,175
The one who is called
"Helping People Escape?"

30
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,786
It's so soft and comfortable.

31
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,721
Hey, how long are you going to
stay in that position?!

32
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,816
With a Class A License For Love
Here She Is, a Beautiful Pro
at Helping People Escape

33
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,460
You saved me. Thank you so very much.

34
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,560
You're welcome.

35
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,093
Then...

36
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,473
Don't "huh" me. Money, you need
to pay me money.

37
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,975
Money?

38
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,012
Of course! I helped you escape from
the police without trouble, right?!

39
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,914
But I don't have any money,
not even a penny.

40
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,253
That's too bad.

41
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,745
Then there's no way for you to pay
except with your body, is there?

42
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,760
Use my body to pay you?

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,228
Exactly, pay me with your body.

44
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,229
I understand.

45
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,296
I guess I don't have a choice, do I?

46
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:04,377
Money is everything in this world,
but oddly enough, I have none.

47
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,779
My body was given to me by my parents,

48
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,582
so I'll hold back my tears and
use it hesitantly.

49
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,487
I'm going to pay you back with my body!

50
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,455
Wait a second!

51
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,622
I didn't mean like that! I want you
to help me with my business.

52
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,090
Watch out!

53
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,257
Missed her. Let's go!

54
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,774
Somebody is trying...

55
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,776
...to get you.

56
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,006
I'm so sorry.

57
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,285
I'm going to call us even
since you helped me.

58
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,749
What? Really?

59
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,755
However, you still owe me money for
holding me without any clothes on.

60
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,093
You're charging me for something like that?

61
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,969
Of course! My body is the foundation
of my business!

62
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,148
Do you have any idea why someone
is trying to kill you?

63
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,916
Far too many.

64
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:21,054
There are many people who'd want to
kill me because of my business.

65
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,221
Your business?

66
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,824
Oh, I haven't told you about it yet?

67
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,815
I am a professional at helping
people escape.

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,928
Helping people escape?

69
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,766
Oh! I think I've heard of a female
professional in that line of work.

70
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,836
But why is a beautiful woman like you
in a business like that?

71
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,139
Thank you. The riskier the business is,
the more money you can earn.

72
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,300
It's common sense, isn't it?

73
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,044
However, recently I've been in
some kind of trouble.

74
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,512
I think that someone is seriously
trying to kill me.

75
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,383
How about hiring me as your bodyguard?

76
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,713
You?

77
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,659
I have some reservations about that.

78
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,129
It's mainly the fact that you're
an underwear thief.

79
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,031
But I already told you I'm not
an underwear thief!

80
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,704
I've already made up my mind
to hire a professional

81
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,695
who's a little more reliable than you.

82
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,842
This place...

83
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:21,446
I guess you don't know, but there's
a secret to this bulletin board.

84
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,587
Here, you write it down like this... X, Y...

85
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,054
Z!

86
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:35,428
And you write the contact, then the
professional will see this and...

87
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,129
Roger. By the way,
what is your name?

88
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,563
Roger. By the way,
what is your name?
Here you go.

89
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,587
Roger. By the way,
what is your name?

90
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,260
You are...

91
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,205
You seem a little like a sex maniac,
but I guess that's okay.
Nice to meet you.
Miyuki Kobayashi

92
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,436
You seem a little like a sex maniac,
but I guess that's okay.
Nice to meet you.
Miyuki Kobayashi
MI... YU... KI...

93
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,139
Yo!

94
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,214
Ryo Saeba.

95
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,444
What? You got a job?!

96
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,992
Don't do anything without asking me!
It's my job to get you a job!

97
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,160
What's wrong with it?

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,651
We're in trouble since we haven't
had any work in a while.

99
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,664
How about this much for your pay?

100
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,170
Bodyguard fee for a day, 19,000 yen,

101
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,007
and when you protect me from ruffians,
I'll pay you 36,000 yen.

102
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:25,244
When you catch him, I'll pay you
102,900 yen, including tax of course.

103
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:29,315
No way! 19,000 yen per day?!

104
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,283
We need at least 30,000 yen per day!

105
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,517
That's too expensive! How about 20,000 yen?

106
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,615
No, no, at least 29,000 yen!

107
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,316
21,000 yen!

108
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,017
28,000 yen!

109
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,261
22,000 yen!

110
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,563
Incredible! She's haggling with Kaori!
27,500 yen!

111
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,831
Incredible! She's haggling with Kaori!
22,500 yen!

112
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,531
Incredible! She's haggling with Kaori!
27,000 yen!

113
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,054
27,000 yen!

114
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,368
23,000 yen! I can't go higher than that!

115
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,269
27,000 yen is the lowest I can accept.

116
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,742
I can't help it.

117
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,767
If you can't do it, I'm sure someone else will.


118
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,212
It's tough to make a living
without money, isn't it?

119
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,619
I'll take it.

120
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,713
Good, 23,000 yen is the final call.

121
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,192
Now, I'll pay you for today.

122
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,929
It's 11,500 yen for half a day, right?

123
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,265
That's right, I have to deduct a fee from it,

124
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,233
since he clung to me without
wearing anything.

125
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,705
That's not right! What about the payment
for when I helped you?!

126
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:30,165
I told you it'd be cancelled out since I helped
you escape as an underwear thief, right?

127
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:35,076
Underwear thief?!

128
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,084
Wait, Kaori! Don't misunderstand!

129
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,881
What she meant by underwear thief was...

130
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,849
You mokkori champion!

131
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,997
Look what I got!

132
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,461
No way, you octopus!

133
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,406
Well then, guard me well.

134
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,477
I'll let you be in my car, but you
ought to help my business.

135
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,279
What did you say?

136
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,282
If you don't like the idea, you can
follow me in your own car.

137
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,283
What will you do?

138
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,751
I'll help you! Yes, Ma'am.

139
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,255
Ryo, I'm leaving this one to you.

140
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,991
I don't think I can get along with this person.

141
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,395
Okay! Shall we go, Miyuki?

142
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,564
You touched me again.

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
1,000 yen will be deducted from
the bodyguard fee.

144
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,533
Oh, no!

145
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,635
I'll go with you.

146
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,798
If I leave you alone, the guard fee
will disappear.

147
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,208
Well, what do you need to do today?

148
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,145
Help a robber escape from a loan shark?

149
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,582
Robbery... Robbery from a loan shark?!

150

Bottakuri Salaryman Moneylender

151
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,022
Give me the money!

152
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,422
What the hell?!

That place is managed by yakuza and is
famous for its evil way of doing business.

155
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,234
Without knowing that, the old man
borrowed money from them,

156
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,104
and he was asked to pay an extreme
amount of money in interest.

157
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,008
Because of that, his small factory
was taken away from him,

158
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,010
and his family abandoned him.

159
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,706
He's now homeless and penniless.

160
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,678
It sounds like a typically tragic story.

161
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:25,625
Therefore, the money he paid me with
was that of a desperate old man.

162
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,593
I will help him escape, I swear it.

164
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,059
Hurry up, old man!

165
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,069
Damn!

166
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,339
We did it, old man!

167
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,140
It's too early to celebrate.

168
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,444
Damn! I won't let you escape!

169
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,155
What are you going to do now?!

170
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,281
Leave everything to me!

171
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,194
How persistent!

172
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,671
Miss Miyuki, watch out!

173
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,332
It's a red light!

174
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,766
I can't stop now!

175
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,685
We made it!

176
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,448
Now, it's time to fly!

177
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,873
Good job, Miss Miyuki.

178
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,255
Thank you, do you want some tea?

179
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,485
I won't charge for it, so don't worry.

180
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:11,664
Aside from the money, I can't go home
while you're alone here

181
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,233
since someone is targeting you.

182
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,201
Do you intend to spend the night here?

183
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,537
You don't need to worry about anything.

184
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,506
I'm a specialist at guarding someone
during the night. Trust me!

185
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,744
It was so close.

186
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,611
I won't allow you to spend any more money.

187
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,283
You, I can't take my eyes off of you
for even a moment.

188
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,220
Well, anyway, have some tea please.

189
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,687
Yes, Ma'am.

190
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,253
Watch out! Duck!

191
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,233
Miss Miyuki!

192
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,701
Miss Miyuki! Pull yourself together!

193
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,270
You're awake now, aren't you?

194
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,842
Mr. Saeba, you're touching me again.

195
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,469
Minus 1,000 yen.

196
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:03,182
So even if a woman like me touches you,
you still charge for it?

197
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,050
What? I lost my chance then.

198
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,855
Jeez, how can you think of money
at a time like this?

199
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,618
Someone is trying to kill you!

200
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,808
Are you sure you're going to work today
even though your life is in danger?

201
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,476
Of course.

202
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,809
How much money do you think
I'd lose if I took a day off?

203
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,774
Anyway, what are we going to do today?

204
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,746
Well, we're helping an inmate
break out of jail.

205
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:41,720
Break out...

206
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,687
...of jail?!

207
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,223
Wait, wait a sec.

208
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,626
This inmate isn't a violent murderer
or something like that, is he?

209
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,330
I don't know the details, but
I think he's innocent.

210
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,898
You THINK he's innocent?

211
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,836
The client is his younger sister,
and she told me so.

212
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,201
Miyuki!

213
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,441
What I'm going to ask you now
is very important.

214
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,577
The younger sister you've
just told me about...

215
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,744
Yes?

216
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,008
Is she beautiful?

217
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,919
Can't you think about anything else?!

218
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,922
Joke, it was just a joke!

219
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,321
Thinking about this case...

220
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,393
It might be anxiety,

221
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,796
but I think they started to attack me
after I took this client.

222
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,803
Chofu
Prison

223
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,353
Are you sure it will be okay
to let him escape?

224
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,626
You might receive an appreciation letter from
the Metropolitan Police Department,

225
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,961
but you won't be accused of doing this.

226
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,485
Really?

227
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,061
Get in! Hurry up!

228
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,707
There he is. Kill them all!

229
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,541
Roger.

230
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,342
Roger.

231
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,076
Roger.

232
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,777
Roger.

233
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:12,611
Roger.

234
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,703
Roger.

235
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,778
There they are.

236
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,086
Who the hell are they?

237
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,325
Well, they're probably assassins
hired by my former boss.

238
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,626
Former boss?

239
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,924
His name is Gouda, a member of the Diet.

240
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,665
His name is Gouda?

241
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,369
Wasn't his secretary arrested on bribery
charges several years ago?

242
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,538
That's me.

243
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,542
I took his guilt upon myself in exchange
for him taking care of my family

244
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,669
while I was away from home.

245
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,607
However, that promise was broken, wasn't it?

246
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,349
Worse than that.

247
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:54,581
My house was taken away to help
finance his election campaign.

248
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,616
How cruel...

249
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,557
I can't forgive him.

250
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,437
Idiots!

251
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,712
Cars two and three are out.

252
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,239
Currently, they are moving east
on Koshu Trail. Over.

253
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,749
Damn!

254
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,389
What the hell?!

255
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,527
Boss!

256
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,163
Their car has been duplicated!

257
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,358
You fool! Wake up!

258
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,294
It's true!

259
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,071
Separate into two groups;
don't let them get away.

260
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,436
Yes, Sir!

261
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,275
Smart ass...

262
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,144
When did Mr. Saeba prepare this?

263
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,584
Are you reevaluating us?

264
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,382
I guess, but you'll pay the
rental fee, won't you?

265
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,960
Why are you breaking out of jail?
Isn't there any other choice?

266
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,226
No, breaking out of jail is the
proof of my innocence.

267
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,493
By the way, about your younger sister...

268
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,370
Younger sister?

269
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,964
I don't have one.

270
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,807
Just as I thought.

271
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,343
Put your head down.

272
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,332
They're getting closer and closer to us!

273
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,665
Damn, they got a better car somehow.

274
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,671
Now, let me handle them.

275

00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,673
Miss Kaori, are you sure it's all right?

276
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,300
Trust me!

277
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,749
Out of bullets...

278
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,519
What the?

279
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,930
I am good!

280
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,344
Damn! Where are they?

281
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,011
What?!

282
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,428
Incredible!

283
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,036
Saeko, come on out.

284
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,936
Your brother is waiting for you.

285
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,631
Oh, you found me out, didn't you, Ryo?

286
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,380
No way!

287
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,116
Indeed, you're a true professional!

288
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,023
I'm good, aren't I?

289
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,927
In front of you!

290
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,392
Now you're done for.

291
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,736
Damn, this situation calls for
our final method!

292
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,104
Are you ready, Miss Kaori?

293
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,571
Yes, Miss Miyuki!

294
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,404
Let's go!

295
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,270
No way!

296
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,418
Hey, Miss Miyuki, let's get going! Hurry up!

297
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,027
I won't let you escape!

298
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,405
Here!

299
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,870
One, two...

300
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,912
Three!

301
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,654
I guess they thoroughly made fun of us.

302
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,494
I took out some of the powder,
so you should appreciate me.

303
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,430
The game is ended.

304
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,830
It looks like I didn't need to come help you.

305
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,056
Ryo!

306
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,700
Kaori, I have a higher opinion of you than
I had before. You did a good job.

307
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,443
It was because Miss Miyuki helped me.

308
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,413
That's not true.

309
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,040
You helped me a lot, Miss Kaori.

310
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,345
Miss Miyuki...

311
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,956
Thank you.

312
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:02,154
I guess it's thanks to your help that I'll be
able to catch the evil Diet member.

313
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,263
Saeko?

314
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,494
This lady is my client.

315
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,137
Once again, you used Ryo without
telling us, didn't you?

316
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,605
Oh, scary!

317
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:18,210
I didn't ask her to hire you.

318
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,643
I doubt it.

319
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,715
Let's see... Car rental fee, repair fee,

320
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,752
and the consolation money because
you hid the truth from me...

321
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,887
It's an additional three mokkori!

322
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,889
Right, Saeko?

323
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,186
Stare...

324
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,061
Can't you think about anything else?!

325
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,360
Joke, it was just a joke!

326
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:51,610
Mr. Saeba, Miss Kaori, how are you?

327
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,807
I'm currently driving in Africa.

328
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,774
I won the first rally I was in
after coming here.

329
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,521
I'm trying for a top ranking at
the next Paris-Dakar race,

330
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,388
just like I did in my previous race.

331
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,295
Miyuki will be participating in
the Paris-Dakar race!

332
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,332
That's why she was talking about
money all the time.

333
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,960
Oh, you touched me! That's 5,000 yen!

334
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:43,288
If you're feeling kazari bakari ki ni shite mo

335
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,192
Niji to hoshi ni wa kanawa nai

336
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,968
Kaze no tayori ga oshiete kureta

337
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,785
Taisetsu na egao, all of my love forever

338
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:14,214
Utsumuita kao o agete, sora o aogi

339
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:21,265
Kono te ni yasuragi o, starting over

340
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:29,770
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

341
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:35,846
Heart and heart, kono toki o

342
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:45,753
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

343
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:51,590
Heart and heart, kono toki o

344
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,800
Smile and smile...

345
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,077
Kaori, do you think there's an afterlife?

346
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,848
What? Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

347
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,216
I hate this subject, and anyway...

348
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,418
Do you think ghosts actually exist?

349
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,688
Cut it out! No way! Ghosts don't exist!
No way!

350
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,190
Do you really think so?

351
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,658
Stop!

352
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,216
Here comes a ghost!

The weirdest incident in the
history of City Hunter!

354
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,096
A client from another world!

355
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,164
Fear! A Shinjuku Ghost Story!
The Wandering Soul of a Beautiful Woman
A client from another world!

356
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,899
Fear! A Shinjuku Ghost Story!
The Wandering Soul of a Beautiful Woman
Stop!

00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,527
Fear! A Shinjuku Ghost Story!
The Wandering Soul of a Beautiful Woman
