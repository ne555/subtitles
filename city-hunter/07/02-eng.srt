Superintendent-General
Metropolitan Police

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:45,505
It's only a week until you leave for
Interpol HQ in Paris, Mr. Kuwata.

11
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,339
Yes, Sir.

12
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,477
Yes, to have Interpol ask
one of our detectives

13
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,814
to work directly with them is an honor.

14
00:01:54,814 --> 00:02:00,116
Well, I guess you'll enjoy your days in
Japan before leaving this week.

15
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,114
Actually, Superintendent-General...

16
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,893
Before I leave Japan, I would like to request
an arrest warrant for a man.

17
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:13,466
I see. I'm pretty impressed by
your zeal for your work.

18
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,900
Well then, who is the man?

19
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,338
The City Hunter.

20
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,173
The City Hunter?

21
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,542
He is a devilish, homicidal man, who
pretends to be a man of justice,

22
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,544
but actually makes a fool of
the police department.

23
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,071
It's a disgrace for the police department to
leave such a dangerous insect out there.

24
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,883
Please wait for the good news.

25
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,910
I promise I will arrest him within the week.

26
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:39,047
Farewell, Kaori!
Arrest Warrant for the City Hunter

27
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,331
Room Available for Rent
Men Only
Contact Makimura

28
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,001
Absolutely not!

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,370
Why? Why not?

30
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,706
I'm not interested in renting
a room to a man.

31
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,976
I don't care if it's a man or not,
we need some income!

32
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,512
After the Cessna destroyed this
apartment a little while back,

33
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,181
do you know how much we
spent on repairs?!

34
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,515
No means no!

35
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,385
Anyway, I've already decided to
rent the room,

36
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,852
so shut up and don't say anything.

37
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,314
Here he comes.

38
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,619
Just give it up, okay?

39
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,660
Why can't we rent the room
to a mokkori beauty?

40
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,261
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.

41
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,494
I called you the other day.
My name is Kuwata.

42
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,064
Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,477
What do you think? Do you
like it here, Mr. Kuwata?

44
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,848
Yes, I'm very lucky.

45
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:39,018
The room is nice and the
landlady is beautiful.

46
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,315
No way...

47
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,522
You seem pretty carefree though,

48
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,691
looking for a place to live carrying
just one suitcase.

49
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,919
Is that strange?

50
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,359
Maybe your wife or lover kicked you out?

51
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,829
Impossible! I'm a bachelor, and my motto
is to have few belongings.

52
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,100
Kaori, as I said, I'm against this idea.

53
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,408
Are you still saying things like that?

54
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,143
This room has just been taken.

55
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,412
Without checking with me first?!

56
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,249
Well, well, let's talk later.

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,342
See you later.

58
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,953
First of all, who the hell is he?

59
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,722
He looks good and seems nice.

60
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,349
You've gotten soft over a man like him?

61
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,660
Indeed, Mr. Kuwata has a sharp mind.

62
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,894
I wonder if Ryo will be okay or not?

63
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,037
Kaori's Room

64
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,700
Really, that Ryo! Complaining all the time,
even though he's a man!

65
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,242
A phone call in Ryo's room?

66
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,140
In a situation like this...

67
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,390
Hello, Saeba Company.

68
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,058
Oh, Saeko.

69
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,128
What kind of greeting was that?

70
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,430
Yes, Ma'am, how may I help you?

71
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,332
From Miss Saeko, just as I thought.

72
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:04,099
If she intends to force Ryo to work
for her, I won't let her do it.

73
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,739
You are such a happy-go-lucky
man as usual.

74
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,572
Do you know to whom you've
rented that room?

75
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,312
A detective, isn't he?

76
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,713
What? Detective?

77
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,782
Oh, you knew that.

78
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,979
Of course, it's obvious by
looking in his eyes.

79
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,950
His target is the City Hunter. You know
what this means, don't you?

80
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,694
I see. If I'm arrested,

81
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:31,464
you'll be in trouble because you've
given me information, won't you?

82
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,134
Oh, I'm not that clumsy!

83
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,304
I'm just showing you how much I care.

84
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,271
Later!

85
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,273
Mr. Kuwata wants to arrest Ryo?

86
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,179
What should I do?

87
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:56,856
I rented the room to a detective
who wants to arrest Ryo.

88
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,891
I'm such an idiot!

89
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,688
I have to do something about this.

90
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,303
Ryo, be careful.

91
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:45,502
Wait for me, City Hunter. I will
arrest you red-handed shortly.

92
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,380
Oh, you are so impatient, Kuwata.

93
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,314
Damn, is this a trap?!

94
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:02,555
Mr. Kuwata, Welcome to Shinjuku!

95
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,955
Ya-hoo!

96
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,025
What the hell?

97
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,734
I was planning to come and get you later.

98
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,335
What is this?

99
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,895
It's a welcome party for you!

100
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,642
The main guest is here, so let's start!

101
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,545
Anyway, you really have a good nose
for this stuff, Kuwata.

102
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,213
You would make a good detective,
wouldn't you?

103
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,916
Oh, is this gentleman a detective?


104
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,017
No, no, no.

105
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:35,647
So cute! He's exactly my type!

106
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,859
Isn't it nice to have a party at a gay bar?

107
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,161
This is the toughest bar in Shinjuku.

108
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,890
Oh, no...

109
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,061
Now, let's party all night!

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,729
Help me!

111
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,834
I feel sick!

112
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,245
Why did I do something like this?

113
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,770
Damn! It's all Saeba's fault!

114
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,586
Are you all right?

115
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,144
I'm fine.

116
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,157
Hey, Kuwata!

117
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,217
We'll have part two of the welcome party
at the same place tonight.

118
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,896
Excuse me, but...

119
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:17,697
I'm going to have fun again tonight!

120
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,965
Oh, no. I don't want to go back to that place.
I'm going to have fun again tonight!

121
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,956
Oh, no. I don't want to go back to that place.

122
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,109
Saeba is gone.

123
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,119
Before I get taken to part two...

124
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,625
Ah, Mr. Saeba, that's enough sake!

125
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,822
I'm not feeling well, so please excuse me
from the party tonight!

126
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,030
Excuse me...

127
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,498
Oh, it's you, Kaori.

128
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,497
May I help you?

129
00:08:55,635 --> 00:09:01,198
Well, why don't you go out to dinner with me,
since we live in the same building?

130
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:07,141
What a good idea! Let's go now,
before he finds us! Okay?!

131
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,422
I'm so happy because you asked me
out to dinner, Kaori.

132
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,157
No way...

133
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,597
I really want to convince Mr. Kuwata

134
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,327
to give up the idea of arresting Ryo.

135
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,970
But if I say something stupid, he might
find out that we're the City Hunter.

136
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,528
It might be a bad idea.

137
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,106
Excuse me, but I've heard that
you're a detective.

138
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,838
What a surprise! How did you know that?

139
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,149
I heard it from Saeko.

140
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,684
You mean Detective Nogami?

141
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,985
Yeah...

142
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,785
I didn't know that you knew
Detective Nogami.

143
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:55,261
Damn, I shouldn't have said
that I know Saeko.

144
00:09:55,261 --> 00:10:00,366
No, I said so, but I don't
know her that well.

145
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,904
Well, you want to catch the person
called City Hunter?

146
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,973
Do you know him?

147
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,574
No...

148
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,702
Not good, the more I talk, the more
I say things I shouldn't.

149
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,642
I've arrested many murderers in the past.

150
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,877
When I investigate them, they all
mention his name.

151
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,055
Murderers all say the same thing.

152
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:28,288
"I want to be number one, just like
City Hunter," they say.

153
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,820
City Hunter is the symbol of evil!

154
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,833
It's a lie!

155
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,369
City Hunter is the symbol of evil,

156
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,271
and that's why I'm going to arrest
him with my own hands.

157
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,439
It's not true! He's not that kind of person!

158
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,712
Oh, do you want to protect him?

159
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,840
Miss Kaori, you sound like
you know him well.

160
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,909
I'm such an idiot!

161
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,788
Or do you have something to do with him?

162
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,777
That's...

163
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,054
Don't say anything. I'm not
just playing around.

164
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,638
Come with us, our big brother
wants to see you.

165
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,745
Damn!

166
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,541
Stop!

167
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:30,956
Cut it out!

168
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:35,417
Shut up, or this woman's face
will be removed.

169
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,214
I finally meet you, City Hunter.

170
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,725
You fool! This guy isn't City Hunter!

171
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,104
You useless jerk!

172
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,676
You're Togawa, aren't you?

173
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,910
What?!

174
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,347
A most-wanted murderer who's wanted
for five cases of homicide.

175
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,450
Really, do you know me?

176
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,320
I've been chasing you for a year.

177
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,457
I appreciate you showing up
in front of me voluntarily.

178
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,360
Bro, this jerk is a cop. Kill him!

179
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,156
Wait!

180
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,768
You made a stupid mistake, but this
woman is the right one.

181
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,067
You're City Hunter's partner, aren't you?

182
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,334
What are you talking about? No, I'm not.

183
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,979
Don't make useless excuses.

184
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,382
My bro will be number one in
the underground world

185
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,018
after he kills City Hunter.

186
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:10,089
Actually, we're going to use you
as bait to lure him out.

187
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,191
Then what should I do about this guy?

188
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,261
I don't need him. Finish him.

189
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,228
Sure!

190
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,764
Stop!

191
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,531
Miss Kaori!

192
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,165
What the hell did you do to me?

193
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,544
Shut up! I don't know what you want,
but you need me, don't you?

194
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,513
If you kill Mr. Kuwata, I'll bite my
tongue off and kill myself!

195
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,105
Is that okay with you?

196
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,151
Bro...

197
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,013
Hold off for now.

198
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,955
I guess we kidnapped a troublesome woman.

199
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,293
Wrong person... They're such fools!

200
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:59,193
You didn't tell Kaori who he
really was, did you?

201
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,971
Kaori isn't a good liar, so it's better for her
not to know anything, isn't it?

202
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,881
I can't believe Kaori. Why'd she go
on a date with him?!

203
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,180
Well, if she knew she would be kidnapped,
she wouldn't have.

204
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:17,313
They killed three people during their escape.
They're very violent.

205
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,819
Here they are.

206
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:27,828
If you want to save your partner,
do exactly what I tell you.

207
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,971
Why did you help me?

208
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,740
I know you two are the City Hunter.

209
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,653
It would be better for you if I
died now, wouldn't it?

210
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,592
Answer me, Miss Kaori!
Why did you help me?

211
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,895
You're that murderer's partner, aren't you?

212
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,953
You're wrong!

213
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,437
What are you going to do?

214
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,705
We're going to escape from here.

215
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:11,074
It's too dangerous. Your gun was taken,
and there are three of them.

216
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,247
Ryo... I know Ryo will come to rescue us!

217
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,348
No way!

218
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:20,409
I'm a detective, and I refuse to accept help
from a murderer just like Togawa!

219
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,926
Ryo is not the kind of man
that you think he is!

220
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,928
But he's a murderer!

221
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,759
I said he isn't!

222
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,805
Togawa is going to use you as bait to lure
out City Hunter; then he'll kill him.

223
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,740
I won't let him do that.

224
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,275
I'm going to get out of this

225
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,210
and put the handcuffs on both
City Hunter and Togawa!

226
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:59,385
I don't understand why someone like you
is with a guy like Saeba.

227
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,867
Stop! No, stop, stop!

228
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,102
What the hell?
Stop! No, stop, stop!

229
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,770
Stop! No, stop, stop!

230
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,907
No way! Stop! Don't! No!

231
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,876
Hey, what are you doing to
our important hostage?!

232
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,911
Did you kill him?

233
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,318
No, I just knocked him unconscious.

234
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,419
That's enough.

235
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:46,905
If you had behaved, you could have
lived longer. Kill him.

236
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:47,701
Right!

237
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,177
Who the hell?!

238
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,221
Ryo!

239
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,188
Saeba!

240
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,457
City Hunter...

241
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,927
Welcome, City Hunter.

242
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,294
Well, if you want to save your
partner, come here.

243
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,936
However, there's no guarantee that
you can get out of here alive.

244
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,939
There are traps set, aren't there?

245
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:21,840
Traps?

246
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,467
You have sharp senses.

247
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,439
I hope I won't be seeing you in Hell later.

248
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,073
Are you done with your greetings?

249
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,513
Well then, now it's my turn.

250
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,592
That asshole! He shot the bombs!

251
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:50,969
Miss Kaori!

252
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,936
I'm fine!

253
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,414
No way! How did you know where
the bombs were?!

254
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:13,485
If you're going to use traps, you
should hide them better.

255
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,329
I understand.

256
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,457
I guess I can't be on the same level as you.

257
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,871
Please let me go. We're murderers,
the same kind.

258
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,498
We're colleagues, aren't we?

259
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,336
I see, colleagues...

260
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,610
Never say things like that. It makes me sick.


261
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,384
I'm neither an ally of yours

262
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,254
nor a tool of those police who think
themselves men of justice.

263
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,524
I live as I think is right.

264
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,991
Damn!

265
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,767
Don't move.

266
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,669
Next time, it'll be without mercy.

267
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,140
You wanted me to owe you something!
You didn't need to do that.

268
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,938
What? Why can't you say thank you
to me smoothly?

269
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,580
Watch out!

270
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,210
Mr. Kuwata!

271
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,819
Mr. Kuwata, are you all right?

272
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,634
Why? Why did you shoot?
Why did you kill him?!

273
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:33,505
You didn't need to do that! You're an
evil murderer just as I thought!

274
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,370
I didn't kill him.

275
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,942
The bullet barely grazed his temple,
and it caused a concussion.

276
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,973
You should handcuff him tightly to
avoid him getting violent again.

277
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,609
Well...

278
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,578
Mr. Kuwata...

279
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,751
Thank you.

280
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,222
I appreciate it. You protected Kaori.

281
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,627
Saeba...

282
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:07,972
Ryo!

283
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,002
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,574
I'm sorry...

285
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,889
Kaori, I'm sorry.

286
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:28,849
I've hidden from you and Saeko
that I'm the City Hunter.

287
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,098
Ryo?

288
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,667
I wanted to keep it a secret forever,

289
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,338
but now you've found out what I
really am, and I have no choice.

290
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,672
I've caused so much trouble for you,
who didn't know anything.

291
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,111
Goodbye, Kaori.

292
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,317
It can't be, Ryo.

293
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,666
Ryo...

294
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,735
Ryo...

295
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,564
Ryo!

296
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,038
Wait!

297
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,105
You don't need to make Miss Kaori cry.

298
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,019
Poison quells poison.

299
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,892
Police and the law are not the only
things that can be called justice.

300
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,394
Mr. Kuwata...

301
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,259
Take good care of Miss Kaori.

302
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,399
The reason I've come to think like this

303
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,425
is because I believe in Kaori's pure eyes.

304
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,807
Because she believes in you,

305
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,072
I now believe in you.

306
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,075
Mr. Kuwata...

307
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:03,714
One thing, if you use your power for evil,

308
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,682
I'll come back and arrest you.

309
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,487
Mr. Kuwata...


310
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,623
I leave those three to you.

311
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:30,210
Hey, Ryo, what you said was a lie, wasn't it?

312
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,050
Right?

313
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,211
Tell me you were acting!

314
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:43,219
If you're feeling kazari bakari ki ni shite mo

315
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:50,000
Niji to hoshi ni wa kanawa nai

316
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:57,598
Kaze no tayori ga oshiete kureta

317
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:07,281
Taisetsu na egao, all of my love forever

318
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,615
Utsumuita kao o agete, sora o aogi

319
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:20,561
Kono te ni yasuragi o, starting over

320
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:29,032
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

321
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:35,075
Heart and heart, kono toki o

322
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:44,716
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

323
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,484
Heart and heart, kono toki o

324
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,867
Smile and smile...


325
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,673
I'll ask someone to erase
my memories of you.

326
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,610
Then I won't need to feel so sad.

327
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,013
Yuki...

328
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,350
Miss Yuki!

329
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,889
Kaori, hurry!

330
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:22,053
Idiot, you can't win against me
without a weapon.

331
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:30,462
The Beautiful Woman Who Buys Danger!
