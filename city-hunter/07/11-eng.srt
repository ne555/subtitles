1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Deciding on pierced earrings or
looking for a flashy mini-skirt

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Boys along the building wall, look,
they're waiting to ambush you

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Turn your heart into a game

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
If you have many things you want to do,
start the one you can

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
You can take it day by day, it's okay,
wherever you start from

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
If you can hold me tight,
I can treasure your smile

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
You can take it day by day, all right,
I've already realized

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
What the first piece to the
puzzle in my heart is

9
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,401
Is Lieutenant Nogami here?

10
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,471
How may I help you? The report
is already done.

11
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,739
Can you come by my office later?

12
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,001
Yes, Sir.

13
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,540
Interpol has requested that we assist
with an investigation of theirs.

14
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,584
The boss of the Hong Kong Mafia,
Lin Hu Shen,

15
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,449
has escaped and supposedly
has come to Japan.

16
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,117
Long time no see, Saeko.

17
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,461
Asakura!

18
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,537
It's been six years.

19
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,440
I didn't expect to be your partner again.

20
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,775
I'm sorry I'm not as young as I used to be.

21
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,845
I think I've recently gained a mother complex,
so I don't care about that.

22
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,073
You're so mean.

23
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,607
Saeko!

24
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,234
They were quick, weren't they?

25
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,342
It's like the God of Plague has
come back to you, isn't it?

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,975
A Trigger Covered with Scratches!
The Detective Saeko Loved

27
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,825
You can't fool me!

28
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,095
There's always a story behind
Saeko's requests!

29
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:20,600
Well, yeah, but she's not asking
to stay here for free.

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,635
Besides, she has a guest with her.

31
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,304
I don't think it's really a
big deal, is it, Kaori?

32
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,073
No means no. Ryo, I know that
you want mokkori,

33
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,909
but I won't allow you to just do
whatever you want!

34
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,679
That's what my manager said.

35
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,116
I can't do anything about it. I guess
I don't behave myself very often.

36
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,954
What should I do now? This time,
I have a budget to spend.

37
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,981
There's lots of money involved, and
this is an official request.

38
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,591
I'm so disappointed.

39
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:53,157
Wait, wait a second. Is it true that
this is an official request?

40
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,237
Yes, of course. We just want you to
let us stay for a couple of days.

41
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,003
Our most expensive room is available.

42
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,567
Thank you! Then I'm going to show
him there. See you later!

43
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,279
This is all poverty's fault!

44
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,323
I hope Saeko didn't force you to do this.

45
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,348
Oh, not at all.

46
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,962
By the way, did you eat lunch yet?

47
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,486
No, not yet.

48
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,230
Then, I'll put some food for you in the
living room. Make yourself at home.

49
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,145
One, two, three, four...

50
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,847
What are you doing?
Two, two, three.

51
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,181
Warming up.

52
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:42,682
For what?
Warming up.

53
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,349
For what?
Two, two.

54
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,284
Two, two.

55
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,986
You're asking me? You know
the answer don't you?

56
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,422
You claim you want to stay here,
but it's an excuse, isn't it?

57
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,889
I know what you're thinking.

58
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,619
Hey, just a second, Ryo!

59
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,968
Do you like your room?

60
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,203
Excuse me for having bothered you.

61
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,433
Oh, nothing's happening!

62
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,636
You've got it all wrong!

63
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,746
I'm not boorish enough to interrupt
someone's love affair.

64
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,617
Oh, that was such an impressive line!

65
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,952
My mokkori has been interrupted for so long!

66
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,522
Finally, I've met someone
who understands me!

67
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,854
Thank you, thank you! I'm so happy!

68
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,694
Well, please continue what you were doing.

69
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,259
I, Ryo Saeba, will obey what you have said.

70
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,275
Saeko!

71
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,242
Hi!

72
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,224
Please don't misunderstand me.
He's usually like that with everyone.

73
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,593
You looked like you were having fun.

74
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,790
No way! I want nothing to do with him.

75
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:09,330
Never mind. Anyway, is it confirmed
that Lin Ho Shen is in Japan?

76
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,664
His brother has a trading business
in Yokohama.

77
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,379
You've gotten married, haven't you?

78
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,981
Damn, I forgot to remove it.

79
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,584
Were you going to seduce me while
pretending to be single?

80
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,585
Exactly.

81
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,820
You big liar, I know that you had
no such intentions.

82
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,378
I'm not so sure about that.

83
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,559
Let me say something. I absolutely refuse
to be dumped by you twice.

84
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,201
Chinatown

85
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:03,120
Hong Kong
Trading Company

86
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,990
Please wait here.

87
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,226
Asakura...

88
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,490
From this point on, this is my responsibility.


89
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,736
Show me your member ID.

90
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,481
Is that woman with you?

91
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,615
No.

92
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,617
I can't let you in here since you're alone.

93
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,584
What?

94
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,690
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Hurry up and open the door.

95
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,482
Allow me to take this.

96
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,131
What in the hell is going on here?

97
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:28,606
You're very welcome, Detective
Asakura of Interpol.

98
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,540
Please come this way.

99
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,213
I didn't order anything.

100
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,182
It's on us.

101
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,050
Where is Ho Shen?

102
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,020
I haven't seen my older brother
in two or three years.

103
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,622
What was that?

104
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,758
Even though I've been trying to contact
him, I've been unable to

105
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,727
since he doesn't stay in the same
place for even a week.

106
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,264
I'm going to ask you the same
question one more time.

107
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,732
Where is your older brother?

108
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,825
I have no idea.

109
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,201
Asakura!

110
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,344
Let's go, Saeko.

111
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,323
You looked like a totally different
person back there.

112
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,497
Six years have passed; people change.

113
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,728
Please tell me. Is there a story behind this?


114
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,141
I'm going to work by myself
starting tomorrow.

115
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,558
Lin Ho Shen...

116
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:10,736
He was suspected of murdering Chan Lee
and Yumiko Asakura and arrested.

117
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,139
The next day, he was released
due to a lack of evidence.

118
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,952
Asakura...

119
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,331
You're very skilled.

120
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,709
Same to you.

121
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,986
I would like to hire you, City Hunter.

122
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,189
Unfortunately, my business policy is
not to accept requests from men.

123
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,159
Besides, with you being such a good shot,

124
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,094
I'd say your enemy already has
one foot in the grave.

125
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,630
Only if he's in front of me.

126
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,865
I am a walking dead man.

127
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,637
What do you mean?

128
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,176
It means that a man who can't make
the person they love happy

129
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,701
has no right to live.

130
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,348
If I can't find my target...

131
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,484
That's what I meant, City Hunter.

132
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,424
Really, these guests are so rude!

133
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,002
Did you invite them?

134
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,371
I didn't send any invitations.

135
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,540
I'll send you my bill later.

136
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,237
It's fine by me, but before that, you
might receive an arrest warrant.

137
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,553
This is the power of a 3D sound system!


138
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:51,270
Go! Yes! There, get them!

139
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,397
Fire! Fire, fire, fire, fire!

140
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,337
Get them!

141
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,276
Damn!

142
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,555
They're so showy!

143
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,263
How much do you think
it will cost to repair?!

144
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,457
Damn!

145
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,894
Damn!

146
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,173
This game of hide-and-seek is over.

147
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,952
Sorry, but I don't have time
to play with you guys.

148
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,640
Damn!

149
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:10,782
What's wrong?!

150
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,846
Sorry, could you...

151
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,487
...put a pill into my mouth?

152
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,836
Please don't tell anybody about this.

153
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,377
I don't have much time left.

154
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,949
Are you going to fight against
them by yourself?

155
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,990
Unfortunately, I'm an optimist.

156
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,958
Someone will cry because of it.

157
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,594
She'll forget about me someday.

158
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,494
Besides, you'll be by her side.

159
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,371
Female friendship, I kind of envy that.

160
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,846
Goodnight.

161
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,909
Kaori, Kaori!

162
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,400
Do you know where Asakura went?

163
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,947
Kaori?

164
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,281
Grudge

165
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,519
Grudge
Never mind, I'll look for him by myself.
See you.

166
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,543
Grudge

167
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,386
You damn devil! Die, die, die, die, die!

168
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,395
I understand why.

169
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,297
Chinatown

170
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,199
I've found him! This way!

171
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,281
Listen! Don't let him get away alive!

172
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,270
Yes, Sir!

173
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,125
Why is this happening at a time like this?!

174
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,290
Ryo!

175
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,193
Do you know where Asakura went?

176
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:28,812
Police Department Hospital

177
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,615
He looked as if he were sleeping.

178
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:07,642
I guess he was relieved since he's been
released from his physical pain.

179
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,621
What do you mean?

180
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,089
He was seeking a place to die.

181
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,455
Let's go, Saeko.

182
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,995
To where?

183
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,155
Work.

184
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,366
I'm going to ask him to pay
his bill from Heaven.

185
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,798
I see.

186
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,745
Stop fooling around! Hurry up!

187
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,657
Our guest will arrive here no later
than eleven o'clock.

188
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,526
I know that, brother.

189
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,687
Hurry up! Hurry up!

190
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:10,849
It wasn't a bad idea to smuggle heroin
by mixing it with liquor.

191
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,051
Who the hell are you?

192
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,287
I came to deliver the bill.

193
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,515
Bill?

194
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,881
For your lives.

195
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,458
Just by yourself?

196
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:24,996
Kill him!

197
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,477
No way...

198
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,693
Damn!

199
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,833
Damn!

200
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,341
Damn it!

201
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,764
This is the end.

202
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,407
If I were to kill you so quickly,
I'd be going too easy on you.

203
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,228
The men whom I've loved seem fated to die.


204
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,164
I don't know about that.

205
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,291
I don't intend to die soon.

206
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,697
You flatter yourself too much.

207
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,704
It's a bad habit of mine.

208
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,343
Ryo, can you do me a favor?

209
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,310
What is it?

210
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,012
I guess I forgot to bring my handkerchief.

211
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,178
Can you give me a shoulder to cry on?

212
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,414
My pleasure!

213
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:43,222
If you're feeling, even though you
tend to your accessories

214
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:50,126
You can't compete against the
rainbows and stars

215
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:57,901
Tidings from the wind taught me

216
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:07,718
Your smile is important,
all of my love forever

217
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:14,147
Raise your downcast face
and look up at the sky

218
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:21,198
Give me peace in my hands, starting over

219
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:29,703
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

220
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:35,779
Heart and heart, at this very moment

221
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:45,686
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

222
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:51,523
Heart and heart, at this very moment

223
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,733
Smile and smile...

224
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,732
Well, all right. I hope you're
careful not to get burned.

225
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,277
Wait!

226
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,241
I understand.

227
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,248
You mean that you want me, don't you?

228
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,621
Her breasts are very dangerous.

229
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,958
All right! I did it! I did it!

230
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,518
I kissed Rika on her lips!

231
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,463
It'd be my pleasure.
