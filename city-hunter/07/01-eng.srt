1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Deciding on pierced earrings or
looking for a flashy mini-skirt

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Boys along the building wall, look,
they're waiting to ambush you

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Turn your heart into a game

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
If you have many things you want to do,
start the one you can

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
You can take it day by day, it's okay,
wherever you start from

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
If you can hold me tight,
I can treasure your smile

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
You can take it day by day, all right,
I've already realized

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
What the first piece to the
puzzle in my heart is

9
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,494
Ah, what nice weather!

10
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,963
It's the peak of spring right now, isn't it?

11
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,231
It really is.

12
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,936
Spring is the season of love.
Let's go out and seek new love!

13
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,072
Rather than seeking new love, why don't
you go seek new work?

14
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,075
Damn, when you say something to me,
it's always the same thing.

15
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,911
When the time comes, the work
will come to me.

16
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,914
So you've been saying, and how many
weeks have passed now?

17
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,584
How many months, you should say.

18
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,211
Damn, there you go again.

19
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,124
I don't care what it is, but I wish some
work would fall from the sky.

20
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,092
What a joke!

21
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,565
Ryo, that Cessna...

22
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,123
Yeah, something is definitely wrong!

23
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,966
It isn't coming this way, is it?

24
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,532
It's coming straight for us!

25
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,303
Kaori!

26
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,510
Big Revival of the Funny Pair
The Beauty Fallen from the Sky

27
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,974
We're alive, aren't we?

28
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,532
I think so.

29
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,879
Anyway, you said that you
didn't care what it was.

30
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,315
You just wished some work
would fall from the sky.

31
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,375
Hey, don't blame this on me!

32
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,254
Jeez!

33
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:12,350
Why is there a building here?!

34
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,064
A female pilot?

35
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:28,874
Ryo?

36
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,802
Hi, I'm a doctor.

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,015
The shape of your bust has not
been destroyed, I gather.

38
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,087
Well, well, take off your clothes,
and lie down here please.

39
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,990
We don't know what part of your body
you might have injured.

40
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,225
Excuse me...

41
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,826
Ryo!

42
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:50,557
I can't believe you're joking around
while our place is like this!

43
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,962
Oh, I am so, so...

44
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,672
Sorry!

45
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,278
The plane suddenly went out of control,
and I tried my best, but...

46
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,143
I'm really sorry.

47
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,950
Well, nobody got hurt, and
that's a good thing.

48
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,850
By the way, what's your name?

49
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,256
My name is Shoko Amano.

50
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,850
Shoko, what a nice name.

51
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,662
My name is Ryo Saeba.
This must be our fate.

52
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,028
Why don't you have some tea with me?

53
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,202
Excuse me, but the lady behind you...

54
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,912
My name is Kaori Makimura,

55
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,642
and my job is to protect women
from this jerk's mokkori.

56
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,651
What?!

57
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,586
When did you start a job like that, Kaori?

58
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,323
No questions accepted. Eat this!
100 ton hammer!

59
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,760
Disgusting!

60
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,235
I guess I crashed into an amazing place.

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,730
Air Freight Logistics - Transportation
Kodama Air

62
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,739
It wasn't my fault!

63
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,819
It's so obvious that the accident
was caused by sabotage.

64
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,153
Why am I the only one being punished?
I don't understand!

65
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,661
When an accident occurs, the pilot is
punished. It's a matter of course.

66
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,595
But the cause was...

67
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,031
I can't believe that you crashed the
plane into an apartment.

68
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,592
Fortunately, those people were unharmed,
but think about it!

69
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,039
Anyway, until the investigation of this
accident is over, you are not allowed to fly.

70
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,336
Am I clear?!

71
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,423
I can't fly.

72
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,618
Not being able to fly...

73
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,328
I guess you really love to fly through
the sky, don't you?

74
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,722
Of course! Flying is everything to me.

75
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,831
I guess you can't understand how I feel.

76
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,343
By the way, you said that the plane suddenly
went out of control while you were flying?

77
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,447
It was probably engine failure.
Maintenance didn't do their job.

78
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,506
Just thinking about it makes me mad!

79
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,018
Forget all that bad stuff and...

80
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,990
Come with me...

81
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,220
And have dinner! How about it?!

82
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,162
Mr. Saeba!

83
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,129
Yes?

84
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,966
I'm so frustrated!

85
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,535
Let's party and have fun!

86
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,868
Oh, yeah! That's right! Let's party,
just the two of us!

87
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,003
Three of us.

88
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,674
She's here!

89
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,374
Am I a ghost or something?

90
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,318
I'm so stuffed!

91
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,513
The best feeling in the world!

92
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,357
The last piece of chicken...

93
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,328
Be careful, the last bite will make you a pig.

94
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,195
Not a pig, but I can be a bird.

95
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,493
Wings will suddenly grow on your back.

96
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,299
I wish they would.

97
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,630
Miss Shoko, you really love flying,
don't you?

98
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,917
Thank you for everything. I haven't felt
this good in a long time.

99
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,092
By the way, that was an F-15 Eagle.

100
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,295
I sleep really well when I hear that sound.

101
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,456
Well, goodnight. Bye!

102
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,057
Goodnight.

103
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,933
Her sense is something else, isn't it?

104
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,740
Ryo?

105
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,469
WHOOOOOOOOOSH!!

106
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,103
Hopeless!

107
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:18,164
Falcon, you shouldn't laugh at him
that much! Right?

108
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,866
Right!

109
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,701
You can escape from a bullet,

110
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,538
but you couldn't escape from
a Cessna, could you?

111
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,974
Shut up! Stop laughing right now,

112
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,670
or I'm going to make you into pickled
octopus and feed you to the cats!

113
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,869
By the way, Ryo, where are both of you
going to sleep tonight?

114
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,251
The Cessna destroyed your apartment,

115
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,921
and only your bedroom is
undamaged, isn't it?

116
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,013
No!

117
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,668
He's right. This is the only room we can use.

118
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,863
Only one bed...

119
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,806
I don't want to sleep in the same bed as you!

120
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,008
Excuse me!

121
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,533
Don't think you're the only one
who doesn't like the idea.

122
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,744
Damn, that Umibozu jerk. He could've
let us stay there.

123
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,379
I am not that senseless.

124
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,382
I won't forgive you if you approach me.

125
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,831
What a cold-minded woman you are.

126
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,934
This bed was originally mine, wasn't it?

127
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,061
Are you saying that I should catch cold?

128
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:35,099
Well, I won't do anything, so please
let me under the covers, please!

129
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,639
Do you promise that you won't do anything?

130
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,702
Have I ever approached you before?

131
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,986
Am I that unattractive to you?

132
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,588
What?!

133
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,157
Hey, do you want me to do
something to you?

134
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,784
No way!

135
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,095
Fine, if you want to get in, get in.

136
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,655
Why are you mad at me?!

137
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,117
What's the matter?

138
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,719
You came on my side, didn't you?

139
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,753
No I didn't.

140
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,550
Liar! I heard the bed squeak.

141
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,702
This floor is old, and on top of that,

142
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,866
the heavy shock and our combined
weight made the floor fall.

143
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,750
Hey, hey, don't get so close to me!

144
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,184
I can't help it! Jeez!

145
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,489
If I fall asleep in a situation like this,

146
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,252
I don't know what he'd do to me.

147
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,195
I wish I were with Shoko.

148
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,200
You're the only person I won't mokkori.

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,668
Ryo's going to go straight to sleep!

150
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,906
Shut your mouth! Hurry up and go to sleep!

151
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,845
Why are you so mad?

152
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,715
Idiot!

153
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,115
He really is an idiot!

154
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,500
First of all, it's all Ryo's fault.

155
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,570
You get mokkori immediately
when you see a woman.

156
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,373
Right? You're just like that.

157
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,342
Even though you say you wouldn't
mokkori me, I am a woman.

158
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:55,036
It's natural for me to feel
endangered, isn't it?

159
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,241
If possible, I don't want to use
my hammer, but...

160
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,587
Ryo?

161
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,353
Ryo...

162
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,223
It's a little too late to visit someone's
house, isn't it, Mister?

163
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,227
Damn!

164
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:55,863
Well, well, since we have a huge hole
like this, a thief snuck in.

165
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,307
His target was the Cessna?

166
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,485
Oh, my, are those drugs?

167
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,248
Well, probably.

168
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,819
I guess this was not a simple accident.

169
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,721
You let them find out about the drugs!

170
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,864
You idiot!

171
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,957
I'm so sorry, boss.

172
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,036
In this situation, they'll have to die!

173
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,105
I can't leave this to someone like you!

174
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:26,901
Well...

175
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,477
You have a troublesome man as your enemy.

176
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,842
Who are you?

177
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,483
You're the one I've heard about,
the professional saboteur.

178
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,444
I am Koumori.

179
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,626
Drugs were found in my Cessna?!

180
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,730
Recently, a new type of LSD has
been spreading quickly

181
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,925
throughout the central Kantou
region, and this is it.

182
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,969
Why was something like that in the Cessna?

183
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:02,100
Think of it as someone using a Cessna
aircraft to operate a drug running business.

184
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,667
It can't be. Someone in the
company is doing that?

185
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,017
Then Miss Shoko has been transporting
drugs without knowing it?

186
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,009
No, if so, this is too small a portion.

187
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:21,126
I checked the Cessna, and I found
sugar in the fuel tank.

188
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,096
And there was a cut in the vertical
rudder control wire.

189
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,831
What did you say?!

190
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:31,269
Which means they tried to kill you
and blame everything on you.

191
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:36,408
Officials would find the drugs and your dead
body in the wreckage of the crashed Cessna.

192
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:41,311
The officials would think that you had an
accident in the middle of a drug run.

193
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,045
Dead people tell no tales.

194
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,848
Oh, no, I was almost killed.

195
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,928
Don't worry. I will protect you.

196
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,832
You, who are you?

197
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,939
Leave things to us.

198
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,141
We are professionals at this sort of thing.

199
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,009
Professionals?

200
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,271
Right, Ryo?

201
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,178
Yes!

202
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,513
She was so shocked, wasn't she?

203
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,220
Hello, Amano residence?

204
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,396
What? Really?

205
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,738
Oh, sorry. I was a little too mean
to you yesterday.

206
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,697
Yes, we can't turn these clients down,
so please help me.

207
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,180
You can fly this afternoon?

208
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,015
What about your punishment?

209
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,086
They have some urgent job to do,
I guess. How lucky I am!

210
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,783
Jeez, she totally forgot that someone
is trying to kill her.

211
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,333
Hi, good morning, Miss Shoko.

212
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,467
Good morning.

213
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,137
Without you, our work will be delayed,
and I'll be in a jam.

214
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,339
You flatter me!

215
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,807
Well, come with me.

216
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,774
Yes!

217
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,177
What's that?!

218
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:26,144
Oh, man! This is the legendary adult video
that I was never able to get!

219
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,013
Wow!

220
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,351
I've really wanted to watch this!

221
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,096
No way! That many?!
Am I dreaming or what?!

222
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,963
Wow, I hope this isn't a dream!

223
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,302
I really wanted to pilot this one.

224
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,738
The load is pretty big, so I chose this one.

225
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,673
Wow, how nice!

226
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,540
What? Ryo?
Wow, how nice!

227
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,208
What? Ryo?
I can't believe this!

228
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:49,936
I can't believe this!

229
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,812
Jeez! This happens every time
I take my eyes off of him!

230
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,610
I'm so happy.

231
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,887
Wow!

232
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,481
It's a pile of underwear!

233
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,820
Yahoo!

234
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,719
I'm so moved!

235
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,993
What?

236
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,310
Where did you go, Ryo?

237
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,813
What are you going to do
to guard Miss Shoko?!

238
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,839
Are you sure the death will
look like an accident?

239
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,688
Don't worry. I'm a professional.

240
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,384
Once she takes off, she won't
be able to land.

241
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,929
When she tries to land and
lowers the front tires,

242
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,330
the plastic bomb will explode.

243
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,499
Nothing will remain.

244
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,871
This is terrible!

245
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,401
Dumb!

246
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,742
Well, stand up.

247
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,251
Jeez, I wonder what happened to
Mr. Saeba and Miss Kaori?

248
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,195
Miss Shoko, it's time. Take off.

249
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,253
Yes!

250
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,631
I trust you, Mr. Saeba.

251
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,675
Such an easy job.

252
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,751
Neither of you put up much resistance.

253
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,379
Ryo? What did you do to him?!

254
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,016
Him?

255
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,793
I guess he's in...

256
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,782
I'm right here.

257
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,801
Ryo!

258
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,826
You?! How?!

259
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,065
Do you really think you locked me
in there using things like that?

260
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,465
First of all...

261
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,078
I can't satisfy myself with just software.

262
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,539
Damn!

263
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,323
Are you all right?

264
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,791
Miss Shoko is in danger!

265
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,985
What?

266
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,096
A bomb?!

267
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:29,701
Yes, the bomb was set in the front tires.

268
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,033
It will explode when you lower
the landing gear.

269
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,667
What did you say?!

270
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,710
Listen, do exactly what I say.

271
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,014
Oh, no! In that case, I can't land the plane.

272
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,017
What were you doing?! You're my
bodyguard, aren't you?!

273
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,746
Calm down, Miss Shoko!

274
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,590
Trust me! I promise I'll get you
back on the ground.

275
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,524
Do exactly what I say.

276
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,955
I understand. I believe you.

277
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,998
Tell me what to do.

278
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,330
Good girl, come back here immediately.

279
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,242
Ryo, here she comes.

280
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,140
All right.

281
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,286
Get ready to land without
lowering the wheels.

282
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,522
Fly really close to the runway.
Can you do that?

283
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,489
I'll try.

284
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,096
Mr. Saeba, just what...

285
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,360
Stay like that. Concentrate on
manipulating the plane.

286
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,059
I believe you, Mr. Saeba.

287
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,166
Kaori, change drivers!

288
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,561
So suddenly?!

289
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,382
Why me?!

290
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,225
Idiot, be careful!

291
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,283
Sorry, sorry.

292
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,153
That wire!

293
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,863
Idiot, he isn't looking at anything but
the plane, so he can't see me.

294
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,601
Die, Saeba!

295
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,712
What the hell?!

296
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,407
Ryo, look out in front! Front, front!

297
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,380
The runway will end soon!

298
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,852
Keep driving like this, Kaori!

299
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,027
Mr. Saeba, don't overdo it!

300
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,291
Believe in me and keep flying, Shoko!

301
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,223
It's okay now. You can land, Shoko.

302
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,383
Mr. Saeba...

303
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,291
Mr. Saeba, you're such a...

304
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,371
You're trying to be cool, but do you
know where you are?

305
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,439
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

306
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:43,389
If you're feeling, even though you
tend to your accessories

307
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:50,293
You can't compete against the
rainbows and stars

308
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:58,068
Tidings from the wind taught me

309
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,885
Your smile is important,
all of my love forever

310
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:14,314
Raise your downcast face
and look up at the sky

311
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:21,365
Give me peace in my hands, starting over

312
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:29,870
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

313
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:35,946
Heart and heart, at this very moment

314
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:45,853
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

315
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:51,690
Heart and heart, at this very moment

316
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,900
Smile and smile...

317
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:01,839
Ryo!

318
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,437
Goodbye, Kaori.

319
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,441
No way, Ryo.

320
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,555
Ryo...

321
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,690
Ryo...

322
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,192
Ryo!

323
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:30,668
Farewell, Kaori!
