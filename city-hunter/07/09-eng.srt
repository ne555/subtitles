1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Deciding on pierced earrings or
looking for a flashy mini-skirt

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Boys along the building wall, look,
they're waiting to ambush you

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Turn your heart into a game

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
If you have many things you want to do,
start the one you can

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
You can take it day by day, it's okay,
wherever you start from

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
If you can hold me tight,
I can treasure your smile

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
You can take it day by day, all right,
I've already realized

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
What the first piece to the
puzzle in my heart is

9
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:35,054
Ryo, I don't know what to do.

10
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,964
Is it true that you killed Ms. Sonia's father?

11
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:43,294
Is it true that you hurt Umibozu's eyes?

12
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,939
I don't want you to duel because of that!

13
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,440
Ophthalmologist
I don't want you to duel because of that!

14
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,929
Ophthalmologist

15
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,976
Absolutely not!

16
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,410
Ryo, is there no other way?

17
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,175
I can't do anything for you as your partner.

18
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,986
It's your birthday today, but...

19
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:04,946
The Place Where Gun Smoke Goes
City Hunter Dies at Dawn!

20
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,801
Will you take me with you, Mr. Saeba?

21
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,307
It's strange.

22
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,180
The man who will fight Umibozu for his life,

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,149
and you, the one who loves him to the
death, are driving there together.

24
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,930
Is this the place?

25
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,593
Umibozu or me... One of these graves
is for one of us.

26
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,038
Please tell me, Makimura.

27
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,300
All of my partners have died from being shot,
every last one of them.

28
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,606
Am I haunted by the God of Death?

29
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,651
Or might this be my turn.

30
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,196
Miki!

31
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,289
Why are you here?

32
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,162
I came to see the conclusion of this, Falcon.

33
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,363
Miki...

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,741
Saeba!

35
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,472
It seems that one of the players is missing.
Where is Kaori?

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,547
Don't worry. She's over there.

37
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,552
Ryo!

38
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,322
Stop this foolish duel!

39
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:46,691
It's your birthday today, isn't it?!

40
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,554
Well, shall we start, Umibozu?

41
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,269
It's just like you to have chosen a
graveyard for a duel, isn't it?

42
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,706
I guess. It'll save time carrying the body
of whichever one of us dies.

43
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,107
The rules of this duel are simple.

44
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,715
Five minutes from now, I'll honk
the horn of my car.

45
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,342
That's the signal to start.

46
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,412
After that, you keep on fighting until
one of you dies. Understood?

47
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,114
Ryo...

48
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,181
Here, Kaori, are you all right?

49
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,750
Don't do anything without my permission!

50
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,586
Saeba has come to duel as promised!

51
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,421
Kaori is free to leave now!

52
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,446
Ms. Sonia, you...

53
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:57,530
Ryo!

54
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,326
Kaori!
Ryo!

55
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,825
Don't move.

56
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,271
If you were killed getting involved
in this, I'd be in trouble.

57
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,141
You still have value to me.

58
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:13,704
If Saeba survives, I'll make him feel
the same pain I've been suffering.

59
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,147
Ms. Sonia...

60
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,355
Enough is enough!

61
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,414
You don't understand anything
of how Saeba feels!

62
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,961
Do you have any idea how he felt
when he shot his own partner?!

63
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,985
Shut up!

64
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,533
Listen to me!

65
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,503
Saeba killed Kenny in a duel.

66
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,997
And Kenny was the one who
challenged him to the duel!

67
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,646
Don't tell me such lies!

68
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,079
It's not a lie.

69
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,122
Where are you aiming? I can't help you
if you get cursed for doing this!

70
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,496
You can't say that about me.

71
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,442
My papa challenged Saeba to a duel.

72
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,217
Saeba told me not to tell anybody, but...

73
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:30,178
Saeba had to kill Kenny to save your life.

74
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,383
My life?

75
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,764
Damn!

76
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,860
We broke so many tombstones doing this.
What will I do if I get cursed?

77
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,532
If someone deserves to be cursed
it's that octopus.

78
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,267
He broke more of them than I did.

79
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,972
Oh, it's not a four-leaf clover.

80
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,774
The Goddess of Luck might've disowned me.


81
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,745
What do you mean, Kenny?

82
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,147
It's simple, young man.

83
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:32,982
Today, people call me the number one
bounty hunter in America.

84
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,988
However, I'm not young anymore.

85
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,690
If I don't do something about it,

86
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,359
you might take my position from me
since you're so young.

87
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,259
I just couldn't take that.

88
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,366
I won't lose to a young man like you.

89
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,336
This duel is where I'll bet my
professional pride.

90
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,973
But I'm your partner.

91
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,477
No matter what world it is, only one
person can ever be number one.

92
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,808
Prepare yourself, Ryo!

93
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,446
No!

94
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,349
Think about Sonia.

95
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,419
If she loses you, what would happen to her?

96
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,785
You're the only relative she has!

97
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,592
What you just said proves that you
badly underestimate me.

98
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,329
Do you think you can win
against me, young man?

99
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,890
I'm going to destroy your conceit!

100
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:24,937
Ryo!

101
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,404
Kenny!

102
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,856
Kenny...

103
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,268
Kenny!

104
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,346
Kenny!

105
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,711
Good job, Ryo.

106
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,753
Kenny, I...

107
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,256
All right... It's all right.

108
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:21,193
For Sonia as well...

109
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,995
Sonia?

110
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:33,496
A syndicate forced me to kill you
or Sonia would be...

111
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,810
The syndicate is too large.

112
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,913
I couldn't run away from them
along with my daughter.

113
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,108
You intended to die from the beginning?

114
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,786
Now Sonia will be all right.

115
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,084
That's foolish! There's no way!

116
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,048
I have one favor to ask of you.

117
00:09:52,658 --> 00:10:00,064
Please let her enjoy an ordinary life,
one outside of the underground.

118
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,790
I understand.

119
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:08,800
Please tell her that I died in an accident.

120
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,279
I'm the worst father.

121
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,647
What are you talking about?!

122
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,084
You're the best father for Sonia!
The best in the world!

123
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,611
No, I'm just a miserable man.

124
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:27,892
It's true that I didn't want to pass my
position as number one on to you.

125
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,462
I'm a very small-minded man.

126
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:41,374
A man like me shouldn't have lived
so close to his daughter.

127
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:47,938
I can't protect her except by
dying for my loved one.

128
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,943
Sonia!

129
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,688
Kenny!

130
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,862
It can't be...

131
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:14,235
It's a big lie! It has to be a giant lie
created by Saeba!

132
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,137
Why can't you understand?

133
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,442
He's been suffering for you. All that
he's done was to protect you!

134
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,413
You know that he's not the kind of man
who would lie, don't you?

135
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,780
Why can't you trust Saeba?!

136
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,588
Believe him, Sonia.

137
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,554
That time...

138
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,636
Believe Ryo? Why are you saying
this so suddenly, Papa?

139
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:48,274
Regardless, no matter what happens,
believe Ryo, Sonia.

140
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,545
No matter what happens. No matter what
happens to me, believe him.

141
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,749
As long as you believe him,
you will live a happy life.

142
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,114
Understand, Sonia?

143
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,921
Papa, why are you saying this
with such a serious face?

144
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,048
It should be obvious.

145
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,193
I like Ryo.

146
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,161
Next to you, he's been the
kindest to me, Papa.

147
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,096
So I'll always believe Ryo.

148
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,565
Good, that's good.

149
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,106
It can't be.

150
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,095
Papa...

151
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,976
Sonia!

152
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:36,955
Miki!

153
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,221
Ms. Sonia!

154
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,435
Papa and Ryo dueled for me.

155
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,235
And this time, Falcon and Ryo are
in a duel because of me!

156
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,939
Sonia! Why did you come here?

157
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,206
Falcon, the duel is cancelled.

158
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,222
I understand the reason why
Ryo shot my papa.

159
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,592
I'm withdrawing my request, so it's over.

160
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,595
Please end the duel, please.

161
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,324
Don't say such selfish things.

162
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,928
We can't cancel it now.

163
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:22,701
Let me go!

164
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,102
No!
Let me go!

165
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:23,602
No!
I can make it. I have to stop them.

166
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,604
I can make it. I have to stop them.

167
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,593
No!

168
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,042
We can't stop them from doing this.

169
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,412
Why? They're killing each other!

170
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,902
Why can't we?

171
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:42,288
You can forget about owing my papa.
It was my misunderstanding.

172
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,789
Falcon!

173
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:47,156
Your request was only the beginning of this.

174
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,889
This is now a serious battle
between Ryo and me.

175
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,232
Why?

176
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:57,692
You two are best friends, aren't you?
Then why?

177
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:02,004
My self-confidence, it's the pride of a man.

178
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,337
If I had to put it in words.

179
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,912
Or maybe it's my blood that makes me do so.

180
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,952
I've fought my entire life and it's the
only thing that makes me boil.

181
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,620
It's in my blood.

182
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,147
This might be the fate of a man who has
been covered in gun smoke.

183
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,626
Saeba is probably the same as I am.

184
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,967
And this is also my only chance
to fight against him.

185
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,703
Because of the old wound to my eyes

186
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,694
I will be blind soon.

187
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,704
Go, or you might be hit by a stray bullet.


188
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,071
No!

189
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,585
I don't want everybody to be sad!

190
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,577
Even if I need to shoot your arm,
I will stop you!

191
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,489
Ryo!

192
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,896
No! Stop!

193
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,830
Sonia!

194
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,956
Please!

195
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,259
Forgive me, Sonia.

196
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,807
He's going blind?

197
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,877
I went to the clinic and confirmed it.

198
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,813
That's why this is Falcon's last chance.

199
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,149
Last chance...


200
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,619
But they're killing each other.
One of them will die!!

201
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,989
I know that! But I also understand
what he's feeling.

202
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,957
I can't do anything about it.

203
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,888
Miki...

204
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,909
Miki, you...

205
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,554
Damn! I can't believe I slipped
when he fired at me.

206
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,893
No, not now.

207
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,636
In this situation...

208
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,104
It's strange, there's no sign of him.

209
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,810
Could he be trying to draw out this battle?

210
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,754
What's going on?

211
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,813
It's as if nobody is there.

212
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,592
There's no sign of them.

213
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,153
The menacing atmosphere over
this place has gone away.

214
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,661
Impossible, both of them couldn't have...

215
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,997
Ryo!

216
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,472
Ryo!

217
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,628
Ryo!

218
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,686
Kaori!

219
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,900
Ryo, where are you?

220
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,636
Kaori! Don't! Don't come over here!

221
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,399
I've got you, Ryo!

222
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,944
Octopus, where are you? I'm right here!

223
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:26,911
Ryo!

224
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,076
Umibozu, I'm right here!

225
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,288
You're finished.

226
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,429
Stop!

227
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:04,983
Ryo...

228
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,682
Ryo!

229
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,147
It can't be...

230
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,695
Don't come over here! It's not over yet!

231
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,662
Ryo...

232
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,101
The tombstone saved me.

233
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,796
The bullet only grazed my head.

234
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,647
My brother's grave?

235
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,850
Ryo, stop!

236
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,503
I guess we lucked out. This battle is a draw.

237
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,848
No, I lost.

238
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:14,410
When Sonia tried to shoot me,
you could have fired.

239
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:19,683
No, if your timing weren't off,
I would have died.

240
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,024
Miki!

241
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,803
Barely alive, I guess.

242
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,172
But my eyes are useless now. There's no
reason for me to live anymore.

243
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:45,274
I know you want to stop being
my partner, don't you?

244
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,547
When I said, "barely alive," I meant me!

245
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,993
If you had died, I would've died too!


246
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,295
Miki...

247
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,059
We're partners, sharing one mind
and one body!

248
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,498
Even if something happens,
we'll never be separated.

249
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,539
If you can't see, I'll be your cane.

250
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,702
So please don't hide anything
from me ever again.

251
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,168
We'll be together when we die, Falcon!

252
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,409
Miki, you...

253
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,051
Miki...

254
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,324
Ms. Sonia...

255
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,705
I was an idiot for ignoring my papa's will

256
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,274
that said to stay away from the underground.

257
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,468
Goodbye.

258
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,434
Wait a minute, Ms. Sonia.

259
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:51,550
Both Ryo and Falcon, you have such
good partners and are happy.

260
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,452
Me?

261
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,321
I'm a drag on him.

262
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,881
I couldn't do anything except
scream a little while ago.

263
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,993
What are you talking about?

264
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,429
Because of your screaming, Ryo was saved.

265
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,735
Falcon's timing was thrown off for
an instant because of you.

266
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,532
I did that?

267
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,733
Goodbye, Ryo.

268
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,079
Ryo, is it okay to let her go?

269
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,685
It's all right.

270
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,950
She'll live in a different world from now on.

271
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:53,072
If you're feeling, even though you
tend to your accessories

272
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:59,976
You can't compete against the
rainbows and stars

273
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,751
Tidings from the wind taught me

274
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:17,568
Your smile is important,
all of my love forever

275
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:23,997
Raise your downcast face
and look up at the sky

276
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:31,048
Give me peace in my hands, starting over

277
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:39,553
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

278
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,629
Heart and heart, at this very moment

279
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:55,536
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

280
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:01,373
Heart and heart, at this very moment

281
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,583
Smile and smile...

282
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,656
Sorry, Ryo. It's your birthday, but...

283
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,893
This can't be called a present, but...

284
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:25,164
Kaori, I'll treasure this lucky charm.

285
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,998
Your birthday is also coming soon.
What do you want for your present?

286
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:40,343
Ryo, I want you to be alive to
spend my birthday with me.

287
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,589
And also next year, and the year after that.

288
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,324
That's what I want.


289
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,884
I'm going to buy you a real
birthday present tomorrow.

290
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,793
No, I'd like to have the same thing as you.

291
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,208
Lovers?

292
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,609
We'll be lovers just for tonight.

293
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,439
Ryo's not really holding me.

294
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:16,247
Not like that. When you kiss someone,
you should close your eyes.

295
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,356
This can't be!

296
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,381
Ryo and I kissing?

297
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,621
But... but...

298
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,097
My Love For Tonight Only
Cinderella Story in the City
But!

299
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:30,796
My Love For Tonight Only
Cinderella Story in the City
