1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Deciding on pierced earrings or
looking for a flashy mini-skirt

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Boys along the building wall, look,
they're waiting to ambush you

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Turn your heart into a game

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
If you have many things you want to do,
start the one you can

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
You can take it day by day, it's okay,
wherever you start from

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
If you can hold me tight,
I can treasure your smile

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
You can take it day by day, all right,
I've already realized

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
What the first piece to the
puzzle in my heart is

9
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,010
Damn, where did he go? All right,
separate into two groups.

10
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,180
Requiem for the Repose of Souls
A Young Noble from a Far Away Country

11
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,661
Brother, I'm back again.

12
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,329
Excuse me...

13
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,152
I'm so hungry!

14
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,990
Kaori, when can I eat?

15
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,799
Ryo, you're back.

16
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,893
We have a guest here, Mr. Hans Zeigfried.

17
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,445
Kaori...

18
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:41,051
Congratulations, Kaori!
Your love has finally bloomed!

19
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,390
Congratulations on the coming
of your blue-eyed lover!

20
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,530
This is the happiest moment of my life
as your adopted brother.

21
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,158
Well, good luck!

22
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,601
What the?

23
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,602
That boy, he's an orphan.

24
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,716
His late father was Austrian and
his late mother was Japanese.

25
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,585
So he wanted to see the place of his
mother's birth at least once.

26
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,712
He came to Japan from Austria.

27
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:20,393
He came to a foreign land by himself.
I'm impressed by his courage.

28
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,229
Oh, how wonderful! Really incredible!
Impressive!

29
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,965
Nobody else would possibly be able to do it!

30
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,425
Then, you've fallen in love,
Kaori, haven't you?

31
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:37,003
Western or traditional Japanese?
Which way do you want it, Kaori?

32
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,344
Hiding Her Humiliation

33
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,337
Do it alone.

34
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,578
Really, that Kaori is so shy.

35
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,852
Here you go, Hans.

36
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,328
Please eat as much as you want.

37
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,795
Yes, thank you.

38
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,526
It's good!

39
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,700
I'm impressed. You're still young,
but you're already diplomatic.

40
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,839
Did you say something?

41
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,773
What? Oh, no. Nothing.

42
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,037
Hey, Hans.

43
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,281
Why don't you cancel the hotel
reservation and stay here?

44
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,484
It'll be expensive if you stay at the hotel.
Right? Can he, Ryo?

45
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,421
Sure, I have no problem with it if
that's what you want, Kaori.

46
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,123
Oh, don't misunderstand me!

47
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,058
Thank you, Ms. Kaori, and Mr. Saeba.

48
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,465
I'm really glad that I came to Japan.

49
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,905
I've already met people who've
been kind to me.

50
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,841
In Europe,

51
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,935
there's a professional killer called the
Young Noble from Hell, right?

52
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,503
Who did you come to kill?

53
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,483
Who knows? It might be you.

54
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,716
Goodnight.

55
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,502
This is the tallest building in Tokyo.

56
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,469
Well, let's go.

57
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:30,048
Was Tokyo like this when
my mother was alive?

58
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,093
I don't think so. I'm sure that it's
changed a great deal.

59
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:39,632
This town is changing itself
each day little by little.

60
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,793
It doesn't ever show the same face.

61
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:46,237
It's so different from the town where I live.

62
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,869
Hey, Hans, can I ask you a question?

63
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,245
What were you burying at the
graveyard yesterday?

64
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,242
It was my mother's hair.

65
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,449
I wanted to return her to her hometown,
even if it was just that.

66
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,383
You're sweet, aren't you?

67
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,227
Why are you watching us?

68
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,239
Do you have anything to do with my guest?

69
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,935
Go! The next time I see you around us,
you're a dead man.

70
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,540
You'll pay for this!

71
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:34,509
Hans, Hans? What's the matter, Hans?

72
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,418
Hey, pull yourself together!

73
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,082
Hans!

74
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,556
Hey, wait up!

75
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,600
Are you sure you're okay?

76
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,761
Yes, I'm fine.

77
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,372
I'm probably just tired from the long trip.

78
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,307
Hans, what did you do when
you were in Europe?

79
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,913
I guess you were able to dispose of a
certain killer a little while ago.

80
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,750
I killed the boss of that organization.

81
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:16,492
I've been training since I was little to
use a gun and to kill, Mr. Saeba.

82
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,491
I didn't have any freedom at all.

83
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,035
Even though I wanted to go to the country
where my mother was born,

84
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,196
the organization didn't listen.

85
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,198
That's why you killed your boss.

86
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,901
I didn't intend to kill him, but you could
say circumstances forced me.

87
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,339
I didn't have any other choice.
I don't have much time left.

88
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,845
I have a fatal disease.

89
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,581
The doctor told me that I only have
three more months to live.

90
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,326
Ms. Kaori!

91
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,797
Ms. Kaori!

92
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,478
Hans! Hans! Hans!

93
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,793
Hans is a professional. Did you know that?

94
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,868
When I met him for the first time, I knew it.

95
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,269
I'm disappointed in myself.
I didn't realize it at all.

96
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,274
How many years have I been your partner?

97
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,798
I should be dismissed.

98
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,110
You don't sound like yourself, Kaori.
Why are you depressed?

99
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,956
Is it Hans? I don't think his fate
is to die soon.

100
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,157
But...

101
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,559
He might be able to make it yet.

102
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,357
Now, don't you have anything
you can do for him?

103
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,188
I see.

104
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,531
You're right.

105
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,700
Mama... Mama!

106
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,037
Hans...

107
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,979
Hans, I know you'll recover.

108
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:21,853
I just know it.

109
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,761
Hospital?

110
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,531
Yes, you're going to the hospital and
getting a proper diagnosis.

111
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,066
I'm sure you'll be able to recover.

112
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,935
I don't need to.

113
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,095
Hans!

114
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,139
I understand.

115
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,243
I'll go to the hospital, but on one condition.

116
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,642
Condition?

117
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,542
Mr. Saeba, please compete with me.

118
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,954
Six bullets each to the center of the target.

119
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:59,825
If you miss even one, you lose.
If I lose, I'll go to the hospital.

120
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,793
If I lose?

121
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,529
Ms. Kaori and I are going on a date
for the entire day.

122
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,301
Will you do it, Ms. Kaori?

123
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,003
Then, I'll go first.

124
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,143
Indeed!

125
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:44,870
Incredible.

126
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,318
If you were in a real battle,
you would've died.

127
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,320
I lost.

128
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,123
Well, I'll give you the day off.

129
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,114
Go out on your date with Kaori!

130
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,795
Mr. Saeba?

131
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,796
Ryo?

132
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,366
Well, both of you, have fun.

133
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:18,029
It's wonderful to be young. The sky is blue.

134
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,546
Well, Asakusa, Ueno...

135
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,849
You like the old part of town, don't you?


136
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:34,479
Yes, I want to see the Tokyo
where my mother lived.

137
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:41,260
Hey, how do you think we look to others?
Sister and brother or lovers?

138
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261
Mother and son?

139
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,132
What? Mother and son? You mean
I'm your mother?

140
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,760
Oh, no, do I look that old?

141
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,281
Hans, can you tell me about your mother?

142
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,483
I don't remember much about her.

143
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,186
She died when I was very little.

144
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,454
I see...

145
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:13,357
But if she were alive now, I'm sure she
wouldn't accept me like this.

146
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,264
I know I won't be able to see her
in Heaven, but if I could,

147
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,733
I'd like to say sorry to her.

148
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,293
Hans, you'll recover.

149
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,500
You'll definitely recover.

150
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,775
So, when you do, let's live together.

151
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,275
Ms. Kaori...

152
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,647
I'm sure Ryo would agree with me.

153
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,112
Thank you, Ms. Kaori.

154
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,084
Thank you, Ms. Kaori.

155
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,432
Hans!

156
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,275
Kaori!

157
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,140
Hans!

158
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,706
Damn!

159
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,857
Hans, get in the car!

160
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,663
They're following us, just as I planned.

161
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,736
Who the hell are you?!

162
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,930
Shut up!

163
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,835
Why didn't you shoot?

164
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,969
I'll rescue Ms. Kaori, even if I have to
give up my life in exchange.

165
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,680
Masterpiece
Movie Theater

166
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,993
This is a trap.

167
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,393
But we can't go back.

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,800
Give this to Ms. Kaori.

169
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,642
This is...

170
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,373
I'm really glad I came to Japan.

171
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,207
I have nothing left to regret now.

172
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:22,943
I'll keep this for now, but you ought to
give it to her yourself.

173
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,456
If I survive.

174
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,844
Welcome, both of you.

175
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,880
Ryo! Hans!

176
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,184
You've underestimated me, coming here
knowing it was a trap.

177
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,119
However, that will prove to be a fatal mistake.

178
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,112
If you hurt Ms. Kaori, I'll kill you.

179
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,028
Which of us will die, you or me?

180
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,066
If you want to save this woman, both of you,
fight to the death right now!

181
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,033
What?

182
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:16,040
Well, I want you to start now,
or else I'll pull the trigger.

183
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,346
Mr. Saeba...

184
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,464
No! Stop it, both of you!

185
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,726
Don't get so upset!

186
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,361
How many years have you been my partner?!

187
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:51,065
Yes, that's right. Everything will be
all right, won't it, Ryo?

188
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,414
Hans, I know that you'll understand this.

189
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,439
Aim for my heart.

190
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,214
I know that. This gun never betrays me.

191
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,589
There's only one way to save Ms. Kaori.

192
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,550
Ryo!

193
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,161
Good job, Hans. Indeed, you really are
the Young Noble from Hell!

194
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,167
You promised me. Let Ms. Kaori go.

195
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,431
Sure, I'll do it.

196
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,496
But before that, toss your gun away.

197
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,034
Go.

198
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,737
Ms. Kaori, hurry up and come here.

199
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,440
Ryo! Ryo!

200
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,085
Ms. Kaori!

201
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,109
Don't move!

202
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,460
What?!

203
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,070
Ryo!

204
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,308
You cheated me!

205
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,866
Yes, we did.

206
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,568
Hans!

207
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,692
This is the end.

208
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,052
Hans!

209
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,456
Hans!

210
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,625
Hans!

211
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:09,107
Ms. Kaori, I'm glad that you're all right.

212
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,369
Hans!

213
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:20,752
If your bullet was off target,
it would've penetrated this.

214
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,151
Nothing less from you.

215
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,523
I'm a professional.

216
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,187
Hans!

217
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:35,434
Just as you told me, Mr. Saeba,
this was the fatal one.

218
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,494
Ryo, hurry up and take Hans to the hospital!

219
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,440
It's all right, Ms. Kaori.

220
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,375
I'd rather stay like this.

221
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,545
Ms. Kaori...

222
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,144
My mother...

223
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:58,116
My mother allowed me to meet you.

224
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,227
I'm really glad I came to Japan.

225
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,218
Really...

226
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,961
Hans! Hans!

227
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,064
Hans!

228
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,359
Hans told me to give this to you, Kaori.

229
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,970
Hans...

230
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,905
died in the warmth of his mother.

231
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,709
Hans...

232
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:43,122
If you're feeling, even though you
tend to your accessories

233
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,026
You can't compete against the
rainbows and stars

234
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,801
Tidings from the wind taught me

235
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:07,618
Your smile is important,
all of my love forever

236
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:14,047
Raise your downcast face
and look up at the sky

237
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:21,098
Give me peace in my hands, starting over

238
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:29,603
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

239
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:35,679
Heart and heart, at this very moment

240
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:45,586
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

241
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,423
Heart and heart, at this very moment

242
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,633
Smile and smile...
