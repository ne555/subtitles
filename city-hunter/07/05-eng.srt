1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Deciding on pierced earrings or
looking for a flashy mini-skirt

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Boys along the building wall, look,
they're waiting to ambush you

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Turn your heart into a game

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
If you have many things you want to do,
start the one you can

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
You can take it day by day, it's okay,
wherever you start from

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
If you can hold me tight,
I can treasure your smile

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
You can take it day by day, all right,
I've already realized

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
What the first piece to the
puzzle in my heart is

9
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:04,045
Fear! Shinjuku Ghost Story!
The Wandering Soul of a Beautiful Woman

10
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,932
XYZ...

11
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,991
It's probably just a rumor, but...

12
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,097
What are you...

13
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,606
That was close. I'm glad I could make it.

14
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,915
Excuse me, but what the hell are you...

15
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,473
It's done.

16
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,512
Put your head down.

17
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,791
It's clear. Let's go!

18
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,758
Okay!

19
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,460
Now!

20
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,891
WXY?

21
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,870
New competition?

22
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,036
You're the City Hun...

23
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,946
You're too loud.

24
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,282
This business belongs in the
underground world!

25
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,918
Even so, why did you hide
from someone like that?

26
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,920
Because I have so many enemies.

27
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,688
Anyway, you're in luck.

28
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,784
If I wasn't there, you wouldn't have seen me.

29
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,134
You're handsomer than I expected.


30
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,897
You're my type.

31
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,007
Your broad chest is wonderful.

32
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,346
Good, you pass.

33
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,014
Pass?

34
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,349
I've heard the rumor.

35
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,409
Your favorite form of payment isn't money.
It's mokkori, isn't it?

36
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,522
I'd refuse to pay if you were a geek,

37
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,286
but for a gorgeous man like you, it's okay.

38
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,088
It's my pleasure to pass.

39
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,300
Lucky me! I'm glad I got there
before Kaori did.

40
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,971
The problem is my younger sister.
I wonder what she would say?

41
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,272
Younger sister?

42
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,108
Now, I'm going to start telling you
what I want.

43
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:06,545
You know that there's been a series of
murders recently, don't you?

44
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,882
I want you to catch the murderer.

45
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,942
Was someone you know killed by him?

46
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,887
Actually...

47
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,856
I'm the one he killed.

48
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:24,189
I know that it's hard to believe,
but it's true. He killed me.

49
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,170
That's too much for a joke.

50
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,906
Are you saying that you're a
ghost or something?

51
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,909
I can touch you like this, and...

52
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,571
You have attractive legs.

53
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,548
You won't get paid until you perform
my request, will you?

54
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,947
Yes, Ma'am.

55
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,220
It's up to you whether to believe me or not.

56
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,656
But you have to hurry, or he'll kill
my younger sister too.

57
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,295
I thought it was too good to be true.

58
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,560
Well, it's not uncommon to see someone
go insane in this weather.

59
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,342
What's the matter?

60
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,536
Are you all right?

61
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,345
Oh, no, she isn't breathing right.

62
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,320
She needs help. Of course, I can help
her by doing mouth to mouth.

63
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,796
Where am I?

64
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,499
Why am I wearing clothes like these?

65
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,468
Excuse me...

66
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,096
Why did you do that all of a sudden?!

67
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,774
Pervert!

68
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,934
What's wrong?

69
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,604
What the hell is going on?

70
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,651
Did the ghost forget this?

71
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,952
DOB: 10/18/1970
Ami Asaka

72
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,045
DOB: 10/18/1970
Ami Asaka
Ami Asaka...

73
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,124
Well, what'll I do now?

74
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,992
I can't forget about her.

75
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,983
What can't you forget about?

76
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,766
You, you met the client without
telling me again, didn't you?

77
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,599
Well, actually...

78
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,071
The client's a ghost?!

79
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,181
Well, she told me as much.

80
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,284
I'm not good at dealing with things like that.

81
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,753
Then why not go home?

82
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,987
Hey, Ryo.

83
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:28,988
Manager's Office

84
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,819
Manager's Office
Miss Ami Asaka?

85
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,660
Her room is 401.

86
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,426
Well then, that person is
actually living here.

87
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,400
But...

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,958
She died.

89
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,503
She was murdered by a serial killer.

90
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,710
She was a beautiful lady.

91
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,583
Hey, Ryo, let's go home.

92
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,819
Let's go before she possesses us.

93
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,310
Before the ghost appears, let's
hurry up and go home.

94
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,852
It might be a little too late.

95
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,710
There she is!

96
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,258
Even if a ghost possesses me,
mokkori is a mokkori!

97
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,317
You, you are...

98
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,662
Ami!

99
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,698
Evil Dispersion

100
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,298
You can go to Hell, you mokkori jerk
with no fear of God!

101
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,599
Why are you making so much noise?

102
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,737
She's the twin sister of Miss Ami.
Her name is Mami.

103
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,378
A twin sister?

104
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,888
Then, the client you met was not Miss Ami,

105
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,491
but her younger sister, Miss Mami,
wasn't she?

106
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,359
Of course, there's no way a
ghost can exist, right?

107
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,693
Client? What are you talking about?

108
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,097
I met you a short while ago at
the cafeteria, didn't I?

109
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,240
You don't remember, do you?

110
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,299
I don't understand what you're
talking about. I...

111
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,013
What's the matter, Mami?

112
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,380
This is the same condition that
Ami had a little while ago.

113
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,912
Yes, I'm the one that you met. I'm Ami.

114
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,818
I was able to meet you by borrowing
my sister's body like this.

115
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,332
Now, Mr. Saeba, didn't you understand
that I am already dead?

116
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,498
Yes, Ma'am...

117
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,440
I was killed because

118
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,308
I accidentally witnessed one of the
serial killer's murders.

119
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,648
At first, I thought I could run away from him.

120
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,479
But...

121
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,801
Sister!

122
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,336
I'm sorry I was late.

123
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:40,801
Sister?

124
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,918
Sister! Sister! Wake up, Ami!

125
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,378
Sister! Ami! Wake up!

126
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,598
I guess the murderer is confused
as to whether you

127
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,465
or your sister is the witness, isn't he?

128
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,131
I know he intends to kill my sister
just as he killed me.

129
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,468
Please, Mr. Saeba, protect my sister!

130
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,508
Understood, Ami.

131
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:19,051
I appreciate that you stayed for your
sister's sake, not for revenge.

132
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,109
Ryo!

133
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,656
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

134
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,257
I will pay you more than enough in reward.

135
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,425
Wow!

136
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,451
With that weight lifted from my shoulders,
I'm somehow feeling tired.

137
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,532
I usually borrow my sister's body
while she's asleep.

138
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,693
It's time for me to go now.

139
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,124
See you.

140
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,600
Oh, where am I?

141
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,813
Oh, boy!

142
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,982
What a quick change!

143
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,949
Really...

144
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,997
Well, I'm Ryo Saeba.

145
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,761
I'm your sister Ami's fiancé.

146
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,170
Hey, wait, Ryo.

147
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,840
And this is my younger sister, Kaori.

148
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,545
Fiancé? My sister didn't say
anything about it to me.

149
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,213
I guess she intended to tell you about me

150
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,317
after I returned from Singapore,
where I was working.

151
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,284
But...

152
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,790
I see. I didn't realize that. I'm sorry.

153
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,259
Oh, don't be, Mami.

154
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,625
What happened to your sister must've
been quite a shock to you.

155
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,199
And you might think it impudent of us,

156
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,004
but until you can settle down, we
would like to take care of you.

157
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,207
Oh, no, you don't need to do
that much for me.

158
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,475
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

159
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,645
You've become like a little sister to me.

160
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,169
It's no trouble at all.

161
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,152
Then, I'll accept your offer.

162
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,322
To be honest, I've been feeling
uneasy about being alone.

163
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,952
Recently, I've been feeling strange,
as if someone was watching me.

164
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,887
Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't brought you any tea.

165
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,269
Ami, aggressive just as I like,

166
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,931
but Mami, who is graceful, is also my type.

167
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,807
Why did you do that, Kaori?!


168
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,297
Shut up and come this way.

169
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,579
Do you really intend to accept
this strange job?

170
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,581
What part of it do you think is strange?

171
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,778
It's too strange. The client is a ghost!

172
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,553
During this season, it's very appropriate,
don't you think?

173
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,721
Ryo!

174
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,925
Then, you stay here by yourself.
I'm going home this time.

175
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,450
All right, whatever.

176
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,833
If I go home now, it will be just
the way Ryo likes it, but...

177
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,496
I'm so scared of ghosts!

178
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,707
What's the matter? Why are you here?

179
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,505
Well, Kaori told me she wants to go home.

180
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,246
Oh, are you going home?

181
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,181
Oh, well, yes.

182
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,017
Since you made up your mind, why don't
you hurry up and go home?

183
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,852
Damn!

184
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,820
Go for it! Go home!

185
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,584
I'm going to stay here too!

186
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,654
Please...

187
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,400
Don't hesitate.

188
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,631
If you're here, the ghost will run away.

189
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:29,175
Well, so much happened today that
I guess you're tired, right?

190
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,544
Let's drink and sleep peacefully tonight.

191
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,414
Don't fill it up like that. I can't drink much.

192
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,711
Oh, don't hesitate.

193
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,286
I know what Ryo's really thinking.

194
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,122
He's going to put Miss Mami to sleep
by getting her drunk

195
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,647
and then wait for Miss Ami
to possess her sister.

196
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,194
However, I won't let that happen!

197
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,895
The only person who's falling
asleep is you, Ryo.

198
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,830
A sleeping pill will take care of him
until tomorrow morning.

199
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,534
Kaori, I won't let you disturb
my mokkori business.

200
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,162
I'll put you into a deep sleep
until tomorrow morning.

201
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,542
I don't know why, but it's very
tense in here with those two.

202
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,748
Kaori, aren't you tired?

203
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,774
I'm just giving her a shoulder massage.

204
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,387
It's obvious that he's plotting something.

205
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,083
Oh, not as much as you, brother.

206
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,595
Oh, a female streaking outside
of the window!

207
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,263
What? Where?!

208
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,629
What are you talking about?
This is the fourth floor!

209
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,435
Joking! I was just joking!

210
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,672
Ah! There's a huge cockroach that
looks like a rat over there!

211
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,130
What?! There's no way there could be
a cockroach like that!

212
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,878
Joking! I was just joking!

213
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,041
Anyway, cheers!

214
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,452
I can't believe there are people
who can't drink.

215
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,900
They're a strange pair of siblings,

216
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,336
but while I'm with them, I somehow
feel at ease.

217
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,240
Goodnight.

218
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,546
Ami...

219
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,208
No, no way!

220
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,896
That's a sad sound.

221
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,237
Mr. Saeba...

222
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,040
I'm surprised. You're very good.

223
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,775
Do you want to be a pianist?

224
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,302
This piano... My sister bought it for me.

225
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:52,017
My parents died four years ago
in a traffic accident,

226
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,387
and it was then that I gave up
becoming a musician.

227
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,557
But my sister started to work,

228
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,293
so I was able to go to college
to study music.

229
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,126
I know that she had her own dream.

230
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,467
My sister used to say that her dream

231
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,493
was for me to become a famous pianist.

232
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,274
She would say that I'd win
the Chopin Competition

233
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,110
and earn lots of money from concert tours.

234
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,647
Then it would be her turn to take it easy.

235
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,048
My sister would always talk about
such dream-like things.

236
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,558
Oh, well, it's a nice day today.

237
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,326
I guess you've been stuck inside
for a long time

238
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,894
since you're thinking like that,
haven't you?

239
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,159
For once, why don't you go out
and have fun?

240
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,398
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like doing that.

241
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,739
Now, now, if you continue like this,

242
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,333
Ami's dream won't come true.

243
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,812
It's certain that your piano playing
technique is incredible,

244
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:58,146
however, I guess that your music
died when your sister did.

245
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:02,676
I can't hear anything but sadness from
the sound you play now.

246
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,326
It's impossible to impress people
with a sound like that.

247
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,386
To become a famous pianist
is beyond a dream.

248
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,897
You can't be sad and stay inside
of your house forever.

249
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,733
You have to put an end to your sister's
tragedy as soon as possible!

250
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,099
Now...

251
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,311
Let's go out and party! Right, right, right?!

252
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,181
But all of a sudden...

253
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,683
Don't say things like that!

254
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,446
Excuse me, brother.

255
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,619
Kaori?

256
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,924
Ouch!

257
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,126
What the hell were you thinking?!

258
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:45,464
Miss Mami is in danger! Why are you
trying to get her to go out?!

259
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,230
But she needs to relax once in a while.

260
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,304
I'm against your plan anyway.

261
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,173
I think we should stay in the house
and keep quiet.

262
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,232
What Mr. Saeba said is right!

263
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,975
If Mami stays like this, she'll get sick.
I can tell.

264
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,351
Even if the murderer finds her, he can't
try anything in the crowds.

265
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,387
And also, if Mr. Saeba is with her,

266
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,722
he'll protect my sister if something
happens, won't he?

267
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,691
No, no way... Are you Miss Ami?

268
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,362
What the hell?!

269
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,599
Please don't hurt me! Please rest in peace!

270
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,334
Please God, purify her soul and...

271
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,136
Now, I'm going to go change.

272
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,838
Sure!

273
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,974
Well, isn't that, how should I say, convenient?

274
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,273
Well, I'm going with her, but what
are you going to do?

275
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,812
I see. Well, take care of the place
while I'm gone!

276
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:46,582
Date, date, the two of us alone,
but actually there are three...

277
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:51,063
Well, well, where shall we go? Ami, you
can choose your favorite hotel.

278
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,328
Well, let Mami choose it.

279
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,336
It's about time for me to go.

280
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,873
Since we're here now, I don't think she'd
say that she was going home.

281
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,275
Wait, wait a second, Ami!

282
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,146
I get very tired coming out in the
daytime like this. Bye.

283
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,206
Please stay at least for an hour.

284
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,684
Oh, where am I?

285
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:14,853
Hourly rate 2000 yen
Per night 5000 yen

286
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,846
Hourly rate 2000 yen
Per night 5000 yen
Damn, I was so close, and then I lost
my chance at mokkori!

287
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,221
I'm so sorry, brother.

288
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,623
Kaori, when did you...

289
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,068
Miss Kaori is here too.

290
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,526
I thought the more the merrier.

291
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,775
This place won't do.

292
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,745
Let's go someplace with a little class.
Right, Miss Mami?

293
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,737
What? I don't get it!

294
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,780
This is too much action for me.
I'm getting dizzy!

295
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,260
The color in your face is getting
a lot better, Miss Mami.

296
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,996
Just as you said, it's not a good idea
to stay home all the time.

297
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,871
Thank you, Mr. Saeba. I feel much better.

298
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,702
That's great!

299
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,909
That damned Kaori!

300
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,779
We need to be alone, just Mami and me.

301
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,613
House of Horrors

302
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,448
House of Horrors
House of Horrors?

303
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,676
House of Horrors

304
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,218
That's it!

305
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,754
What? Are we going in there?

306
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,693
No way, not there.

307
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,962
Then you can wait for us at the exit.

308
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,030
Well, let's go, Miss Mami! Let's go!

309
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,300
Well, I'm not good at handling
a place like this...

310
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,064
Don't worry. I'll be with you.

311
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,674
Damn, wait for me!

312
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,403
I said, wait!

313
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,588
Let's get out of here, Mr. Saeba.

314
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,558
I agree. It's not fun at all.

315
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,459
Both of you are such wimps!

316
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,871
Don't scare me like that.

317
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,304
Who are you?

318
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,279
Ryo! Ryo! Ryo! Help me!

319
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,854
Ryo!

320
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:33,223
Where... Where are you?! Ryo!

321
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,321
I did it!

322
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,466
However, I can't find Mami either.

323
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,703
Hey, Mami!

324
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,472
Mr. Saeba? Miss Kaori?

325
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,032
What should I do? I can't find them.

326
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,982
What? This is also a fake.

327
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,898
Really... Mr. Saeba!

328
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,661
Where are you?!

329
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,554
To be continued

330
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:43,522
If you're feeling, even though you
tend to your accessories

331
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:50,426
You can't compete against the
rainbows and stars

332
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:58,201
Tidings from the wind taught me

333
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:08,018
Your smile is important,
all of my love forever

334
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:14,448
Raise your downcast face
and look up at the sky

335
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:21,499
Give me peace in my hands, starting over

336
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:30,004
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

337
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:36,079
Heart and heart, at this very moment

338
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:45,986
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

339
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:51,824
Heart and heart, at this very moment

340
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,033
Smile and smile...

341
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,744
Help me, sister!

342
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,746
Mami! Mami!

343
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,347
At least...

344
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,317
I wanted to stay until I could at least
see Mami in a concert, but...

345
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,650
Okay, come to me, Miss Ami.
Come into my body.

346
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,887
Miss Kaori...

347
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,960
