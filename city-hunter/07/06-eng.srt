Piasu de kimetari, hade na mini o sagashitari

Kono mune no pazuru,

9
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,461
The weirdest incident in the
history of City Hunter.

10
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:38,198
I can't believe it, but the client,
Miss Ami Asaka, is a ghost!

11
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,534
She wants me to protect her younger
sister from her own killer.

12
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,069
She'll pay me in mokkori for doing this!

13
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,505
I'm going to take this client! Mami!

14
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,134
Hey, Ryo, you'll be paid by the older
sister, Miss Ami, won't you?

15
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,179
The younger sister, Miss Mami, will
play piano at a major concert!

16
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,549
How dare you take her to the House of
Horrors at the amusement park?!

17
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,484
What are you going to do if the
killer is waiting there?

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,750
Farewell Requiem
Your Visage, Once Again

19
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,893
Damn!

20
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,274
Mami, are you all right? Are you hurt?

21
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,673
Mr. Saeba...

22
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,947
A pistol?

23
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,780
You're not a policeman. Why?

24
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,220
You, who are you?!

25
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,624
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to trick you,

26
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,633
but in order to protect you,
I had no other choice.

27
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,902
I approached you by claiming that
I was your sister's fiancé.

28
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,529
All of that was to protect you.

29
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,569
My sister's fiancé? Was that a lie as well?!

30
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,581
Who are you anyway?!


31
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,450
Why did you lie to get close to me?

32
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,053
Oh, no, what I meant to tell you was...

33
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,888
No! Don't come near me!

34
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,724
Please listen to me, Mami.

35
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,089
No!

36
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,330
You tried to lose me so you could get at her,
but I won't let you do that!

37
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,259
You misunderstand me.

38
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,244
Jeez, you're such an idiot!

39
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,680
I can't believe that you told her
everything voluntarily.

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,171
I went off half-cocked, I guess.

41
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,354
In this situation, we don't have any other
choice except to tell Miss Mami the truth.

42
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:46,125
Actually, I'm protecting you because your
older sister's ghost asked me to.

43
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,218
Who the hell would believe that?!

44
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,328
I guess you're right.

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,229
But there's no other way.
I'll have to talk to her.

46
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,668
It's like throwing water on thirsty soil, I guess.

47
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,705
Enough is enough!

48
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,349
First, he lied to me about being
my sister's fiancé.

49
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,917
Now that I've learned the truth,
you're telling me

50
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,715
that my late sister asked you to guard me
and you're just doing that?!

51
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,122
It's impossible for me to believe you now.

52
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,296
I apologize for lying to you, but at that time,

53
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,432
we weren't sure whether you
were in danger or not.


54
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,968
Also, I didn't want to frighten you
without any evidence, so...

55
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,631
Please, please get out of here
as soon as possible.

56
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,880
Miss Mami, honestly speaking, I still
can't completely trust

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,617
the story that your late sister was the client.

58
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,553
But since I've been in contact with you,
both of you,

59
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,954
I've started to feel the bond
between you sisters.

60
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:57,160
Your sister's concern about you, and
your concern about your sister...

61
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,767
And I thought about how wonderful
you sisters were,

62
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,031
or else I wouldn't have accepted the request.

63
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,100
I also had a brother...

64
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,604
I'm sorry to have told you such weird stuff.

65
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,080
Sister...

66
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,048
Hey, Ryo, what're we going to do?
Are we really going home?

67
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,796
We'll keep working on this case,
since we already accepted it.

68
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,930
Besides...

69
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,026
If we quit now, Miss Ami might possess us!

70
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,805
I don't need to pretend that Ami's
my fiancée anymore,

71
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,171
so now I can put the moves on Mami.

72
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,085
The sound...

73
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,783
What? What's wrong with this piano?!

74
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,501
Mr. Saeba!

75
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,570
I thought it might be dangerous

76
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,605
if there was a bomb set to explode when
someone tapped the keys.

77
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,440
Don't do things like that without telling me!

78
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,109
I didn't ask anybody to guard me!

79
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,645
But your older sister asked me.

80
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,308
You feel anxious when you're alone,
don't you? Why can't you trust me?

81
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,684
I'm not worried, and I definitely
can't trust you.

82
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,618
Really, what a rude guy! Coming in here
without permission like that.

83
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,695
Yo, nothing's wrong with the bath.

84
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,137
Bathrooms in apartments are always
completely sealed in by doors.

85
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,265
I investigated it thoroughly, so it's safe now.


86
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,272
Enough of your nonsense!

87
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,480
Please trust me.

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,015
Please let me in! Please!

89
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,246
It's cold, I'm freezing!
I'm going to catch a cold!

90
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,693
Sister, do you really exist in me?

91
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,737
Did the man I saw today really kill you?

92
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,364
Does he intend to kill me too?

93
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,137
Did you ask Mr. Saeba to watch over me?

94
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,701
If that's true, I want you to answer me, sister.

95
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,949
I don't understand, sister.

96
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,726
Mami, Mami!

97
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,364
I'm close to you all the time.

98
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,798
In order to protect you, I'm always with you.

99
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,472
Please understand that.

100
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,292
Oh, no, when did I fall asleep?

101
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:15,895
To Mami

102
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,230
To Mami
A letter?

103
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,958
To Mami

104
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:20,500
From Ami

105
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,492
From Ami
A letter from my sister?

106
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,264
But it can't be...

107
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,004
This is from her. This handwriting is hers!

108
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,873
The person who asked Mr. Saeba
to guard me was my sister.

109
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,880
But that's impossible.

110
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,512
Please look outside the window.

111
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,151
I'm sure that there's someone who's watching
you, whose thoughts are the same as mine.

112
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,597
Mr. Saeba!

113
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,468
No way! Has he been standing there
all night for me?

114
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,845
Sister...

115
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,352
Damn, I got completely soaked by
the night's dew.

116
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:24,759
You'll catch cold. I already prepared some
hot coffee, so please come in.

117
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,192
Mami...

118
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:36,609
I can't say I fully trust you, but I guess I can
believe you for now, Mr. Strange Bodyguard.

119
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,579
Wakaba College of Arts

120
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,646
Wakaba College of Arts
There aren't many people at school during
summer vacation, so it looks kind of lonely.

121
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,550
There aren't many people at school during
summer vacation, so it looks kind of lonely.

122
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,587
The music hall is that way. Well, let's go.

123
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,822
You seem very eager, don't you, Mami?

124
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:54,782
It's because I'd like for my sister, who's
in me, to hear my best performance.

125
00:09:56,028 --> 00:10:00,132
At the concert, I'm going to play a
composition that my older sister loved.

126
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,270
If I perform terribly, then I don't know
what excuse I could offer her.

127
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,636
So, I have to practice and do my best!

128
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,043
But isn't it a little dangerous to practice here?

129
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:15,412
There aren't many people in the school, and
it would be easy for the killer to get you.

130
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,377
Exactly!

131
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,922
Mami almost got killed at the
House of Horrors!

132
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,958
Does that mean you're... Miss Ami?

133
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,627
Really, you're a ghost,

134
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,762
but you appear like this in the middle
of the day pretty often.

135
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,798
I don't want to come out like this,
but whose fault is that?

136
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,198
Who's usually being mokkori at
an important moment?

137
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,271
I'm so sorry, but I'm fine today.

138
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,207
Really! Can I trust you?

139
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,208
Sure!

140
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,008
Also, please don't forget about
paying me, Ami.

141
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,883
Well, about that...

142
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:51,951
See you later.

143
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,253
Wait a second! Hey!

144
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,523
What? What was I just doing?

145
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:01,127
Damn! Who gets too carried away,
her or me?

146
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,096
I'm starting to feel worried about
the mokkori payment.

147
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,463
Nothing important, nothing.


148
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,581
Please lock this door from the inside.

149
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,449
Yes!

150
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,184
Hey, Ryo, you come out too.

151
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,618
What? Can't I stay inside?

152
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,822
If you're with her,

153
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,958
Miss Mami won't be able to
concentrate on practicing.

154
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,227
First of all, there's only one door
to this room,

155
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,463
Sketch Practice
Summer School
Nude sketch class will
be held in Room A2
so all we need to do is guard
this door quietly.

156
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,361
So all we need to do is guard
this door quietly.

157
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,758
Ryo?

158
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,402
Sister...

159
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,067
I can neither say thank you,
nor talk to you.

160
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:53,311
So, at the concert, please listen
to my best performance.

161
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,482
As the very least of my feelings...

162
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,451
Nude...

163
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,557
That jerk, where did he go?

164
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,135
Now, let's get started. Please come in.

165
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,630
Yes!

166
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:30,214
No way! This is a fraud!

167
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,508
What the hell are you doing in here?

168
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,491
What? What's that smell?

169
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,861
Fire?!

170
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,062
I can't get it open!

171
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,541
Somebody, help me.

172
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,244
Sister...

173
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,485
Please help me.

174
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,156
Mami! Mami, Mami!

175
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,962
Really, I take my eyes off you for a second
and this is what happens!

176
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,966
But that door can't be opened
even if we did watch.

177
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,763
Shut up and come along.

178
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,005
Kaori, what's the matter? Kaori?!

179
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,610
My sister! She'll be killed!

180
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,116
You, you're Ami, aren't you?

181
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,140
Hurry up!

182
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,662
Mami... Mami, Mami!

183
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,031
Mr. Saeba is on his way, so please
pull yourself together, Mami!

184
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,434
Sister?

185
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,571
Sister!

186
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,903
Mami!

187
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,547
Mami, wake up!

188
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,983
Mr. Saeba...

189
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,348
You'll be fine.

190
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,650
Mr. Saeba, behind you!

191
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,193
Is splitting apart

192
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,995
these wonderful sisters

193
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,225
that much fun for you?!

194
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,786
Ryo!

195
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,385
That's ridiculous, isn't it, Ami?!

196
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,665
What is?

197
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,836
First of all, I never told you that I'd
pay you with my sister's body.

198
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,604
There's no way I could do that, you know?

199
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:10,337
But telling me to do mokkori with Kaori while
you possess her is ridiculous. No way!

200
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,346
What do you mean, no way? Miss Kaori
is a very attractive lady.

201
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,848
Stop joking around!

202
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,617
Both of you have been saying absurd
stuff about me while I've kept quiet.

203
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,853
I'm never going through that again!

204
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:25,391
Being possessed by a ghost was the
worst experience in my entire life.

205
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,849
What's that? I'll just borrow your body
for a little while.

206
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,198
No, no way! No! Hell No!

207
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,334
Well then, I'm sorry.

208
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,871
Let's forget about the entire
incident this time.

209
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,973
No! There's another way to
solve this problem!

210
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,975
You can find a beautiful woman
in town, possess her,

211
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,044
and then we can do mokkori.

212
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:49,315
Impossible. It's not like I can
possess just anyone.

213
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,977
If their wavelength doesn't match
mine, I just can't do it.

214
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,788
Also, I don't have much time left.

215
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,256
Time?

216
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:02,387
The problem's been solved, and I can't
stay in this world forever.

217
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,864
I wish I could stay longer, at least
until Mami's concert.

218
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,275
Oh, no!

219
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,436
Today, she's leaving today?!

220
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,107
No, it's too soon!

221
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,552
I was hoping she could at least stay
with me until the concert.

222
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:30,955
I wanted her to listen to my piano playing
in place of saying goodbye.

223
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,487
I wish I could be one of you,
Mr. Saeba and Miss Kaori.

224
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,463
Both of you can hear my sister's voice
and talk to her.

225
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,432
I can't even say goodbye to her.

226
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,883
Wakaba College of Arts

227
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,555
What are you going to do at
my college, Mr. Saeba?

228
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,079
Well, nothing really.

229
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,371
Ladies and gentlemen!

230
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,609
Now, it's time to start our private
concert for just the four of us!

231
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,978
The performer is Mami Asaka.

232
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,113
The audience is Ami and two others!

233
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,581
Mr. Saeba, what on earth are you doing?

234
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,087
It's not necessary to perform in a big concert.

235
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,991
The important thing is for you to see your
sister off with a perfect performance.

236
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,159
But...

237
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,389
You aren't satisfied with such
a small audience?

238
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,397
No, it's not that.

239
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,167
I don't have enough confidence in myself.

240
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,436
I haven't completed my lessons,

241
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,273
and I'm not sure that I'll be able to produce

242
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,942
a sound beautiful enough to satisfy my sister.

243
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,307
You'll be fine.

244
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,713
I know you can do it.

245
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,982
All you need to do is to put the feelings
you have for your sister

246
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,041
into your piano performance.

247
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,919
I'm positive that the sound will
come alive then. I promise.

248
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:14,922
Yes...

249
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,832
Sister, please listen and accept my feelings.

250
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,624
I can feel...

251

00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:02,305
Miss Mami's thoughts for Miss Ami
are surrounding this place.

252
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,741
It's just as if they're talking to each other.

253
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,811
Sister, my sister Ami...

254
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,650
Mami, Mami...

255
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,880
Miss Mami...

256
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,351
Miss Ami...

257
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:32,466
Wow, that was incredible. It was the
best performance ever, Mami.

258
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,006
Miss Mami...

259
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,808
Kaori?

260
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,979
Okay, come to me, Miss Ami.

261
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,686
Come into my body.

262
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,486
Miss Kaori...

263
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,563
Mami...

264
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:01,966
Sister...

265
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:09,936
Sister!

266
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,008
Mami...

267
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,494
It was incredible.

268
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,725
With that talent, you should have no problem
at the Chopin Competition.

269
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,767
Please don't flatter me like that.

270
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:41,106
But if I win, as I promised,
I'll earn lots of money

271
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:47,511
by doing many concert tours, and
I'll let you have fun, sister.

272
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,925
Mami, thank you.

273
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,951
Thank you, Miss Kaori, and Mr. Saeba.

274
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,667
She's gone.

275
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,786
Goodbye, sister.

276
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:48,834
If you're feeling kazari bakari ki ni shite mo

277
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,738
Niji to hoshi ni wa kanawa nai

278
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:03,513
Kaze no tayori ga oshiete kureta

279
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:13,330
Taisetsu na egao, all of my love forever

280
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:19,760
Utsumuita kao o agete, sora o aogi

281
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:26,811
Kono te ni yasuragi o, starting over

282
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:35,316
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

283
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:41,391
Heart and heart, kono toki o

284
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:51,298
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

285
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:57,136
Heart and heart, kono toki o

286
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,345
Smile and smile...

287
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,052
Ghosts... Do they really exist?

288
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,191
I feel as if all of this was a dream.
How about you?

289
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,395
But I also feel like I want to believe it.

290
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,692
That I might be able to see
my brother someday.

291
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,897
Let me tell you something. He's not dead.

292
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,264
He's in here and also in here.

293
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,808
When we want to meet him, we can
ask him to come out any time.

294
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,775
He's with us all the time.

295
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,320
Don't you think so?

296
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,944
All of you Umibozu fans in Japan,
sorry to have kept you waiting!

297
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,681
In the next episode, we're going to
show you Umibozu's private life!

298
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,616
I know he's the master of a café, but...

299
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,785
But nobody has ever seen him
for a whole day.

300
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,120
That's right!

301
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,689
So, I actually stayed close to him for
a day and got the information.

302
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,658
Will something happen?

303
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,828
The next episode of City Hunter '91,
from the café Cat's Eye...

304
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,728
Broadcast entirely live on location!

305
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,096
That Hayato Ijuin's
Extremely Peaceful Day
Broadcast entirely live on location!

306
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,465
That Hayato Ijuin's
Extremely Peaceful Day
Please look forward to it!

307
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,662
That Hayato Ijuin's
Extremely Peaceful Day
