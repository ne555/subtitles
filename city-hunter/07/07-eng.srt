1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Deciding on pierced earrings or
looking for a flashy mini-skirt

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Boys along the building wall, look,
they're waiting to ambush you

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Turn your heart into a game

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
If you have many things you want to do,
start the one you can

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
You can take it day by day, it's okay,
wherever you start from

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
If you can hold me tight,
I can treasure your smile

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
You can take it day by day, all right,
I've already realized

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
What the first piece to the
puzzle in my heart is

9
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,628
I'm leaving now. Are you really sure
you'll be all right by yourself?

10
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,290
This is your first time caring for the
shop all day by yourself, right?

11
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,394
Even a child could do this!

12
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,971
I see.

13
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,805
Okay, then I'll leave everything
to you, Master.

14
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,383
OPEN

15
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,857
Hayato Ijuin's
Peaceful Day

16
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,190
That Hayato Ijuin's
Peaceful Day

17
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,455
That Hayato Ijuin's
Extremely Peaceful Day

18
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:27,211
It's like time has come to a stop in this place.

19
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,680
How can Miki clean this place so carelessly?!


20
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,326
That's why there are so few
customers in this shop!

21
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,695
Scrub strongly this way and make sure
the corners are wiped thoroughly!

22
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,337
How do you like it now?

23
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,061
Good day.

24
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,541
I'm so sorry!

25
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,788
Welcome, please come in!

26
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,796
What can I get you?

27
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:21,234
Yes, Sir! If possible, I would like to
have a cup of coffee.

28
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,361
Coffee, I got it!

29
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,373
I guess I came to the wrong place.

30
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,108
But yesterday, a beautiful woman was here.

31
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,077
Why is a man like this here today?

32
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,445
How is it?

33
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,813
How is what, Sir?

34
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,650
Is the chair comfortable?
I polished it thoroughly.

35
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,886
It feels good, doesn't it?

36
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,723
Yes, Sir. It's very nice.

37
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,690
I see.

38
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,985
Here you go.

39
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,855
I'll finish this as fast as I can
and get out of here.

40
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,265
I finally found you, Ryo!

41
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,109
Punishment from God!

42
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,782
You're not Ryo.

43
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,687
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought Ryo was the
only customer in here.

44
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,317
What do you mean?

45
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,864
Ryo ran away from me as soon as we
found out the client was a man.

46
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,734
Again? But he didn't come in here.

47
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:32,364
I see. Sorry to be so noisy. Please
let me know if you see Ryo.

48
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,905
How long are you planning to hide there?

49
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,309
Oh, thank you, Umibozu.

50
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,854
I didn't mean to hide you from her.

51
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,290
I just didn't want you guys getting
violent inside here.

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,257
No way.

53
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,526
Hey, is Miki not here today?

54
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,653
Yeah, she had something to do today.

55
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,967
You've finished your business, haven't you?
Hurry up and go home.

56
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,605
Hey, you can let me hide in here
for a little while longer, right?

57
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,107
You have some nerve asking to stay here
when you owe so much money,

58
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,509
don't you think?

59
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,312
Please don't say such things.

60
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,248
I'll pay you back with my body!

61
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,081
Stop that! It's disgusting!

62
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,820
I'll tell Kaori to come and get you!

63
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,523
Whoa, wait a sec! Would you sell your
good friend to the enemy?

64
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,424
You're interfering with my business,
yet you call yourself a friend?

65
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,892
Now's my chance.
You're interfering with my business,
yet you call yourself a friend?

66
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,692
Women! Welcome!

67
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,042
What is it?

68
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,854
Yumi, you tell him.

69
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,723
Rie said she would.

70
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,759
So, let's all say it at the same time.

71
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,527
One, two...

72
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,764
Thank you very much for the other day!

73
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,965
Wow, we harmonized!

74
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,534
Amazing, we did it!
Wow, how great!

75
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:08,968
The other day?

76
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:09,769
Oh, no!
The other day?

77
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,428
Oh, no!

78
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,175
Well, those mean bikers were
picking on us, and...

79
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,244
You saved us!

80
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,836
Did you forget?

81
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,215
That time...

82
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,483
Yes, Sir!

83
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,786
And well, you might be surprised, but...

84
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,454
Hurry up and say it!

85
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,623
Then, why don't we say it at once?

86
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,590
Right.

87
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,061
We want to start a fan club!

88
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,099
With all our â™¥
Rie, Junko, Yumi

89
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,137
Fan club?

90
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:44,871
Yes, Sir.

91
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,807
But I wouldn't like something like that.

92
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,475
Does it bother you?

93
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,813
Well, it's not like that, but... Anyway...

94
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,915
Then it's okay?

95
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,250
It's okay!

96
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,651
Sure it's okay, right?

97
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,346
We did it!

98
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,356
See, I told you he was a kind man.

99
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,891
Really, I'm so happy.

100
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,159
Then, Yumi, you'll be the chairman.

101
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,193
What? I thought it'd be Junko.

102
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,895
I'm taking the position of the executive.

103
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,096
What's that?
You don't know? It was in
the Super Mask Show.

104
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,730
You don't know? It was in
the Super Mask Show.

105
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,831
No way!

106
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,867
Exactly what part of this octopus
is attractive to you?

107
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,803
Just who is this middle-aged man?

108
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,070
It's none of your business!

109
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,332
Just shut up.

110
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,575
I'll shut up, but if you have any older
sisters above the age of eighteen

111
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,907
please introduce them to me! Please?!

112
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,414
Don't try to get women by
using my customers.

113
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,611
Oh, oh, are your fans important to you,
you, octopus jerk?!

114
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,783
Don't call Mr. Ijuin such bad names!

115
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,390
Mr. Ijuin?!

116
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,630
Oh, Rie, how do you know his name?

117
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,766
You cheated us!

118
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:51,270
Well, the image from the name is
so far from the actual person

119
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,636
that I thought I shouldn't mention it.

120
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,108
You're absolutely right. His real name
is the monster Colonel Sanders.

121
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,016
No, I won't forgive you!
Get him!

122
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,785
You made me mad!

123
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,921
Take this, jerk!
Cut it out! Oh, no, not there!

124
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,411
That tickles!

125
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,088
Excuse me, but how much is this?

126
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,500
Sorry about this. I'll give you a free
sandwich and a cup of coffee,

127
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,400
so please stay longer, okay?

128
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,765
I really want to go home.

129
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,376
That was good! He's so kind.

130
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,345
He's so wonderful! Let's go back there again.

131
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,213
Yeah, I love him so much.

132
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,047
Damn! Aren't there any beautiful ladies
coming in here as customers?

133
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,186
Oh, I'm sure about it this time! Welcome!

134
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,001
I made a mistake. Have I caught a cold?

135
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,802
Idiots never catch cold.

136
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,037
What was that?!

137
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,131
Excuse me, but we're not open yet...

138
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,277
Don't interfere with my business!

139
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,246
What was that for?! You take her order then!

140
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,306
Sure, I won't allow you to help
female customers.

141
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,191
You're going to wait here again?

142
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,230
Yes, but I suspect he won't
show up today either.

143
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,541
After forty years, this town has
changed a great deal,

144
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,442
but I still remember this place.

145
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,608
I wonder if he's forgotten everything?

146
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,986
Mint tea, as usual?

147
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,387
Yes...

148
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,854
I'll be right back with it.

149
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,854
She's old, but she ordered a
fashionable item, didn't she?

150
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,399
You'll never understand her true feelings
behind a cup of mint tea.

151
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,901
I know that.

152
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:06,472
There's a legend that says mint keeps
the memory stronger, isn't there?

153
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,441
Oh, I didn't expect you to know
about such things.

154
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,478
It's something that I can use on women.

155
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,747
So, what's that old woman doing here?

156
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,614
She's waiting for her partner so they
can run away together.

157
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,321
I guess they promised to run away
together a long, long time ago,

158
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,758
but she comes here on the same day
every month, at the same time,

159
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,318
and looks outside just like she's doing now.

160
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,338
Here you go.

161
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,938
He'll be here. I know it.

162
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,726
I'm betting everything I have that
you're a sentimentalist.

163
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,061
This place is not a gambling joint.

164
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,945
Hey, hey, Umibozu!

165
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,379
When will Miki be back?

166
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,485
Damn, Miki's not here, and mokkori
customers never come to this place.

167
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,112
What a bad day!

168
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,824
Welcome.

169
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,725
Welcome to Cat's Eye.
Welcome.

170
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,023
Welcome to Cat's Eye.

171
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,330
Well, well, two mokkori ladies are finally here.

172
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,560
Let me take your bags. Here you go.

173
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,605
What are you doing, you octopus?!

174
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,608
I told you already that I wouldn't let
you help female customers.

175
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,643
Well, please come this way.

176
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,110
Ah, yes...

177
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,151
What's the matter, Umibozu?

178
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,487
Cat! A cat's in there!

179
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,355
Cat? Where?

180
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,457
Yes, in here.

181
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,255
No, don't let it out! Don't! Don't!

182
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,768
What are you going to do, Umibozu?

183
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,397
I'm not allowed to take care of
female customers, am I?

184
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,573
Do whatever you want!

185
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,108
Yes, Sir!

186
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,278
Now, please follow me to your seats.

187
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,336
All right...

188
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,120
And that's why he's scared of cats.

189
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,821
No way.
And that's why he's scared of cats.

190
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,622
No way.
You're kidding me.

191
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,122
It's true.
You're kidding me.

192
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,487
It's true.

193
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:17,296
Ryo, stop chattering with the customers
and come wash the dishes.

194
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,898
Did you say something, Umibozu?

195
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,162
Don't bring the cat! Not the cat!

196
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,270
I thought I heard something,
but I guess I didn't.

197
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,339
I've got you. Go away, or
I'm going to call Kaori.

198
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,738
Kaori!

199
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,645
I found you, Ryo!

200
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,052
What?

201
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,622
I'm sure that I just saw Ryo standing
here. Wasn't he, Umibozu?

202
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,831
What are you talking about? I haven't
seen him at all today.

203
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,359
That's strange. I was sure I just saw him.

204
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,270
Kaori, actually, Ryo is...

205
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,702
Meow!

206
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,532
What?

207
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,612
It's nothing really.

208
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,280
It's too hot today.

209
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,456
Damn!

210
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,595
Did you see how afraid of the cat he was?

211
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,429
I can't believe it.

212
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,397
This cat is so cute too.

213
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,073
The Steps to Passing
Your Entrance Exam

214
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:34,240
The Steps to Passing
Your Entrance Exam
All right!

215
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,541
All right!

216
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,133
I'm going to go home now!

217
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,874
I forgot to bring my wallet!

218
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,990
What?!

219
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,552
You don't have any money?!

220
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,696
Hot! Hot, hot, hot!

221
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,897
Suffer, suffer!

222
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,139
I want to go home, but I can't.

223
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,720
It's noisy out there.

224
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,822
I heard that there was a bank robbery.

225
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,659
Yeah, I heard that a policeman was shot.

226
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,128
Scary, isn't it? What happened to the robber?

227
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,222
He's still on the run, and he's armed!


228
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,967
Wow, how scary!

229
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:39,371
I wonder if Miki will be all right?
I hope she'll be back soon.

230
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,941
Oh, who is she?

231
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,742
She's my girl.

232
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,710
Just kidding!

233
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,817
She's the owner of this place
and is very beautiful.

234
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,486
You mean that she's working
for a master like him?

235
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:59,224
That's right. That evil master keeps her
here as a servant.

236
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,318
What a poor girl!

237
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,190
That's dangerous, you pedophile!

238
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,366
No way!

239
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,567
It's true!

240
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:13,138
He devised a plan to get girls, and
went after her while she was little

241
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,140
to make her fall in love with him.

242
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,677
Actually, Miki is one of his victims.

243
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,747
However, this shop is doing poorly
as you can see.

244
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,649
It's all his fault,

245
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,450
but the girl who loves him is out
selling matches on the street.

246
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,525
That mouth! You keep telling one lie
after another with it, you jerk!

247
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,892
You, there's a cat here. How can
you even do this?!

248
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,066
Weighing things in the balance,

249
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,261
the scale shows that you're the heavier one.

250
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,438
You made me eat something good,
didn't you?

251
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,841
I'll just add the price of the bread to
the amount you already owe.

252
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,376
You pushy salesman!

253
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,571
It's your punishment for saying too much!

254
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,505
I'm so lucky!

255
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,818
Here's the money. Bye!

256
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,944
Wait!

257
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,788
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

258
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,591
Here's your change.

259
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,635
The second cup of coffee and
the sandwich are on me.

260
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,195
You only need to pay for the first cup.

261
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,877
Well, thank you.

262
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,003
See you later!

263
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,727
It's a rifle!

264
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,368
Shut up, or I'm gonna kill you all.

265
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:02,276
I already killed one man at the bank.
Be quiet!

266
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,014
What? You murdered someone?

267
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,817
That's right. I did it.

268
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,725
He says so, but what shall we do, Umibozu?

269
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,989
I don't know.

270
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:20,799
I'll leave things to you. I'm busy
taking care of these ladies.

271
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,703
What?! Are you telling me that I have to
take care of an amateur like this?

272
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,438
You're the owner of this place.

273
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,639
What a selfish guy!

274
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,609
Exactly, how long have we
known each other?

275
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,345
Hey! Don't talk without my permission!

276
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,836
Shut up, don't tell me what to do!

277
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,973
See, why don't you listen to him a little?

278
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,955
What the hell? Do you want to disobey me?

279
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,294
What can I get for you today?

280
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,529
What?

281
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,090
Since you're a customer here, you
ought to order something.

282
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:01,065
Don't be ridiculous! Can't you see this gun?

283
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,811
No, I can't.

284
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,580
What?!

285
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,740
Die!

286
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,897
That was close.

287
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,594
It missed your head by an inch.

288
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,106
Shall I bend your head like this next?

289
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,710
Here, here, how about this?

290
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,812
Please forgive me!

291
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,381
I'll never do it again!

292
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,144
Here, here, here.

293
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,486
It hurts! It hurts! I'm sorry!

294
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,362
What?!

295
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,173
Damn, hurry up and get out of here!

296
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,879
But my cat!

297
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,676
We'll have to come back for it later.

298
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,839
Finally, I can go home.

299
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,556
I feel sorry for him.

300
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,025
Really, the interior of the
shop was destroyed.

301
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,060
No, I feel sorry for the robber.

302
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,631
He accidentally chose a place
where both of them were.

303
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,165
What? Was Ryo here?

304
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,201
Oh, you didn't know?

305
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,192
He was helping the beautiful ladies there.

306
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,340
That jerk! He cheated me again!

307
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,278
Where did that jerk go?!

308
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,552
I guess I'm having too much fun
with this situation.

309
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,180
Oh well, I won't regret it though.

310
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:41,257
So, how was your day?

311
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,598
The same as usual.

312
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,463
I guess...

313
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,969
As you say, the same as usual.

314
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,342
Well, let's hurry and clean this mess up.

315
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,451
Help me!

316
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,045
Wait!

317
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:03,889
Help me!

318
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,357
I said wait, wait, wait!

319
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,095
Wait, you bastard!

320
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,098
The same as usual.

321
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,442
Finally, I got you, you idiot!

322
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,144
Please forgive me, Kaori!

323
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,880
No way! I wasted an entire day
because of you!

324
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,549
I promise I won't do it again!

325
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,176
Hurry up and walk.

326
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:43,422
If you're feeling, even though you
tend to your accessories

327
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:50,326
You can't compete against the
rainbows and stars

328
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:58,101
Tidings from the wind taught me

329
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:07,918
Your smile is important,
all of my love forever

330
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:14,348
Raise your downcast face
and look up at the sky

331
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:21,399
Give me peace in my hands, starting over

332
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:29,903
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

333
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,979
Heart and heart, at this very moment

334
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:45,886
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

335
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,724
Heart and heart, at this very moment

336
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,933
Smile and smile...

337
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,240
Shut up, woman.

338
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,777
Woman? I'm your partner!

339
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,581
To me, Miki, you're just a woman.

340
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,117
Don't try to bed her like you usually do!

341
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,619
Don't show her a Japanese national shame!

342
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,555
This is my own free love,

343
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,922
and there's no reason for you
to say anything about it!

344
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,854
You agree with me, don't you, Ryo?

345
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:30,657
Revenge of the Beautiful Woman!
Sad Blues for Ryo
