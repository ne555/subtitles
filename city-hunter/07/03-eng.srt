1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Deciding on pierced earrings or
looking for a flashy mini-skirt

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Boys along the building wall, look,
they're waiting to ambush you

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Turn your heart into a game

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:50,742
If you have many things you want to do,
start the one you can

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
You can take it day by day, it's okay,
wherever you start from

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
If you can hold me tight,
I can treasure your smile

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
You can take it day by day, all right,
I've already realized

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
What the first piece to the
puzzle in my heart is

9
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,592
What? The Princess is missing?!

10
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,833
I am so sorry, Ambassador.


11
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,106
If you have time to apologize, why don't
you hurry up and look for her?!

12
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,095
Yes, Sir!

13
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,071
Oh, dear...

14
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:56,241
Even though we're on a personal trip,
she's still being a pain.

15
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,409
The coronation is only a month away!

16
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,564
Who killed the robin?

17
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,125
It was me, the robin said.

18
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,804
By my own knife

19
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,965
I killed myself.

20
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:27,602
The Beautiful Woman Who Buys Danger!
Memory Beyond the Light

21
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,826
Now, scene 92, while driving with your lover,

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,420
somebody fires at the car. Ready?

23
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:45,965
As usual, you'll drive the car while
dodging the explosions.

24
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,901
This time I'm the bodyguard for Yuki,
a mokkori stuntwoman!
As usual, you'll drive the car while
dodging the explosions.

25
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,637
This time I'm the bodyguard for Yuki,
a mokkori stuntwoman!
This bomb is more powerful than usual,
so please be careful.

26
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:55,074
In the car, just the two of us. How lucky I am!

27
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,312
Finally, please stop the car at the
edge of the cliff over there.

28
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,515
Yes! Leave things to me!

29
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,284
Hey, be quiet!

30
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,616
You're not the driver!

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,756
Oh, no, don't say such cruel things to me!

32
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,316
Let's get intimate, all right?

33
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,833
That jerk! He's out of control.

34
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,335
Ready?

35
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,428
All right, start!

36
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,477
Finally, we're alone, just the two of us.

37
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,921
Incredible! I feel as if we'll be blown up!

38
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,855
You're right.


39
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,847
If you don't want to die, you had
better not make a pass at me.

40
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,826
Right...

41
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,440
Aren't you driving a little too fast?

42
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,375
The brake's not working.

43
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,676
I see...

44
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,440
What?! The brake?!

45
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,581
The emergency brake doesn't work either.

46
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,416
I think somebody did something to it.

47
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,553
We don't have time to discuss that now.
Hurry up and turn around!

48
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,189
I can't! We're in a take.

49
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,858
But there's a cliff ahead, isn't there?

50
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,727
How do you think you're going to
stop the car?

51
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,785
Yuki!

52
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,666
The next one is the last bomb, isn't it?

53
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,537
Mr. Saeba?!

54
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,619
What are you doing? That's where
the bomb is!

55
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,560
Ryo!

56
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,878
The car stopped.

57
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,515
Mr. Saeba, are you all right?

58
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,695
Of course! A comfortable cushion
protected me!

59
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,185
Mr. Saeba!

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,331
Miss Yuki!

61
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,798
Miss Yuki!

62
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,734
Ryo!

63
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,964
Are you all right? Did you get hurt?

64
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,207
What went wrong? Did something happen?

65
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,575
Well...

66
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,668
Ah, actually...

67
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:49,582
The explosion was bigger than I expected,
so I clung to Yuki without thinking,

68
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,518
and that's why she turned the
wheel the wrong way.

69
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,112
I'm so sorry.

70
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,782
Don't try to escape by laughing,
you mokkori jerk!

71
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,329
It happened just as I thought it would.

72
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,372
Who were you keeping the brake
a secret from, Mr. Saeba?

73
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,880
Wasn't it Ryo's fault?

74
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,615
The expression on your face
caught my attention.

75
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,723
If they thought it was an accident again,

76
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,359
I would've been fired this time.

77
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,028
The fact that you go to such lengths
to be a stuntwoman

78
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,231
isn't just because you love it, is it?

79
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,131
There must be some other reason.

80
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,570
I started work as a stuntwoman
only a month ago,

81
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,164
and I don't have any memories
before that time.

82
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,244
When I'm performing a dangerous stunt,

83
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,014
I feel as if I might get my lost memories
back for a moment.

84
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:59,252
The more dangerous the stunt, the
stronger I feel like that, so...

85
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,881
Stunts are the only clue you
have, aren't they?

86
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:08,359
Yes, and that's why I can't quit now.

87
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,301
Mr. Saeba, you're staying in this room also?

88
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:24,177
Of course! I'm your bodyguard, aren't I?

89
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:28,481
So, let's get in the same bed and sleep,
shall we, shall we, shall we?

90
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:33,475
Yes, let's sleep! Ryo, there's a nice fluffy
bed ready for you on the roof.

91
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:43,117
Damn! Kaori definitely underestimates me,
doesn't she?

92
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:53,032
I wonder if Mr. Saeba is okay by himself
in a place like that?

93
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,832
I'm sure he's fine.

94
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,539
You're very gentle, Miss Yuki, aren't you?

95
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,249
Since you're a stuntwoman,

96
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,587
I thought you would be more masculine,
but you're very feminine,

97
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,055
as if you were the daughter of
a noble family or something.

98
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,096
Yes, Oikawa speaking.

99
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,031
Who killed the robin?

100
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,245
What's the matter? Is anything wrong?

101
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,872
Wrong number.

102
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,407
I see...

103
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,582
One more time! Go!

104
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,938
This time,

105
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,966
I can do it!

106
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,407
Who the hell opened the door so suddenly?!

107
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,583
Wow, Yuki!

108
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,953
I see, since I can't go to your room,

109
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,114
you came all the way here to
see me, didn't you?

110
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,497
No, why don't you come closer to me?

111
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,198
Hey, hey, a little bit closer.

112
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,868
What the hell is she thinking?!
Just a little more! Just thirty
centimeters more, Yuki!

113
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,369
Why did she come to see Ryo?
Just a little more! Just thirty
centimeters more, Yuki!

114
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,700
Why did she come to see Ryo?

115
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,840
Why do I feel so bad about this?!

116
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,616
Miss Yuki!

117
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,844
Kaori, hurry!

118
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,885
Look out!

119
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,607
Did anything strange happen
while I was gone?

120
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,910
Nothing much, just one phone call
and it was a wrong number.

121
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,070
That's it!

122
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,110
What do you mean?

123
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:19,952
Actually, after the accident the other day,
I investigated that car,

124
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,154
but there weren't any abnormalities
in the brakes or anywhere else.

125
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,781
It was then that I understood.

126
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,394
The series of accidents that
occurred during shooting

127
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:33,354
were not caused by someone's tricks
but by her mind.

128
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,428
By her mind?

129
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,205
Unconscious hypnosis, in other words,
mind control.

130
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,440
Mind control?

131
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,509
Someone hypnotized her into
believing that the brakes

132
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,773
would fail during filming, and she
would die in an accident.

133
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,349
This time, someone used the phone
and hypnotized her

134
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,485
to jump off the top of the building.

135
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,922
Oh, no, trying to make her kill herself...

136
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,287
It can't be!

137
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,984
He's enjoying this.

138
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,697
There are various types of killers.

139
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:08,567
Some use guns, some use knives
to cut the body into pieces.

140
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:13,139
In this case, the killer has to make
the target commit suicide,

141
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,972
but it has to happen in public.

142
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,870
Then tomorrow during the stunt...

143
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,616
That's right.

144
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,285
The stunt tomorrow will be on television.

145
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,879
It will be the best opportunity for the killer.

146
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,721
And at the same time, it will be
the end of his life.

147
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,139
Wow, what a big gallery!

148
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,244
Of course! It must be the first time
in Japanese movie history

149
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,548
that a real helicopter will explode in the air!


150
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,216
I guess they spend as much
money as they can

151
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,351
so they can compete with American movies.

152
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,219
Yes, so Yuki should do her best.


153
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,217
Miss Yuki, good luck.

154
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,366
Well, it's about time to start the meeting.

155
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,668
Ah, yeah!

156
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,470
Let's go to the lobby downstairs.

157
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,098
Then, Ryo and Miss Yuki, you...

158
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,241
They're both gone!

159
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,249
Mr. Saeba, where are we going?

160
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,878
We came to the beach, so we have to swim.

161
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,922
I brought a bathing suit for you of course!

162
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,258
And of course it's a high-leg cut!

163
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,225
Really!

164
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,821
Ya-hoo!

165
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:49,400
Feels so good! Yuki, hurry up
and come over here!

166
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,977
I'm not in the mood for swimming.

167
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,814
I can't believe that I was trying to kill myself.

168
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,974
I...

169
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,817
The hypnosis was why I thought I'd get
my memory back, wasn't it?

170
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:14,656
So, what should I believe from now on,
and how can I live?

171
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,931
I'm sure that the killer will
come for you today.

172
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,603
But at the same time, it's the
best chance you'll have.

173
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,745
He'll be able to remove the
block in your memory

174
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,047
because he's the one who hypnotized you.

175
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,117
So when he appears in front of you,

176
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,347
it'll be time for you to get
your memory back.

177
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,556
I promise you that I'll catch him.

178
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,860
So the only thing you need to do
is to wait for him.

179
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,895
I'm your bodyguard.

180
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:54,059
I'll be there no matter what danger comes
to you, and I will protect you.

181
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,238
Mr. Saeba, you're...

182
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,912
Hey, what are you doing?

183
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,149
That was mean! Why did you
do that all of a sudden?

184
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,784
Take this, revenge!

185
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,718
Hey, wait a second.

186
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,724
Oh, no, I can't run any further.

187
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,964
Mr. Saeba...

188
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,675
What the hell is this?! Kaori?!

189
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,839
See, Miss Yuki, it's easy to get him.

190
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,415
Here, here!

191
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,384
Kiss it, kiss it!

192
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:54,085
Excuse me, but you're Miss Yuki Oikawa,
the stuntwoman, aren't you?

193
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,425
Save me!

194
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,926
Who is that?

195
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,306
Maybe he's a television reporter?

196
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,432
Strange...

197
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,404
Who killed the robin?

198
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,717
Are you all right, Yuki?

199
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,184
Yes!

200
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:24,757
Wait!

201
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,019
Ryo!

202
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,359
Ryo!

203
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,826
Miss Yuki!

204
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,124
Wait!

205
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,472
Who asked you to do it?

206
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,134
Prince Alapanas!

207
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,477
Who the hell is he?

208
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,446
The prince of Alinamia.

209
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,815
Why does he want to kill Yuki?

210
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,615
If she dies, Prince Alapanas will
become the next king.

211
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,616
Then, Yuki is...

212
00:15:55,921 --> 00:16:00,085
Yes, she is Princess Yuki Grace of Alinamia.

213
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,870
Even though I'm not with her,
the mind control still works.

214
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,905
What?

215
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,506
After she jumps into the sea,

216
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:18,135
she won't be able to get back to the surface.

217
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,253
It sounds like nagging, but let me
explain this again, Miss Yuki.

218
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,755
Oh, yes, please.

219
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,191
First of all, you turn the automatic
pilot on above the water.

220
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,559
Then, the pilot will...

221
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,584
What? Is something wrong?

222
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,764
Who killed the robin?

223
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,562
Now she's as good as dead.

224
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,502
Idiot!

225
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,178
Idiot, you can't win against me
without a weapon.

226
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,918
Ten seconds until the explosion.

227
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,763
Damn, I wonder where Ryo went?!

228
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,097
Nine...

229
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,766
Eight...

230
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,134
Seven...

231
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,702
Six...

232
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,470
Five more seconds.

233
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,805
Four...

234
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,772
Three...

235
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,631
Two...

236
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,476
One...

237
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,444
Zero!

238
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,353
Wow! Incredible! Wow!

239
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,750
What?!

240
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,563
What's going on?


241
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,963
My hands, my legs...

242
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,470
Hey, she hasn't come to the surface yet.

243
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,062
What's wrong with the stuntwoman?

244
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,132
Something weird is happening.

245
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:55,974
Is Yuki all right?

246
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,944
What the hell are you standing around for?!
Where's the rescue boat?!
Is Yuki all right?

247
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,138
What the hell are you standing around for?!
Where's the rescue boat?!

248
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,008
Ryo... Where are you, Ryo?

249
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,453
No matter what you do, your hands
and legs will be so numb

250
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,184
that you'll sink to the bottom of the sea.

251
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,721
Somebody...

252
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,928
Ryo!

253
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,986
Who's that?

254
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,637
Ryo!

255
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,217
Mr. Saeba!

256
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,141
What are you saying?

257
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,381
Miss Yuki is the Princess of Alinamia?

258
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:14,045
Yes, Your Highness, you are the princess
of our country, Alinamia.

259
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,021
Please feel at ease.

260
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,592
In our country, Prince Alapanas has
already been deported.

261
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,026
Really, there's nothing to worry about.

262
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,898
It's a bad joke.

263
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,368
Me, a princess?

264
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:34,173
It's not a joke. Please do not worry
about your amnesia.

265
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,843
A mind control specialist was called in
from our country and is already here.

266
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,277
Your memory will be back soon.

267
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,607
Princess?!

268
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,892
Yuki!

269
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,435
I... I don't know what to do now.

270
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,937
I know I've been seeking my
memory for a long time,

271
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,307
but now I don't care about my past.

272
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,709
I've realized that there are more
important things to me.

273
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,077
Mr. Saeba...

274
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,722
I don't want to change anything anymore.

275
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,122
I want to stay as I am now, forever.

276
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,927
Here we are.

277
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,773
This place...

278
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,709
Mr. Saeba!

279
00:20:55,687 --> 00:21:02,616
I know that you've realized that this
is the only place you can go.

280
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,008
Mr. Saeba, thank you.

281
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,752
I'll ask someone to erase
my memories of you.

282
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,644
Then I won't need to feel so sad.

283
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,551
Yuki...

284
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,919
Mr. Saeba!

285
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,428
Goodbye...

286
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,318
Wow, that's Princess Grace.
She's so beautiful!

287
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:04,389
Yeah, I've heard that she's going back to her
country today for the coronation ceremony.

288
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,482
Wow, how wonderful!

289
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,011
I know that you restrained yourself.

290
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,242
You silly, who are you talking about?

291
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:43,288
If you're feeling, even though you
tend to your accessories

292
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,192
You can't compete against the
rainbows and stars

293
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:57,967
Tidings from the wind taught me

294
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,785
Your smile is important,
all of my love forever

295
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:14,214
Raise your downcast face
and look up at the sky

296
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:21,265
Give me peace in my hands, starting over

297
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:29,768
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

298
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,845
Heart and heart, at this very moment

299
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:45,753
Smile and smile, you are the angel
on a shooting star

300
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:51,590
Heart and heart, at this very moment

301
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,800
Smile and smile...

302
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,042
Oh, I haven't told you about it, have I?

303
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,169
I am a professional at helping
people escape.

304
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:16,621
Therefore, the money he paid me with
was that of a desperate old man.

305
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,589
I will help him escape, I swear it.

306
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:30,524
With a Class A License for Love
Here She Is, a Beautiful Pro
at Helping People Escape
