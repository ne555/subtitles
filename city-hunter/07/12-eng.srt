That's why it happened!

10
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,765
No way!

11
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,031
Ryo, your toast is ready! Hurry and wake up!

12
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,574
Damn, he sleeps forever when
he doesn't have any work.

13
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,279
We've just learned that Queen Rika,

14
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,517
once known as a modern-day Cinderella,
has gotten a divorce.

15
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,720
Wow, Queen Rika, I was in high school
when that happened.
Right, it's been six years since
her shocking marriage,

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,489
Wow, Queen Rika, I was in high school
when that happened.
And they've now broken up after all.

17
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:02,922
And they've now broken up after all.

18
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,226
I guess everyone is curious
about her alimony.

19
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,229
She'll be receiving five hundred billion
in Japanese yen!

20
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,297
Incredible!

21
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,267
I wish I could have that much money.

22
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:14,734
Five hundred billion yen... I could eat a
5,000 yen steak a hundred million times.
I wish I could have that much money.

23
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:18,771
Five hundred billion yen... I could eat a
5,000 yen steak a hundred million times.
Despite her divorce, I'm sure women
around the world will still envy her.

24
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,140
Despite her divorce, I'm sure women
around the world will still envy her.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,841
But I can't imagine how many times
a hundred million is.
Despite her divorce, I'm sure women
around the world will still envy her.

26
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:22,705
But I can't imagine how many times
a hundred million is.

27
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,344
It's beyond my understanding.

28
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,445
Good morning.

29
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,947
You didn't wake up, so I finished
my breakfast without you.

30
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,141
Yes, Ma'am.

31
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,051
Is there any interesting news today?

32
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:32,652
Queen Rika has gotten divorced.

33
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,521
Now, let's review Queen Rika's life
for the past six years.
Queen Rika has gotten divorced.

Now, let's review Queen Rika's life
for the past six years.
Queen Rika?

35
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,152
Now, let's review Queen Rika's life
for the past six years.

36
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:42,095
The Meraldo Kingdom is a small country with
only one point three million people.

37
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:42,929
What? That necklace...
The Meraldo Kingdom is a small country with

38
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,464
What? That necklace...
Queen Rika became known there
six years ago.

39
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,232
I have the same one.
Queen Rika became known there
six years ago.

40
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,699
Queen Rika became known there
six years ago.

41
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,699
The secret treasure exhibition
was held in Tokyo.

42
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,975
That woman!

00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:00,912
Memories of the Necklace Incident
Ryo, a Bad Girl & Makimura

44
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,780
Shinjuku 198X

45
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,365
You'll catch a cold.

46
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,334
I don't like rain with such high acidity.

47
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,061
Oh, it stopped already!

48
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,134
Why don't we take a walk until
our clothes dry?

49
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,999
Yeah, that's a great idea!

50
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:03,034
Well, my name is Ryo Saeba, I'm single,
and have no fiancÃ©.

51
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,042
I am Rika Shiraishi, twenty years old.

52
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:11,551
I wish I could say I'm twenty as well,
but I'm a little older than that.

53
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,454
Mr. Saeba, to be honest,

54
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,014
I was walking without an
umbrella on purpose.

55
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,058
On purpose?

56
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:24,163
Yes, I've been longing to meet
someone like this.

57
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:29,931
Someday, a sweet prince will appear and
protect me under his umbrella.

58
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,235
And here I am.

59
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,410
Mr. Saeba, would you start dating me?

60
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,310
Dating?

61
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:45,815
I know that you're the prince whom
I've been looking for.

62
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,618
Me?!

63
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,322
No way...

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,101
Well, let's go in.

65
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,229
Oh, my, you're so aggressive!

66
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,268
Mr. Saeba, please hurry up!

67
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,151
Mysterious Treasure: Now Showing:
The Secret Treasure of the Meraldo Kingdom
This is what she meant. I'm so disappointed.

68
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,674
This is what she meant. I'm so disappointed.

69
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,954
Wow, how wonderful!

70
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,512
They're so beautiful!
Wow, how wonderful!

71
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:32,432
Wow, it's incredible! Rika, are you
interested in this stuff?

72
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,558
Yes.

73
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,139
You can't go beyond this point.

74
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,155
Wow, it's that necklace that's
worth ten billion yen.

75
00:05:56,155 --> 00:06:00,927
People say that an angel can take
a nap on that big emerald.

76
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,454
I see; that's why it's called the Angel's Cradle.

77
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,498
You're going to steal that necklace?!

78
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,466
It's not stealing. It's recovery!

79
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,771
Recovery? What are you talking about?

80
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,242
It belongs to my grandmother.

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,983
My grandfather, who was the
ambassador to Meraldo,

82
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,077
got it for my grandmother as a present.

83
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,956
Why do you want it back?

84
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:34,694
He was forced to surrender and was
arrested by the Meraldo government.

85
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,062
After returning to her country,

86
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,998
she cried many times, hoping for him
to be returned to her.

87
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,525
Then my grandmother... Last spring...

88
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,304
So I really want to get that necklace back
on behalf of my grandmother.

89
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:59,852
I see, that's the reason you
approached me, isn't it?

90
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,618
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to trick you.

91
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:09,262
I'm sorry, but you chose the wrong person.
I'm not a professional thief.

92
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,833
No, I need you. I need your shooting skill!

93
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,925
And...

94
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,269
And?


95
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,706
Even though I was able to
set up our meeting,

96
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,674
I can't control my passion.

97
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,346
Wow, how aggressive!

98
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,085
My heart is beating so fast.
I'm not lying to you!

99
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,278
I... I'm afraid that I'm falling in
love with you, Mr. Saeba.

100
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,603
This is the nineteenth floor
of the Crown Hotel,

101
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,662
and this is the exhibition room.

102
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,443
Unbelievable, Rika. Did you prepare
all of these by yourself?

103
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,206
Well, yes.

104
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,949
I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to
sneak into the exhibition room;

105
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,818
however, the problem is this
sensor on the ceiling.

106
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,380
As long as it's activated, nobody can
go further than the pillars.

107
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,828
Then, what you're saying is that you
want me to destroy that sensor?

108
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,992
Yes, however, you can't aim
at the sensor directly.

109
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,034
What do you mean?

110
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:27,807
This, the beam in front of the sensor hides it.

111
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,244
I see, no matter how good I am,

112
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,913
it's almost impossible to aim at
a target that I can't see.

113
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,015
I want you to make it possible.

114
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,108
I'll pay whatever you want.

115
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,954
I don't need money. I want you to
pay me with something else.

116
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,793
Something else?

117
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:54,522
I meant that if I am your prince,
I want you to be my princess.

118
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,835
I understand.

119
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,874
You mean that you want me, don't you?

120
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,342
Bingo, bingo, bingo!

121
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,878
Okay.

122
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,074
If you get the necklace back for me...

123
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,683
I'll give you anything you want.

124
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,157
Rika!

125
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,591
Give it to me in advance!

126
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,126
You're so impatient. Wait until
everything's done.

127
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,337
Hey, are you sure that you're going home?

128
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,040
For today...

129
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,639
This is it.

130
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,272
See you tomorrow.

131
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,449
I'll be happier tomorrow than I was today.

132
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,452
How's it going?

133
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,080
The problem is the back wall.

134
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,714
What do you mean?

135
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,359
Someone's been following us for a while.

136
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,393
Stay here.

137
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,363
Mr. Saeba!

138
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,294
Mr. Saeba...

139
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,697
You can do it.

140
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,185
What do you want from my Rika?

141
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,196
How did you get in here?!

142
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,427
It'd be simple to kill you right here.

143
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,368
Don't scare me like that. You almost
made me wet myself.

144
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,675
By the way, the silencer is not
attached to your gun.

145
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,974
Well, of course you can't put one
on there since it's a revolver.

146
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,282
You haven't been following us
since yesterday

147
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,716
just to tell me some stupid
jokes, have you?

148
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,621
Well, let me be frank.

149
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,819
Don't get close to Rika Shiraishi
if you don't want to get hurt.

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,658
Have you been hurt already?

151
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,699
Unfortunately, I think she hates me.

152
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,601
I thought so. You're too different
from her type.

153
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,140
I don't care if you want to be her knight.

154
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,576
Did you fall in love with her just because
you got to touch her breasts?

155
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,448
Well, that's fine.

156
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,383
I hope you're careful not to get burned.

157
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,985
Her breasts are very dangerous.

158
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,423
Wait!

159
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,892
Before you leave here, wash your hands.

160
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,238
Tonight?!

161
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:24,744
But tonight is the reception for
the King of Meraldo, isn't it?

162
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,114
Right, so the guard will be tighter than usual.

163
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,081
Then why...


164
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,884
Because we'll attack them at their
most vulnerable moment.

165
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,488
We'll wait for the point when they're
being relieved after the reception.

166
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:40,493
I see, I'm pretty impressed.
You're just like a professional.

167
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,927
Oh, really?

168
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,946
King of Meraldo
Welcome Reception

169
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,082
He's younger than I expected.

170
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:08,053
I've heard that the purpose of this
is so the king can find a wife.

171
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,557
Wow! Then he'll choose from among
the girls over there?

172
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,388
I envy them!

173
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,067
Please accept this.

174
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,127
It's beautiful! Thank you.

175
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,309
Are you all right?

176
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,800
Someone is trying to steal the Angel's Cradle.

177
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,234
It really is the Cig P-210,
famous for its accuracy.

178
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,448
Well, it's about time to go, isn't it?

179
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,118
Room 1901 - 1910
Lounge Bar

180
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,733
Where are you going?

181
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,002
I brought some refreshments
for you as a gift.

182
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,264
A gift?

183
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,829
From the King to his Guard.

184
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,276
How nice!

185
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,311
Then please bring them to our waiting room.

186
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,335
Yes, Sir.

187
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,514
Let's go!

188
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,916
Well, Mr. Saeba.

189
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,694
The sensor is aligned with the
chandelier, isn't it?

190
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,048
It's called armor piercing.

191
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,712
I shot a hardened bullet through the wall.

192
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,889
Then...

193
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,365
You did it!

194
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,230
Wait, I missed.

195
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,033
What do you mean?

196
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:43,541
This is the reason. This carpet altered
the bullet's trajectory.

197
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,044
Carpet?

198
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,104
The floor wasn't covered by carpet yesterday.

199
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,115
I'm pretty sure that they installed this
today for the reception.

200
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,282
As long as this is here, it's impossible
to make a bullet ricochet.

201
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,623
Oh, no!

202
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:04,330
Oh, no, Mr. Saeba! What are you
going to do now?! What?!

203
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,790
Well, don't get so excited. Trust me.

204
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,337
What is it?

205
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,933
If you do what you did yesterday,
I might come up with an idea.

206
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,381
You! We don't have time to
fool around like this!

207
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,918
Oh, really? Then you don't care
about this any more?

208
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:32,591
If you kiss me here, I'm sure that I would
come up with a great idea.

209
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,024
Fine!

210
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,921
Just once, okay?

211
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,909
All right! I did it! I did it!

212
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,045
I kissed Rika on her lips!

213
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,747
Mr. Saeba!

214
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,873
Here you go.

215
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,709
What are you going to do?

216
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,912
You'll find out!

217
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,660
Even if it's a sensor,

218
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,152
I know it won't detect an object
on the surface of the floor.

219
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,412
You did it! You did it, Mr. Saeba! We got it!

220
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,824
The Angel's Cradle...

221
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,882
Let's hurry!

222
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,328
Hey, you two!

223
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,329
You, wait up!

224
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,297
Wait!

225
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,398
Damn!

226
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,367
We'd better separate.

227
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,501
Okay!

228
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,003
Here!

229
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,205
Please keep the necklace for a while.

230
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,873
Are you sure?

231
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,842
I'll pay you back in exchange for it.

232
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,900
I got it.

233
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,620
She checked out already?!

234
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,292
Okay, thanks.

235
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,495
Well, I know she'll contact me to get it back.

236
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,999
Then, I can...


237
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,993
Would you please spend some time
with me for a bit?

238
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,723
Women find me so attractive recently.

239
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,531
The other hand.

240
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,759
Yes, Ma'am!


241
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,473
Hey, didn't I tell you?

242
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:06,274
You! You're cops!

243
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,352
Wow!

244
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,526
Because of you, I got this back.

245
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,619
The Angel's Cradle is safe now.

246
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,662
I'm glad to hear that!

247
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,463
I didn't have any idea what to do.

248
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,038
My heart was about to burst.

249
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,640
I'm sorry to hear that.

250
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,471
It's still beating so hard.

251
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,010
Here!

252
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,915
See? Did you feel it?

253
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:47,113
Oh, my prince, I'm afraid I can't stop
myself from loving you.

254
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,321
Ms. Rika!

255
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,289
Yes?

256
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,590
Ms. Rika!

257
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,581
I've been looking for a woman like you!

258
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,919
Do you mind if I ask you to
come to my country?

259
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,163
It'd be my pleasure.

260
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,801
Well, you can go home now.

261
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,642
She said this necklace was given to you.

262
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,311
It's a fake, but it's still worth
about 10,000 yen.

263
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,917
A fake?!

264
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:28,594
The real one was given to her as
a token of her engagement.

265
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,824
Engagement? To whom?

266
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,756
The owner of the necklace, of course,
the King of Meraldo.

267
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,871
What was that?!

268
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:45,741
She was able to meet him because of you,
and she appreciates it.

269
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,137
Damn!

270
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,710
I don't need this!

271
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,557
Well, it's useless to turn your anger on it.

272
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,827
It's very pretty even if it is a fake.

273
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,228
Then you can borrow it.

274
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,366
Are you sure?

275
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,601
I think my sister would like it.

276
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,831
Sister? Is she beautiful?

277
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,006
She's a high school student.

278
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh, never mind.

279
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:20,335
Your weak point is that you show
interest in any kind of woman.

280
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,775
Not any kind, she has to be
a mokkori beauty.

281
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,620
Well, don't be careless enough to believe
you're that attractive.

282
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,088
Thank you so very much for your advice.

283
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,639
I think it's the same as the one
my brother gave me.

284
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:57,683
Hey, Ryo, you said something a little
while ago. Do you know Queen Rika?

285
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,918
What? No!

286
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,783
I think I was thinking about
the wrong person.

287
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,213
Oh, well...

288
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,828
Kaori...

289
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,591
What is it?

290
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,431
It's been a long time. Why don't we
go see your brother?

291
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,742
What's up with you all of a sudden?

292
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,768
Well, there's no reason in particular.

293
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:43,255
If you're feeling kazari bakari ki ni shite mo

294
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:50,159
Niji to hoshi ni wa kanawa nai

295
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:57,934
Kaze no tayori ga oshiete kureta

296
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:07,751
Taisetsu na egao, all of my love forever

297
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,181
Utsumuita kao o agete, sora o aogi

298
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:21,232
Kono te ni yasuragi o, starting over

299
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:29,737
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

300
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,813
Heart and heart, kono toki o

301
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:45,719
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

302
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,557
Heart and heart, kono toki o

303
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,766
Smile and smile...

304
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,003
Hans told me to give this to you.

305
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,642
If you hurt Ms. Kaori, I'll kill you.

306
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,155
Which of us will die, you or me?

307
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:21,057
If you want to save this woman, both of you,
fight to the death right now!
