00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,584
Piasu de kimetari, hade na mini o sagashitari

00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:35,033
Biru no kabe ni boys, hora,

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:41,597
Heart o game ni shite shimae

Shitai koto bakari aru nara,

00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:58,552
Day by day, ii ja nai, okay nani kara demo

00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:06,598
Dakishimerarereba, hohoemi o
taisetsu ni dekiru kara

00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:14,534
Day by day, ii ja nai, all right

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:24,605
Kono mune no pazuru,
hajime no hitotsu kizuiteru

9
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,507
I haven't seen you in a long time, Falcon.

10
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,077
Sonia...

11
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,716
I came to hear your answer.

12
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:40,393
Will you take on the task of
avenging my papa?

13
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,920
I want you to eliminate Ryo Saeba
from this world.

14
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,530
Revenge of the Beautiful Woman!
Sad Blues for Ryo

15
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:07,211
A four-leaf clover pendant? It's so pretty.

16
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,416
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands,
ten thousands...

17
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,330
Over budget, there's no way I can afford that.


18
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,061
Well, since it's a clover, I'd better
look for a real one.

19
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,738
Umibozu's strange?

20
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,507
Yes, he is.

21
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,676
You didn't know that already?

22
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,769
Not in that way.

23
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,216
For some reason, he's more
nervous than usual,

24
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,818
and he's been treating me rather coldly.

25
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,553
He's like that all the time, isn't he?

26
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,957
No! It's not the same. I can tell!

27
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,793
Did he find another woman or something?

28
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,062
No way. You know him well,

29
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,429
so you must understand that Falcon would
never do something like that.

30
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,801
I don't know about that.

31
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,396
He meets beautiful women in strange
situations that we don't know about.

32
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,044
If that's the case, why don't you
break up with that octopus

33
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,444
and get together with me?!

34
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,250
Miki!

35
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,353
Hey, hey, don't joke around like that
in front of the shop.

36
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,322
What are you going to do if Falcon sees us?!

37
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,224
That's the whole point.

38
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,454
Mr. Saeba!

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,561
What?

40
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,635
What?! That octopus is really
having an affair!

41
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,037
That woman is a blonde mokkori beauty!

42
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,265
That can't be...

43
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,948
That's... Sonia?

44
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,007
Do you know her?

45
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,620
When I was in America...

46
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,223
I had a partner. She's his daughter.

47
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,654
And I...

48
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,162
I killed her father.

49
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,271
Ryo Saeba!

50
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,866
You betrayed my papa and killed him!
I won't forgive you!

51
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,076
Sonia!

52
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,845
Wait!

53
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,375
Ryo!

54
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,790
Long time no see, Ryo!

55
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,779
Wow!

56
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,917
Sonia, why are you here?

57
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you surprised? I came to see you,
Ryo, all the way from America.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,034
Doesn't that make you happy?

59
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:39,005
Of course I am! You've certainly grown a lot.

60
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,996
I'm so happy to see you!

61
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,158
You jerk! You'd mokkori a foreign girl
in the middle of the street!

62
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,785
You national shame of Japan!

63
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,254
Kaori...

64
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,001
Oh, I didn't know that.

65
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,671
Your father used to work with Ryo?

66
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,807
I'm Sonia Field. Nice to meet you.

67
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,799
And are you a sweeper as well, Ms. Sonia?

68
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,546
I'm an ordinary office worker.

69
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,785
It was Kenny's will. He wanted his
daughter to live an ordinary life.

70
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,843
Will?

71
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,249
It's been ten years since my papa died.

72
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,821
It was a traffic accident.

73
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,297
Excuse me, Ms. Kaori.

74
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,635
Ms. Kaori, you're Ryo's partner,

75
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,297
but you guys aren't engaged or
anything like that, are you?

76
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,242
No way! Don't joke like that!

77
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,144
Wow, I'm relieved to hear that.

78
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,238
What do you mean by that?

79
00:06:54,814 --> 00:07:00,013
I've always believed that the only
person I would marry was Ryo!

80
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,872
I'm sorry, Ryo. I know that
I came here so suddenly.

81
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,396
What?

82
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,143
Oh, don't worry about it.

83
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:31,481
But anyway, you've grown quite beautiful
since I last saw you.

84
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,879
She wants to marry me.

85
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,858
Can I talk to you for a second, Ryo?

86
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,131
Hey, are you okay with letting her
stay at Saeba's place, Falcon?

87
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,871
My eyes aren't just little holes.

88
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,150
I know that you realize what
she was doing, but...

89
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,656
Just in case, let me ask you, did she ask
you to do something about him?

90
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,749
Hey, Falcon, answer me.

91
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,558
Shut up, woman.

92
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,466
Woman? I'm your partner!

93
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:24,095
To me, Miki, you're just a woman.

94
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,006
A man who lives in the underground world
like me doesn't need a partner in life.

95
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,683
Falcon...

96
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,259
Listen, I hope you understand this already!

97
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,661
She's our important guest.

98
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,264
Don't try to bed her like you usually do!

99
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,789
Don't show her a national shame of Japan!

100
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,003
Hey, are you listening to me, Ryo?

101
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:01,531
First of all, do you know what day
it is three days from now?

102
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,274
What day is it?

103
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,146
It's your birthday!

104
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,783
That's right! I totally forgot about it!

105
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,085
Then how old am I going to be?

106
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:17,283
It's a pretty good number. So, I hope
that you'll mature a bit.

107
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,525
Kaori...

108
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,051
What?

109
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,869
I can understand being hit by a hammer
when I try to woo a client!

110
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,707
However, Sonia is not one! On top of that,
she actually likes me!

111
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,310
This is my own free love,

112
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,508
and there's no reason for you
to say anything about it!

113
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,318
That's all I have to say. Understood, Kaori?

114
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:50,085
I see. I'm going to be twenty-one
years old three days from now.

115
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,784
I guess I lost.

116
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,200
Ryo!


117
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,339
Why don't we take a bath together?

118
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,707
Oh, yes, oh, yes!

119
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,250
Don't! That's so imprudent.

120
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,878
We used to take baths together
all the time back then.

121
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,657
It was when you were a kid, wasn't it?

122
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,716
Kaori, free love.

123
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,227
Free love!

124
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,924
I understand. I'm going to go check
the temperature of the water.

125
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,287
I was trying to put the hammer away
when my hand slipped.

126
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,058
How careless of me!

127
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:03,461
I'm so sorry. If you want to take a bath,
please use the public facility.

128
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,298
Hey...

129
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,426
We'll definitely sleep together
in the same bed, right?

130
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,933
Oh, yes, yes.

131
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,749
She said that the bed's broken.

132
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,960
This is what I have to put up with.

133
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,450
I'm so sad.

134
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,011
Falcon,

135
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,775
I need to get your answer today.

136
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,588
Why won't you say anything?! I know that
you have a grudge against him!

137
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:40,252
I know that your body still has the
scars of hatred Saeba caused!

138
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,423
And also, my papa saved you,
so you owe him, don't you?!

139
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,300
I understand.

140
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,703
He's your friend now, and you've
forgotten your hatred for him.

141
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,309
It's okay then. If you won't do it, I will!

142
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,869
You can't win.

143
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,481
I know that,

144
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,247
but I'll be able to make Saeba feel
the same pain that I've felt.

145
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,621
The pain of having your loved ones
taken away.

146
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,788
You mean Kaori, don't you?

147
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,797
So long, Mr. Inflated Killer.

148
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,764
Wait!

149
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,134
Who said that I refused?

150
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,736
There are some conditions though.

151
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:28,139
I want to settle this clearly, not shoot him
in the back or anything like that.

152
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,677
You mean a duel?

153
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,179
That's right.

154
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,347
All right, do whatever you want to.

155
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,077
Do you agree to this, Ryo?!

156
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,553
Yes.

157
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,330
Sonia, I guess you didn't obey
Kenny's will, did you?

158
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,899
What will?!

159
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,503
You tried to hide the truth and stop me
from approaching the underground.

160
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,165
You lied to me! You...

161
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,708
I entered your world,

162
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,911
and I trained to improve my marksmanship
so I could take revenge.

163
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,282
But I've realized that I'll never be
skilled enough to kill you!

164
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,182
That's why I asked Falcon to do it for me.


165
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,655
Why do you look so sad? You can't
fool me any longer!

166
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,749
You're an evil assassin lacking anything
resembling compassion!

167
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,223
I'm going to stand back and
watch as you die!

168
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,226
Sonia!

169
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,773
I have another condition to
accepting your request.

170
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,002
After I kill Saeba, promise me that you'll
leave the underground world.

171
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,507
Sure, that was my original plan anyway.

172
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:54,059
We look like characters from old Japanese
samurai tales, don't we?

173
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,924
Standing on the Gojo Bridge in Kyoto...

174
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,526
Three days from now, got it?

175
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,999
So that's the reason you wanted to
end our partnership?

176
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,049
You aren't confident that you can win
against Mr. Saeba, are you?

177
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,552
I have confidence, if it happens soon.

178
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,782
Then why did you want to end it?!

179
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,319
If it happens soon?

180
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,121
Falcon!

181
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,331
You!

182
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,041
You took Ms. Sonia out and
did what with her?

183
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,847
I see! Ms. Sonia's gone.

184
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,849
I'm so sorry about that.

185
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,919
I'm sorry, Ryo. I'll put some
bandages on you.

186
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,688
Oh, it hurt, didn't it?

187
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,089
I know! Today, let's eat something
delicious to celebrate.

188
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,294
My birthday is the day after
tomorrow, isn't it?

189
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,592
A pre-celebration, why not?

190
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,929
I'm going shopping.

191
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,032
Kenny!

192
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,086
Umibozu...

193
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,598
Ophthalmologist

194
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,793
Closed

195
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,075
Falcon...

196
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:50,876
There you are.
Falcon...

197
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,677
There you are.

198
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,811
Kaori...

199
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,146
What's the matter?

200
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,240
Nothing, I just have something
to think about.

201
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,251
Then you're closing for the day?

202
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,087
Oh, never mind, let me make
some fresh coffee for you.

203
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,256
I saw Umibozu a little while ago.

204
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,622
Something was wrong with him.
Did you two have a fight?

205
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,494
You saw Falcon?!

206
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,828
Well, not really.

207
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,423
I passed by him when he left the
ophthalmologist's office.

208
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,330
Ophthalmologist's?

209
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,532
I have confidence, if it happens soon.

210
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,636
Kaori, where is the clinic you saw him at?

211
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,942
Then, she ran out of there without
telling me anything.

212
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,718
I wonder if Umibozu has some kind
of bad eye disease?

213
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,653
Ryo, do you have any idea?

214
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,622
His eyesight has been bad for a long time.

215
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,351
He hurt his eyes a long time ago.
It might have gotten worse.

216
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,627
And the person who hurt him was me.

217
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,166
Falcon!

218
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,547
I guess he disappeared, just as
I thought he would.

219
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,673
Saeba...

220
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,951
When the situation goes bad for him,
he quickly runs away

221
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,187
and seals himself up inside of his mind.

222
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,917
Really, he's such an uncertain
and gloomy guy.

223
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,482
It's a good opportunity for you, isn't it?
Why don't you switch to me?

224
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,701
Whose fault do you think this is?!

225
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,703
You were the one who got him
involved in this situation!

226
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,872
Why do you think you understand him?!

227
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,609
A person like you has no right to talk
about him badly like that!

228
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,440
A person like you...

229
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,707
A person like you...

230
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,027
I'm sorry. I found out about Falcon's...

231
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,263
I already know about his eyes.

232
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,958
Then, the duel would be...

233
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,999
You know best about his nature, I guess.

234
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,433
Saeba...

235
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,802
Did you really kill Sonia's father?

236
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:08,041
Please tell me the truth.
I have the right to know.

237
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,755
Yes!

238
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,313
Who is it?

239
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,390
I want you to come with me, Ms. Kaori.

240
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,541
Why did you do something like that?!

241
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,816
He'll be there regardless of whether
we take Kaori hostage.

242
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,485
He's not the kind of man who
would run away from this.

243
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,987
But he betrayed my papa
and murdered him.

244
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,114
Do you honestly think that I can
trust a person like that?

245
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,994
It is certain that he killed your
father, Kenny Field.

246
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,121
However, nobody knows the
full story behind it.

247
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,569
Since he killed his partner, there must
be a reason. I'm sure of it.

248
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,198
Is he so special? If there was a reason,
it was okay to kill him?

249
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,409
That man killed my papa.

250
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,036
That's enough, isn't it?

251
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,415
Anyway, I'm going to let Kaori go free.

252
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,212
This place is my hideout after all.

253
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,987
You can go home now.

254
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:35,167
Is it true that Ryo killed Ms. Sonia's father?

255
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,136
That's why you and Ryo are
going to duel, isn't it?

256
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,871
That's right.

257
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,041
No way! Ryo would never do such a thing!

258
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,977
Why, why do you need to duel?

259
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,647
Please, please stop this. It's foolish!

260
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,047
I can't stop this.

261
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,153
It's because of your wounded eyes, isn't it?
Is that why you hate Ryo?

262
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,089
How do you know about that?

263
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,158
I understand why you would hate the
person who did that to you,

264
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:04,062
but I can't accept that both of you
hate each other enough to duel!

265
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,326
Please, Umibozu!

266
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,499
Well, I don't really hate him.

267
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,407
My eyes were hurt when I was in
a mercenary company.

268
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,510
The enemy at that time was coincidently Ryo.

269
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,180
In war, it'd be endless if you started
hating enemies one by one.

270
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,478
I don't hate him.

271
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,348
Then why?

272
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,813
When I hurt my eyes, Kenny was
the one who saved me.

273
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:36,295
Without his help, my vision would've
been completely lost.

274
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,498
Well, I guess that's enough. This has
nothing to do with you.

275
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,766
Hurry up and go home.

276
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,833
No!

277
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,871
I'm confused. I don't know what to do,

278
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,507
but I don't want you and Ryo to fight.

279
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,101
Until you say you'll cancel the duel,
I'm not going home.

280
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,845
Do whatever you want then!

281
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,146
Papa...

282
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:37,388
To be continued

283
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:43,322
If you're feeling kazari bakari ki ni shite mo

284
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:50,226
Niji to hoshi ni wa kanawa nai

285
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:58,001
Kaze no tayori ga oshiete kureta

286
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:07,818
Taisetsu na egao, all of my love forever

287
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:14,247
Utsumuita kao o agete, sora o aogi

288
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:21,299
Kono te ni yasuragi o, starting over

289
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:29,803
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

290
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,879
Heart and heart, kono toki o

291
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:45,786
Smile and smile, kimi wa ryuusei no angel

292
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,624
Heart and heart, kono toki o

293
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,833
Smile and smile...

294
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,606
Ryo!

295
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,733
Kaori! Don't! Don't come over here!

296
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,567
I've got you!

297
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,647
Umibozu, I'm right here!

298
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,886
Stop!

299
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:30,468
The Place Where Gun Smoke Goes
City Hunter Dies at Dawn!
