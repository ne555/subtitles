1
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,473
That guy is the target this time.

2
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,032
For solving problems or finding
missing persons,

3
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,768
please remember the Saeba
Agency every time!

4
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,271
Yeah, yeah, please remember us.

5
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,074
We won't get any clients
with you acting like that.

6
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,775
Can't you be friendlier?

7
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,766
Let's see... be friendlier...

8
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,680
Yoo-hoo!

9
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,585
How are you doing? I'm "Friendly
Ryo". What's your name?

10
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,720
Hinako.

11
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,087
Oh, what a cute name!
Hinako.

12
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,755
Oh, what a cute name!

13
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,626
Well, Hinako, why don't we go to a
hotel and cement our friendship?

14
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,093
Hey, wait a second!

15
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,989
Who the hell told you
to be that friendly?

16
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,635
Geez, I can't let my guard
down for a second!

17
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,571
You don't need to do anything
now. So stay down there!

18
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,038
Yes, Ma'am.

19
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,378
Can you help me?

20
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,381
Got one! A sexy blonde
after such a long time!

21
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,619
Mysteries, troubles or missing persons!

22
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,422
You can ask us for anything. The
Saeba Agency will bring you
happiness!

23
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,856
Yes, that's better! You
can do it if you try.

24
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,456
Don't become an
international embarrassment!

25
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,457
Hey, hey, hey! It's rude to act
like that in front of a client!

26
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,235
A client?

27
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,002
My name is Emily O'Hara.
Nice to meet you.

28
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,083
The Mafia is after you?

29
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,819
That's why I ran so far
from LA: to escape.

30
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,049
But why is the Mafia looking for you?

31
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,159
The Mafia boss out there
has this perverted son.

32
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,996
He was too persistent about
trying to get me in bed,

33
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,699
so I kicked him in the nuts.

34
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,867
He had to go straight
to the hospital.

35
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:58,359
The boss got mad and
sent a hit man after me.

36
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,141
How brave you are!

37
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,146
The son is trying to calm
his father down.

38
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,273
So after a month or so,
everything should be fine.

39
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,285
Until then, I want you to guard me.

40
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,150
I'll pay you one million dollars.

41
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,455
One million dollars?

42
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,520
Let's see, if one dollar is
about a hundred fifty yen...

43
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,896
150,000,000 yen?!

44
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,736
That pervert gave me a
cruiser last Christmas.

45
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,863
I'm sure I can get the
cash by selling it.

46
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,774
Okay, okay, you can trust us!

47
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,110
We promise we'll protect you.
Right, Ryo?

48
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,577
Denied.

49
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,339
You're scared of the Mafia, aren't you?

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,449
It doesn't matter if the enemy is
the Mafia or even the military.

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,610
I only take on a client if the
conditions are acceptable.

52
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,153
Are you saying a million
dollars isn't enough?

53
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,651
Money is not the point!

54
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,457
What do you mean?

55
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,693
No way!

56
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,060
You got it. The answer is: NOOKIE!
No way!

57
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,255
You got it. The answer is: NOOKIE!

58
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,156
You jerk! You figured out
her weakness and...

59
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,263
Are you going to give
up a million dollars?

60
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,069
Or add nookie on top of a million
dollars? Choose one.

61
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,540
A million dollars and nookie?

62
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,098
No nookie, no million dollars?

63
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,570
I got it! I'LL lay you!

64
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,276
Don't you want to be with me?

65
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,722
Okay, just this one time,
you get nookie.

66
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,555
Wow, I get it! I get some
nookie! Wow!

67
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,861
Okay, okay. Your request
and nookie are accepted!

68
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,029
Nookie?

69
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,363
Oh, yes. Nookie, okay? Understand?
Nookie?

70
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,565
Oh, yes. Nookie, okay? Understand?

71
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,760
Oh, nookie. Okay, okay.

72
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,236
I wonder if she understands?

73
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:41,263
I have to be strong! I have to be
patient for a million dollars!

74
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,776
Duck!

75
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,247
He's quick to retreat, isn't he?

76
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,019
Emily?

77
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,020
Don't help her up, Kaori!
Emily?

78
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,487
Don't help her up, Kaori!

79
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,954
What's the matter?

80
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,458
Her panties are crystal blue

81
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,949
with a high-cut design to allow
free movement of the leg.

82
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,855
You're the shame of the
nation, pervert!

83
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,334
What?! It was a deposit
towards the nookie!

84
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,670
I'll give you a deposit with
this sexy hammer!

85
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,438
Hey, I don't want that!

86
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,440
You turned down sex with me
pretty quick, didn't you?!

87
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,843
Do I have the wrong person?

88
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,334
I wouldn't do it with you even
if it were free!

89
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,880
I guess he's the one.

90
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:32,384
Mr. Saeba, why do I need to move
from the hotel to your apartment?

91
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,151
It's simple.

92
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,965
It will be easier for me to
protect you at my place

93
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,160
rather than at the hotel where
there are more people.

94
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,337
Indeed. You consider lots
of things, don't you?

95
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,438
Only when it comes to nookie.

96
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:45,838
Kaori, I could still refuse this client!
Only when it comes to nookie.

97
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,574
Kaori, I could still refuse this client!

98
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,779
Oh, no, no way! Do whatever
you want to, Mr. Saeba.

99
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,246
Right then!

100
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,563
Here. Ten thousand for a deposit.

101
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,068
Oh my God! We've never had
a deposit so big before!

102
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,671
Hey, Ryo, look! A check for
ten thousand dollars!

103
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,334
That's nice. I wonder if Emily
is tired after her long trip?

104
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,244
Why haven't you asked her if she'd like
to take a shower before dinner?

105
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,114
Ah, he's right. I'm sorry
I didn't think of that.

106
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,981
I'll show you where the bathroom
is when you're ready.

107
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,156
Please use this bath towel.

108
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,191
Thank you.

109
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:38,658
How long are you going
to stay there, Ryo?
Thank you.

110
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,489
How long are you going
to stay there, Ryo?

111
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,163
Who am I? How did I get here?

112
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,171
You get nookie now over
my dead body!

113
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,341
Emily, make sure to lock
the door from inside.

114
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,741
Yes, I understand.

115
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,712
She broke the promise!

116
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,925
But Nookie Hunter Ryo
never gives up!

117
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,528
Wonderful! Kaori doesn't
even compare!

118
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,941
Who doesn't even compare?

119
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,380
I failed again, but
I won't give up!

120
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,860
Where is my lingerie?

121
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,003
Kaori, stop! You've got
to listen to my story!

122
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,337
It was just a sudden impulse!

123
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:58,504
Your nookie excuse limit is three.
It was just a sudden impulse!

124
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,273
Your nookie excuse limit is three.

125
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,537
Next time, it won't be a threat!

126
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,244
Did you have a relaxing shower?

127
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,612
Yes.

128
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:06,746
A gun?
Yes.

129
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,613
A gun?

130
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,114
A gun?
Oh, this! I thought the hit man
was here to kill me, so...

131
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,515
Oh, this! I thought the hit man
was here to kill me, so...

132
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,021
Besides, everybody in
the U.S. has a gun.

133
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,421
But I've never actually fired it.

134
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,593
Is that so? I think you've had
special advanced training.

135
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,031
Am I wrong?

136
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,891
How can you tell things like that, Ryo?

137
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,237
I wonder if it's because of my
high-cut panties,

138
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,905
which allow full leg movement?

139
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,373
Bingo!

140
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,036
Wow, Americans like you
can get the joke too!

141
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,347
I can't tell whether he's serious,
or if he's just joking.

142
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,320
This is not good.

143
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,956
Kaori seems to know all my moves.

144
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,924
I have to think of an original
way to attack.

145
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,157
Ryo, I'm going shopping for dinner,
so please take care of Emily.

146
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,300
No way!

147
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,170
This must be a dream! Kaori wouldn't
do something like this!

148
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,298
She wouldn't go out and leave Emily in
the cage of a wild animal!

149
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,543
I know. It's a trap!

150
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,847
She set all kinds of traps between
here and Emily's room.

151
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,315
Kaori, you're making light of me.

152
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,510
I would shame myself as a man if
I didn't take a chance like this!

153
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,253
No trap scares me if there's
nookie at the end.

154
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,756
Here I go!

155
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:31,391
That's strange! Usually, something
would be happening to me by now.

156
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,333
Nothing looks suspicious.

157
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:45,811
I get it! Kaori must approve
of my getting nookie.

158
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,336
Ms. Kaori, thank you for the nookie.

159
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,081
Emily!

160
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,913
What? This feeling is familiar.

161
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,893
Yes, Kaori told me to try it,
because it would be fun.

162
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,432
It is really fun! That felt good!

163
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,633
Right! Again!

164
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:07,933
Stop! It's not a toy!
Right! Again!

165
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,370
Stop! It's not a toy!

166
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,705
Don't come any closer!

167
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:12,872
Are you scared of this
thing that much?
Don't come any closer!

168
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,340
Are you scared of this
thing that much?

169
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm not scared! It's just dangerous
for you to carry it around!

170
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,168
Yeah! There!

171
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,747
This is so much fun!

172
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,783
Mr. Saeba, let's play some more.

173
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,386
Some other time.
It's time for my nap.

174
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,978
Well, goodnight!

175
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,620
You're no fun.

176
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,560
How about this, Mama?

177
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,330
Green onions, three for eighty-eight
yen? This is cheap!

178
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,327
Umibozou, are you
shopping for dinner?

179
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:50,537
Kaori?! Oh well, Miki has a fever,
so I have no choice.

180
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,513
Oh, Miki has a fever?
You must be busy then.

181
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:59,246
Oh, nothing to worry about. Well,
you're buying a lot, aren't you?

182
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,280
We have a guest. A
million dollar client!

183
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:04,790
To kill someone?

184
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,491
No way! We're bodyguards.
To kill someone?

185
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,859
No way! We're bodyguards.

186
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,961
That's too much money for
just guarding someone.

187
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,763
You think so?

188
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,253
I've heard a strange rumor.

189
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,929
Someone came from far away to
kill Ryo. From LA.

190
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,473
From LA? But it's a man, isn't it?

191
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,964
I don't have any further
information. Bye.

192
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,175
To kill Ryo? From LA?

193
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,285
No way!

194
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,591
Watch over me, Brother.

195
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,389
I promise I'll avenge you.

196
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,216
He's off his guard. Anybody
could shoot him now.

197
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,661
This man is the City Hunter?

198
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,128
I can't believe it.

199
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,168
Ryo!

200
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,104
Ryo!

201
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,413
Emily, where is Ryo?

202
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,871
What's got you so upset?
He's sleeping.

203
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,851
Ryo! Ryo! Are you all right?

204
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,624
Why are you being so noisy?

205
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,092
Good! You're all right.

206
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,697
What's the matter? Why did you
wake me up so suddenly?

207
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,333
Oh, I'm so hungry. What's for dinner?

208
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,823
Ah, I forgot.

209
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,436
You went shopping for nothing?

210
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,780
I'm sorry we ended
up with take out.

211
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,839
Don't be sorry. I love sushi!

212
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,609
Besides, this is probably
better than Kaori's cooking.

213
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,488
Well, please go ahead and eat.

214
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,955
Yes, thank you.

215
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,198
Delicious! Sushi tastes
so much better here.

216
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm glad to hear that.

217
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,567
Emily, you use chopsticks
very well, don't you?

218
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,771
I love Japanese food, so I go to

219
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,607
Japanese restaurants pretty often
in Los Angeles.

220
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,074
Los Angeles...

221
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,541
Someone came from far away to
kill Ryo. From LA.

222
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,617
Oh, not Emily.

223
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,881
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

224
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,723
What's wrong, Kaori? You look sad.

225
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,560
Emily, why don't we go
out for a little while?

226
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,528
I know a shop that serves
delicious coffee.

227
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,889
Oh, sounds good. Please
take me there.

228
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,135
What part of that bastard's coffee
do you think is delicious?

229
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,738
It's delicious! On top of that,
Miki has a fever,

230
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,307
so we need to go cheer
her up. Please.

231
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:12,011
Fever? I see. She's probably sweating
a lot because of the fever.

232
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,013
I should take her some
extra underwear.

233
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,503
Yes, you're right.

234
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:23,211
If I take Emily to Umibozou, we
might discover something.

235
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,992
Well, this is it.

236
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,001
Hi.

237
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:36,902
Oh, Mr. Saeba, welcome.
Hi.

238
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,037
Oh, Mr. Saeba, welcome.

239
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,572
Well, you look fine.

240
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,767
Aren't you scared of being
alone with Umibozou?

241
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,578
I was happy until this very moment.

242
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,281
Good evening, Miki.
How is your fever?

243
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,816
It's not serious.

244
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,619
I have a little fever, but Falcon
is taking it so seriously.

245
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,187
Ah, I see.

246
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,357
This is Emily. We've been guarding her.

247
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,326
This is Miki and Umibozou.

248
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,327
Nice to meet you.

249
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:01,827
Same to you.
Nice to meet you.

250
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,794
Same to you.

251
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,669
Well, well, let's go sit and relax until
the delicious coffee is ready.

252
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,001
Umibozou, what do you think?

253
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,505
Remember? The person from
LA who came to kill Ryo?

254
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,346
I told you I didn't have any
other information. But...

255
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,113
But what?

256
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:21,847
She has a callus on her hand
from firing a gun.
But what?

257
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,747
She has a callus on her hand
from firing a gun.

258
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,319
It's not easy to get a callus
from normal practice.

259
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,879
You'd need to shoot like crazy.

260
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,125
Like crazy? Then she is the one.

261
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,727
I didn't say that.

262
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,395
What I said was that it's rare
for someone to

263
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,063
get a callus from practicing.

264
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,032
I'm sure Ryo has already spotted
a simple thing like that.

265
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:46,731
I don't think so, because Ryo's mind is
clouded by his desire for nookie.

266
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,980
What?

267
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,124
Douglas?!

268
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,029
No! It'll explode!

269
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,168
He could have gone out through the
door. He acts like such a big shot.

270
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,110
It's dangerous, Emily.
Let Ryo handle this!

271
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,873
Let me go! Douglas is here!

272
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,080
Douglas?

273
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,722
City Hunter, I'm going to kill you.

274
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,681
And after you're gone, I will
take over the underworld.

275
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,646
This is his real nature!

276
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,382
His movements, his decisions, his look.

277
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,145
Everything is different from
the way he was before.

278
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,653
This was just my greeting. Say
your prayers and wait for me.

279
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,696
Mr. Saeba, are you all right?

280
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,459
Yes, somehow I'm fine.

281
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,605
Douglas!

282
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,809
Don't waste your bullets.

283
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,572
He's already out of range.

284
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,215
I guess I'm the one being targeted,
aren't I?

285
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,714
Emily O'Hara, twenty-five years old.
CIA agent.

286
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:52,364
Belongs to the LA branch office.
Employee number ST249960.

287
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,932
You knew all along, didn't you?

288
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,062
The gun you have, a Centennial
Army custom combat .44 magnum,

289
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,273
is too powerful for a woman to
carry for personal protection.

290
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,671
On top of that, you have
a callus from the gun.

291
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,414
Even a professional doesn't
get one easily.

292
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,939
I want you to tell me everything,
no secrets.

293
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,885
I understand.

294
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:20,659
Falcon, you shouldn't get involved
with Mr. Saeba any more.

295
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,327
Yes, I know.

296
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,997
Nothing good ever happens to me
when I get involved with him.

297
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,099
Hey, your tie is crooked.

298
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,158
Stop it! What would we do
if Ryo saw us?! Cut it out!

299
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,271
An employee of the CIA?

300
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,239
I came to Japan, because
I followed Douglas.

301
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,372
You're not a killer!

302
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,611
Douglas is an assassin

303
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,613
who is becoming the new big thing
in the criminal underworld.

304
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,581
Well, I should say he is a terrorist.

305
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,885
He uses radio-controlled models
with explosive materials in them.

306
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,415
This year alone, five VIPs have already
been assassinated in the West.

307
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,925
If these murders were all
he was involved in,

308
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,626
the CIA wouldn't have
taken covert action.

309
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,585
But six months ago, a CIA employee
became another victim.

310
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,400
The agent was not involved in any
important mission at the time.

311
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,263
We couldn't figure out why Douglas
chose him as a target.

312
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,007
The CIA's been chasing Douglas to

313
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,838
discover the motive behind
the incident.

314
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,445
Then, we received information
that Douglas had

315
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,640
chosen City Hunter as a target.

316
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:21,008
The best way to catch Douglas
is to be close to the target.

317
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,586
And the shooting earlier today was
staged to make me believe you, right?

318
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,862
Yes. We used a CIA agent stationed
in Japan. I'm sorry.

319
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,099
But why does he want to kill Ryo?

320
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,669
We don't know yet.
But killing Mr. Saeba

321
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,161
would certainly make Douglas famous.

322
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,442
Well, we'll find out by
asking him directly.

323
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,878
Then you're going to help me?

324
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,574
The CIA will pay you a million
dollars as I promised before.

325
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,718
No way! Even if you pay
us a million dollars,

326
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,853
I don't want Ryo becoming a target.

327
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:59,313
You're silly, Kaori. I'll be a target
whether I help her or not.

328
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,859
But...

329
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,426
If I'll be a target anyway,
But...

330
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,995
If I'll be a target anyway,

331
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,163
it's better to get a million
dollars for it, isn't it?

332
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,499
You still want nookie instead of a
million dollars, don't you?

333
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,966
Ah, well...

334
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,983
Finished! Japanese plastic models
are the best in the world!

335
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,386
Now, the next one is a Harley FXE.

336
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,354
I'm going to finish it before
tomorrow morning.

337
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,764
Great! You certainly
are a CIA agent.

338
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,426
I'm nothing to speak of. It's
just the result of practice.

339
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,171
I'd like to see you in action,
City Hunter.

340
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,116
A single entry point! Incredible!

341
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,252
This is truly a custom combat magnum.

342
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,220
It's as good as a snappy.

343
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,854
I guess I haven't practiced enough.

344
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,824
It's useless.

345
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,097
Your way of shooting is full of hate.

346
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,598
When your mind is not calm,

347
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,065
it's useless for you to take
target practice.

348
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,194
What do you mean?

349
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,273
You're not practicing
to protect yourself.

350
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,937
It's to kill someone. To avenge
your brother that was killed.

351
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,878
Avenge her brother?

352
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,548
I see. You've already
figured that out.

353
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:35,746
Yes, the CIA agent who was
killed was my brother, Daniel.

354
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:41,318
It happened while my brother
was on a fishing vacation.

355
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,038
It was so horrible. There
was nothing left.

356
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,684
At that time, I promised myself I would
avenge my brother's death.

357
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,152
That's why I requested to be
transferred from

358
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,620
my desk job to this position.

359
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,655
I don't intend to capture Douglas
and return home with him.

360
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,317
I'm going home with a corpse.

361
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,421
I don't want to tell you what to do,

362
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,026
but a gun is not a tool for murder.

363
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,999
Yes, it is.


364
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,336
When someone pulls the trigger, the
only desire in his heart is to kill.

365
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,463
The trigger is pulled by your mind.

366
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,677
You can't understand my pain!

367
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,713
You don't know how painful it was for
me when my brother was killed.

368
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,180
You don't know.

369
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,115
I know.

370
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,284
My brother was also murdered.

371
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,787
Kaori...

372
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,087
It was the same for Ryo. Ryo and
my brother were best friends.
Kaori...

373
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,454
It was the same for Ryo. Ryo and
my brother were best friends.

374
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,069
What do you want?
Why did you call me?

375
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:09,445
I have new information about that
Emily you asked me to investigate.

376
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,645
The CIA office in LA hasn't given her
an official mission to capture Douglas.

377
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,188
Really?

378
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:16,555
Yes. During the incident with
General Gillam,
Really?

379
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,825
Yes. During the incident with
General Gillam,

380
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,327
I met Mr. Norton with the Pentagon.

381
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,895
I asked him to investigate the matter.

382
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,556
This is good information.

383
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,900
However, Emily's supervisor,
Dick, arrived in Japan today.

384
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,834
I wonder why?

385
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,376
Please rest in peace, Brother.
I promise I'll avenge you.

386
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,247
Yes.

387
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,015
Emily, you have a phone call.

388
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,284
Me?

389
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,786
He said you would know who he was
if I said his name was "Dick".

390
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,254
He's my section manager.

391
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,188
Hello?

392
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:50,755
Hi, Emily.
Hello?

393
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,923
Hi, Emily.

394
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,187
I've just arrived in Japan.

395
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,728
It seems our plan is going
well, doesn't it?

396
00:24:56,728 --> 00:25:00,789
Actually, I have good news. We've
found out where Douglas is.

397
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,365
What? Where is he?
Where is Douglas?!

398
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,337
Douglas?

399
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,408
Emily, wait until Ryo is back!

400
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,036
What shall I do? I have to follow her!

401
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,612
Taxi!

402
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,723
I have to stop her no matter what!

403
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,094
Hey, Kaori, where is my lunch?

404
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,133
Kaori? That's strange. I wonder
where she went?

405
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,441
That's it! That's where Douglas is.

406
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,603
Oh, no, I didn't make it!

407
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,729
Sleeping gas?

408
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,704
Emily!

409
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,337
Emily! Emily, what's the matter?
Get a hold of yourself!

410
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,017
Who?

411
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,870
I can get her while Kaori is gone.

412
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,428
Yoo-hoo, Emily!

413
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,669
Emily, this is such a good chance,
but where did you go?

414
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,719
Hello, Saeba Agency.

415
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,186
Ryo Saeba, right?

416
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,857
I have Emily and your partner.

417
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,125
I'm taking good care of them.

418
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,359
Douglas? What do you want?
I'm taking good care of them.

419
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,259
Douglas? What do you want?

420
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,296
It's simple.

421
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,598
Come to the old Yokohama
Horse Track

422
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,862
at midnight tonight, by yourself.

423
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:21,361
Or the ladies will be blown up like
fireworks decorating the night sky.

424
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

425
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,744
Your traps are waiting
for me, aren't they?

426
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,110
That's Emily's bra!

427
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,387
Wow!

428
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,392
Where are the others?

429
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,189
No! Not here!

430
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,627
Emily wears underwear, doesn't she?

431
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,565
The only thing I can think of

432
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,032
is that someone must have already
stolen her underwear!

433
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,535
This is no good.

434
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,729
I can't do things like this right now.

435
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,225
Off Limits... Yokohama City

436
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,774
Yokohama Horse Track

437
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,961
Kaori, are you all right?

438
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,729
Douglas!

439
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,435
I remember now. Douglas
knocked me out.

440
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,268
When I woke up, we
were already here.

441
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:07,579
Douglas may be using us as
bait to lure Mr. Saeba here,

442
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,046
where his traps are set.

443
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,814
Set for Ryo?

444
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,387
Douglas, where are you?
Come out and show yourself!

445
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,429
Welcome, Saeba.

446
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,765
Don't you think this horse track is a

447
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,134
suitable grave for the
Stud of Shinjuku?

448
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,202
Is your sense of humor the only
thing you're going to show off?

449
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,238
Where are Emily and Kaori?

450
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,796
They are in the tower at the
end of this building.

451
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,543
You can reach them by going
through this building.

452
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,104
Why don't you go and rescue them?
They would be so happy if you did.

453
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,244
But that assumes you can
actually get there.

454
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,823
Somebody's coming!

455
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,299
Dick, you came to rescue us!

456
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,497
He's the man that called earlier!

457
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,537
Boss?

458
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:15,640
I guess you haven't realized yet.
I didn't come here to rescue you.

459
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,248
What do you mean?

460
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,447
I came here to have you killed.

461
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,239
I guess it's started.

462
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,305
I can't believe you're the one who
has been manipulating Douglas.

463
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,552
Wait, my brother was...

464
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,954
You're right.

465
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:00,914
Douglas killed Daniel, but I'm the one
who gave Douglas that mission.

466
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,984
Why? Why did you have
to kill my brother?

467
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,166
Daniel was not only one
of my employees,

468
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,168
he was one of the top
intelligence agents.

469
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,670
He was too good.

470
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,106
He discovered a secret about me that
nobody can be allowed to know.

471
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,168
A secret nobody can be
allowed to know?

472
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,941
Yes. I'm a Yuri.

473
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,913
A Yuri? You?

474
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,111
What a fancy trap!

475
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,750
What a guy! He went through
so many traps so easily!

476
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,623
Well, I guess it's okay, because the
best part hasn't even started yet.

477
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,396
Three.

478
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,002
Four.

479
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,475
Five.

480
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,513
Six! I've got you, Saeba!

481
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,892
I can't believe this.
It's the work of God!

482
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:59,305
Your employer is Dick, the CIA LA
branch manager, isn't he?

483
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,339
You knew that?

484
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,016
As I thought. What's his real story?

485
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,517
Is he a spy for the East?

486
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,984
You're right.

487
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,244
He's a Yuri.

488
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,789
A Yuri?

489
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:12,056
I can't believe that's the only reason
you killed my brother.
A Yuri?

490
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,991
I can't believe that's the only reason
you killed my brother.

491
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,725
Excuse me, but what is a Yuri?

492
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,932
A spy whose parents from the East
entered the country illegally

493
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,067
and passed the mission to their
child who was born there.

494
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,635
I've heard of a similar concept,
called "grass",

495
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,603
that was used by ninja
families in ancient Japan.

496
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:31,609
How does your secret relate
to Ryo being a target?

497
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,976
Do you trust Mr. Saeba's skill?

498
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,238
Of course! Ryo won't lose
to a weirdo like that!

499
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:44,255
I agree with you. I appreciate
City Hunter's skill.

500
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,958
Douglas has become a
hindrance to me now.

501
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,290
His tongue wags too freely.

502
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,120
No way! You targeted Ryo,
so he would kill Douglas?!

503
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:59,300
Are you saying Dick sent me after
you so that you would kill me?

504
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:03,041
There's no other reason he
would choose me as a target.

505
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,711
Don't be so enamoured of yourself!
Are you saying I'm inferior to you?

506
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,306
I don't know. Dick seems
to believe so at least.

507
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:15,876
What confidence. But the game
isn't over yet!

508
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,089
Eat this!

509
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,291
Oh, that's Emily's underwear!

510
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,345
I guess the game is over.

511
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,548
Is Douglas still giving him trouble?

512
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,086
Who do you think you are that
you can say things like that?

513
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,721
You didn't do anything at all!

514
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,985
And Ryo is not a superman.

515
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,494
I can't have that. City Hunter
has to win.

516
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,430
Cooking up this plot was
enough trouble.

517
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,232
I still don't understand.

518
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,667
Why do you need to go to such
lengths to protect yourself?

519
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,302
The only problem is that you're a Yuri.

520
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,793
You'll be safe if you just go
back to your homeland.

521
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,074
I want to keep working
for my homeland.

522
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,377
In order to do so, I have to pull out
the thorn that threatens my work.

523
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,181
No, that's not true. You must
have other reasons.

524
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,752
I'm sorry, but I don't have
time to explain it to you.

525
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,915
I want you to die before
Mr. Saeba gets here.

526
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,260
I'll use your gun to resolve this issue.

527
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,463
If I didn't use your gun
on this occasion,

528
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,431
carrying it would have been
a waste of your time.

529
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:14,736
Don't be angry with me. Both of us
are victims of the intelligence war.

530
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:23,014
It's a cruel thing to love
one's homeland.

531
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:27,280
If you're a man who has betrayed
his homeland and has none.

532
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,419
Ryo!

533
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,153
You bastard!
Ryo!

534
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:29,881
You bastard!

535
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,361
You've betrayed one after the other

536
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,363
until you don't know what's
right or what's wrong.

537
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,627
Your real character is that
of a double agent.

538
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,667
Double agent?!

539
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,271
If you were just a Yuri,

540
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,574
returning to your homeland
would solve everything.

541
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,744
However, if they find out you've
betrayed them as well,

542
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,211
you wouldn't have any place to go.

543
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,816
My guess is that Douglas
was extorting you.

544
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,546
That's why you cooked up this
complicated and ingenious plot.

545
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,821
If you didn't kill Douglas,

546
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:08,224
he would have disclosed the fact
that you are a double agent.

547
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,022
That's the real reason why my
brother was killed, isn't it?

548
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,199
It's also the reason he promoted you.

549
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,360
So he could camouflage his
tracks inside the CIA.

550
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,304
The only mistake you made was
that you chose me as a target.

551
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,111
Who the hell is still over there?

552
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,243
It's a simple trick.

553
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,319
So that's why.

554
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:35,820
I won't forgive you!
So that's why.

555
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,787
I won't forgive you!

556
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,388
Emily!

557
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:43,628
Don't move!

558
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,495
Emily!
Don't move!

559
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,086
Emily!

560
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,298
My homeland?

561
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:52,258
What did his homeland ever do
for a Yuri? Nothing at all!

562
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,940
I achieved my current position
through my own efforts.

563
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,110
Then my homeland suddenly
remembered who I was

564
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,702
and told me it was time to work.

565
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:06,683
I wanted to pay them back. So after I
sold the CIA's information to the East,

566
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,317
I sold the West the information
that I got as a Yuri.

567
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:15,526
It was an easy business for me.
I lived in Beverly Hills.

568
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,929
If Daniel hadn't recognized what I was,
I'd be able to keep earning money.

569
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:23,000
I feel sorry for myself. But I guess
it's about time to quit.

570
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,502
From now on,

571
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,570
I'll use the money I've earned to lead
a life of ease and contentment

572
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,437
where nobody, including you guys,
can reach me.

573
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,050
What's that noise?!

574
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,717
Move, Emily!
What's that noise?!

575
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:40,513
Move, Emily!

576
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,022
What's that?

577
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,591
I won't let you go!

578
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,225
Stop! The jet pack can't
carry two people!

579
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,429
Emily!

580
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,927
Let me go! I'm falling!

581
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,147
Oh good, it looks like she's okay.

582
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,489
Shit! It's Douglas!

583
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,824
Ryo, shoot it down!

584
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:19,990
It's out of range from here.
Ryo, shoot it down!

585
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,158
It's out of range from here.

586
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:21,325
It's out of range from here.
Emily, run!

587
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,883
Emily, run!

588
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,323
Dick, this is your payback for
trying to kill me! You die!

589
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,037
Hurry up, Emily! Shoot!
Shoot it down!

590
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,475
Do it, Emily! Aim!

591
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,813
It's no good! I can't hit it!

592
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,271
Go, go! Blow both of them
into pieces!

593
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,718
Die, Dick!

594
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,554
Saeba!

595
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:59,222
It's too late. It's controlled by an
automatic operating system.

596
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,602
Emily, your mind! Pull the
trigger with your mind!

597
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,505
My mind? Use my mind?

598
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,873
The trigger is pulled by your mind.

599
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:19,545
Yes! Those are the same
words I heard long ago.

600
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,549
Oh no, I can't hit it! Why?

601
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,792
It's no good if you think
about hitting it.

602
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,162
When you pull the trigger with
a calm mind,

603
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,754
you'll hit the target naturally.

604
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,864
Brother...

605
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,588
She did it! She did it!

606
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:13,069
A gun is not a tool for murder.
It's for protecting yourself.

607
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,002
Don't shoot me! Help me!
Please, Emily!

608
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:24,703
You are not worth killing. My gun
would be disgraced if I did so.

609
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,420
You're under arrest on
charges of murder,

610
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,978
conspiracy to commit murder
and espionage.

611
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,126
We did it! The case is over.

612
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,306
However, this wasn't an
official job for the CIA,

613
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,308
so no million dollars
and no nookie.

614
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,775
I'm so sad.

615
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,245
You already paid yourself, didn't you?

616
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,238
What do you mean?

617
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,752
What the hell are these?

618
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,521
You're such a jerk!

619
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:09,790
You stole Emily's underwear while
we were being held hostage!

620
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,288
No, that's not true! Douglas
stole them and...

621
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,959
You still want to make
excuses, even now?!

622
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,565
I'm innocent!

623
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,049
Mr. Saeba, Kaori, thank you very much.

624
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,750
You enabled me to discover the
truth about my brother's death.

625
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,955
After I hand those two over,
my mission is done.

626
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,318
I'm going to go back to my
previous desk assignment.

627
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm sure that my brother would
want me to do that

628
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,467
rather than run around with a gun.

629
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:58,165
Look! A million dollars!

630
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,977
Oh, you got it, did you?

631
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,278
Yes, we did. They paid us in
appreciation for our aid

632
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:01,478
Yes, we did. They paid us in
appreciation for our aid

633
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,047
Yes, we did. They paid us in
appreciation for our aid

634
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,049
in capturing a double
agent and a terrorist.

635
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,953
I guess it includes the fee for
keeping the disgraceful fact

636
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,454
that the CIA let a Yuri inside quiet.

637
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:16,727
You want this, don't you?
If so, meow for me.

638
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,194
Meow...

639
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,295
I'll take this to cover clean-up
of the horse track.

640
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,704
Clean-up? But that place is a ruin!

641
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,839
Since you made such
a big show of it,

642
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,543
we've had to pay huge
amounts of hush money.

643
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,746
Oh, no! I worked so hard!

644
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:42,515
And the only money I get is the
ten thousand dollar deposit.

645
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,948
What are you doing to my check?

646
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,590
You destroyed the shop and didn't
intend to pay for the repairs, did you?

647
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,636
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't pay for it.

648
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,105
Besides, the check is more than that!

649
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,373
You also haven't paid for your
coffee in a long time.

650
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:02,606
Wait a second, Umibozou!
You also haven't paid for your
coffee in a long time.

651
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,437
Wait a second, Umibozou!

652
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:10,014
If you take it away from me, how am I
supposed to live until the next job?

653
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,515
Hey, don't touch me there!

654
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,847
Hey! No! I said don't touch me!

00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:39,809
