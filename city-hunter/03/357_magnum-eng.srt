1
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,528
Driving like a maniac as usual!

2
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,533
You're the one who told
me to hurry up!

3
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,945
You act like you don't want to
participate in this mission.

4
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,572
Don't be stupid!

5
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,923
I guess we made it right on time.

6
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,324
Welcome, Mr. Kilhiman.

7
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,724
We're from the Metropolitan Police
Department. We're here to pick you up.

8
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,330
You're very careful, aren't you?

9
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,365
This is worth a lot of money.

10
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,391
The Metropolitan Police don't have
as much money as you think.

11
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,440
If you don't have the money, why don't
you ask the Japanese government?

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,567
This information is worth it.

13
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,106
There she is!

14
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,117
Hey, I said get away!
Enough is enough!

15
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,151
No pictures today!

16
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:58,618
Grandpa, I'm fine.
No pictures today!

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,487
Grandpa, I'm fine.

18
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,114
You be quiet.

19
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,591
Enough! You can set up a press
conference at the reception tomorrow.

20
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,329
Geez, I wonder if she's an
actress from overseas.

21
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:14,790
She's the virtuoso pianist from West
Gariela, Nina Shutenberg.

22
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,339
Really? I didn't realize that a
globetrotting informant like you

23
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,274
would know so much about the
entertainment industry.

24
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:27,172
It's common knowledge. The Japanese
just aren't culturally aware.

25
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,148
If you say so.

26
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,151
Well, why don't we get going?

27
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,063
Get him!

28
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,799
He's nothing! Just worry
about protecting me!

29
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,037
Kilhiman! Mr. Kilhiman!

30
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,912
What's going on?

31
00:02:58,912 --> 00:02:59,712
What's the matter?

32
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,413
Sounds like someone collapsed!
What's the matter?

33
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:00,947
Sounds like someone collapsed!

34
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:01,214
Sounds like someone collapsed!
Was it a heart attack or something?

35
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,348
Was it a heart attack or something?

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:02,515
Looks like it's an old man.
Was it a heart attack or something?

37
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,716
Looks like it's an old man.

38
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:03,883
Looks like it's an old man.
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:04,951
Oh, my God!

40
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,218
He's bleeding!
Oh, my God!

41
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,019
He's bleeding!

42
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,452
He's bleeding!
Is there a doctor?

43
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,620
Is there a doctor?

44
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,110
Hurry up!

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,762
What the hell?

46
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,232
Are you okay?

47
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,038
Nina! Where are you, Nina?
Where are you?

48
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,591
That was nicely done, Colonel Helzen.

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,069
Save the compliments.

50
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,536
Drive.

51
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,716
Here we go!

52
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,734
Soldier in the night, night

53
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:40,871
Kawa mukou made, kon'ya
futari dekake yoo

54
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:49,687
Tobikiri hayai kuruma mo yooi shite aru

55
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:56,329
Kare no mune ni mimi atere ba

56
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:01,601
Kikoeru heart beat

57
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:06,372
Koko ni itatte nani mo hajimara nai

58
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,975
Ai no hi no

59
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:13,212

00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:17,483
Nanika ni te o nobashi tai

00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:29,162
Kokoro o shime tsuke rare soo na,

62
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,299
Shuumatsu no soldier

63
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,704
Ima, hashi o watatte yuku yo

64
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,641
Akatsuki no mori, ah

00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:51,016
Itsu demo ima dake o ikite itai

66
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,284
Soldier in the night

67
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,399
Hey, did you find any?

68
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:06,566
No, I don't see any.
Hey, did you find any?

69
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,201
No, I don't see any.

70
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,769
You should look more carefully!

71
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,259
I am looking carefully!

72
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,172
You missed some, didn't you?

73
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:13,439
No, I didn't miss any!
You missed some, didn't you?

74
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,633
No, I didn't miss any!

75
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,176
Don't look so depressed.

76
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,711
I'm sure we'll have some
clients tomorrow.

77
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,114
How can you can be so optimistic?

78
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,717
We haven't had a client for
forty-eight days now!

79
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,447
This is a new record for
the Saeba Agency!

80
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,756
What? Is that true?

81
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,316
I wouldn't lie or joke about
something like that!

82
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,363
Congratulations on the new record!

83
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,334
Congratulations on the new record!

84
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,801
Please!

85
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,542
Please come to us, if you have
any problems to solve!


86
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,512
Anything at all is okay!

87
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,279
SAEBA AGENCY - You can trust us!

88
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,748
SAEBA AGENCY - You can trust us!
XYZ is our trademark!
That's the Saeba Agency!

89
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,215
XYZ is our trademark!
That's the Saeba Agency!

90
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,218
Perfect service! Speedy solutions!

91
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,920
You can depend on us!

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,444
Please take one.

93
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,960
This town is developing a
serious litter problem.

94
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,656
Hi, Ryo. Long time no see!

95
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,966
Can I be your client?

96
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,437
Wow, Reika! Of course, I'd do anything
for you! Ask me anything!

97
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,205
No way; you can't.

98
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,341
Oh, why not? I thought you
were looking for clients.

99
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,945
We'll starve before we accept a
request from our competitor.

100
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,980
Oh, what a poor way to put it!

101
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,073
You should call me a "lady in the
same field of business."

102
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,353
Hey, Ryo, I'm so busy it's
making my head swim.

103
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,289
Please help me!

104
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,747
Do you mean you want
me as your partner?

105
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,056
Yes, both physically and mentally.

106
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,298
Wow! I'll have to make a
reservation at a hotel!

107
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,802
Why in the hell did you bring up
a subject like that?

108
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:54,933
It's best if co-workers have intimate
knowledge of each other.

109
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,708
Then how come we haven't done that?

110
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,485
Anyway, I refuse to accept
her as our client!

111
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,975
I'm going home.

112
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:11,491
What? You don't have a relationship
with Kaori yet?

113
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,393
That means I still have a chance.

114
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,054
Call me if you feel like it.

115
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,459
What? You mean for...

116
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,562
No way! But maybe if you help me...

117
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,318
Hi, Umibozou! You look
cute in that outfit!

118
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,621
If you only came here to make
fun of me, you can leave.

119
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,857
I don't think that's a good way to
speak to your customers.

120
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,816
Look at this place! That's why there
are no customers here.

121
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:53,533
Well, I don't care if it tastes bad,
just give me a cup of coffee.

122
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,769
Bad coffee would be a good
match for you.

123
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,760
Gee, What a nice attitude!

124
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,510
What kind of strange customer
would be in a place like this?

125
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,511
It's Kaori.

126
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,012
What? I didn't know she
came here alone.
It's Kaori.

127
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,378
What? I didn't know she
came here alone.

128
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,216
She's still here.

129
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,683
Downstairs with Miki.

130
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:24,230
Wow, all in the center!
Miki, you're incredible!

131
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,697
It's nothing.

132
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,074
Why don't you try, Kaori?

133
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,577
Oh, no, no. I'm not good at shooting.

134
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,536
You look so frustrated, you need
to blow off some steam.

135
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,517
Well then, I'll give it a try.

136
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,654
Here.

137
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:48,888
Thanks.
Here.

138
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,116
Thanks.

139
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,731
Nookie!

140
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,098
Take this, you insensitive sex fiend!
Nookie!

141
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,834
Take this you insensitive sex fiend!

142
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,570
Eat this and die, jerk!

143
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,004
Go to hell, pervert!

144
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,909
She sounds like she's unhappy.

145
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,173
She practices better when
she's unhappy.

146
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,349
Pervert! Molester! Jerk!

147
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,252
I see. She's getting closer
and closer to the target.

148
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,516
Give me the coffee before it gets cold.

149
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,649
National shame of Japan!
Womanizer! Shame on you!

150
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,232
You complain about Kaori, but you
know a lot about her, I guess.

151
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,859
You're the King of Perverts!

152
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,637
Bad coffee, as usual.

153
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,162
Eat this! A punishment from God!

154
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,379
You did it, Kaori! Bulls-eye!

155
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,542
Really? I hit the bulls-eye!

156
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,649
Sexy! Perfect!

157
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,693
How beautiful!

158
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,828
Your beauty is other-wordly.

159
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,598
You came here to see me, didn't you?

160
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,226
Are you Mr. Saeba?

161
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,970
Who are you?

162
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,973
What?

163
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,600
Would you play this tape?

164
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,153
This music is...

165
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,132
I feel better now. Thank
you very much, Miki.

166
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,599
It was nothing.

167
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,868
You're very welcome.

168
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,036
Can I come back again?

169
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:17,369
Sure, anytime.
Can I come back again?

170
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,495
Sure, anytime.

171
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,473
Oh, Ryo, I didn't know you were here.

172
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,441
Long time no see, Mr. Saeba.

173
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,746
Did something happen to Maki?

174
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,840
Maki? You mean the daughter
of Chief Himuro?

175
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:36,088
My name is Nina. I was with Ms. Maki
Himuro in Vienna.

176
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,056
You're Mr. Ljuin, aren't you?

177
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,255
Lju...

178
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,501
That name! I almost forgot
that was his name!

179
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,336
Shut up!

180
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,840
Excuse me, did I say something
I shouldn't have?

181
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,307
Ah, no.

182
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,811
Just call me Umibozou.

183
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:07,078
You're Nina Shutenberg, winner of the
Chopin Competition, aren't you?

184
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:12,525
Yes, I have several concerts in Japan
starting the day after tomorrow,

185
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,493
followed by some in West Gariela.

186
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,166
Maki is at the National Music
School and doing well.

187
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,837
It's famous for its intense practice
regimen, but she's usually cheerful.

188
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:30,242
I've heard that Mr. Umibozou and Mr.
Saeba are private detectives. Are you?

189
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,844
Private detectives?

190
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:35,837
Well, I guess you could call me that.

191
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,108
You didn't come here just to give
us a report on Maki, did you?

192
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:47,126
I talked to Maki, and she told me to ask
Mr. Umibozou and Mr. Saeba.

193
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,458
I have something I need to find.

194
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:56,168
I was told that my father had
died before I was born.

195
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,704
But then I learned that he's still alive.

196
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,073
My mother was also a pianist.

197
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,777
She died five years ago after
a prolonged illness.

198
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,813
Before she passed away,
she told me something.

199
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:12,084
She said, "Your father is alive.
He's in Japan."

200
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,620
But I don't know either his
name or his face.

201
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,390
I asked my grandfather, who is
working as my manager.

202
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,393
All he would tell me is that
my father died.

203
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:27,600
This is the only clue I have to
search for my father with.

204
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,091
This pendant, my mother's keepsake.

205
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,104
"J to S"

206
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,642
"S" stands for Sophia,
my mother's name.

207
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,839
The only clue is a first initial.

208
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,341
I know this is ridiculous.

209
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,518
Leave it to me!

210
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:50,089
There are some people in the
Metropolitan Police who owe me favors.

211
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,092
Finding your father won't
be difficult at all.

212
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,495
Therefore, please wait for the
good news at my office.

213
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,429
Yes, but...

214
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:57,997
Let's go, let's go!
Yes, but...

215
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:58,397
Let's go, let's go!

216
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:58,931
Let's go, let's go!
Hey, Ryo, wait a sec!

217
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,733
Hey, Ryo, wait a sec!

218
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,700
Jerk!

219
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,234
What shall we do, Falcon?
Jerk!

220
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,168
What shall we do, Falcon?

221
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm going. If something happens to Nina,
Maki won't forgive me!

222
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,538
Wow, sounds like fun! I'm going too!

223
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,110
East Galiera Embassy

224
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,281
What is your explanation
for this, Helzen?!

225
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,860
We killed Kilhiman to get this,
but it's all junk!

226
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,295
Ambassador Bondal,

227
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,389
I simply obeyed the order you said
our government gave us.

228
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:37,102
But you told me that Kilhiman might be
selling the police information

229
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,366
regarding our activities in the Far East!

230
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,942
I also told you that I didn't think
a careful man like Kilhiman

231
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,812
would carry the information himself.


232
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,007
But it appears you didn't listen.

233
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,345
But I didn't tell you to kill him.

234
00:15:55,321 --> 00:16:00,192
He set a small but powerful
bomb in a trashcan.

235
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,927
If I had let him live,

236
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,098
he would have claimed it was a
terrorist attack by East Galiera

237
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,431
in order to sell his information
for a higher price.

238
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,095
Did you intend to take
responsibility for that?

239
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,278
If the Metropolitan Police get that
information, you'll be in hot water.

240
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,111
I won't be the only one in trouble!

241
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,184
You don't need to worry about that.

242
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:29,054
The information hasn't reached the
Metropolitan Police Department yet.

243
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,090
What? Where is it then?

244
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,924
Leave things to the Intelligence
Division from now on.

245
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,095
And your Mr. Gunter is, of course,
off the mission.

246
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,242
He's too sure of himself. People call
him the "Crimson Grim Reaper,"

247
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,778
but he's just a murdering machine.

248
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,336
What should we do?

249
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:59,272
I don't want him to take all the credit,
so here's what we'll do.

250
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:05,624
Watch Helzen. Let him find
the information.

251
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,592
We'll complete the plan later.

252
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,734
Colonel Helzen, how was the meeting?

253
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,211
Kilhiman didn't have it.

254
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:31,884
A new ambassador is usually
too eager for success.

255
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,920
Did you find out who
Kilhiman contacted?

256
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,259
Yes, the manager of Nina Shutenberg,
the pianist from West Galiera,

257
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,250
Klaus Shutenberg.

258
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,097
Klaus Shutenberg?!

259
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:49,535
Yes, our personnel are trying to
confirm the information.

260
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,059
We should get their report soon.

261
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,965
I see, Klaus Shutenberg.

262
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,072
Sakuradamon Subway Station

263
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,480
What did you say? Find someone?

264
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,683
I don't have time for that!

265
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,020
I already have one stupid case to deal
with, and it's giving me a headache!

266
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,756
I'm sorry, but NO WAY!

267
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,383
You can't do that!

268
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,895
In that case, I'm going to make
you pay me back right now!

269
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,731
Well, but I'm not feeling well today.

270
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,733
I have an idea! I'll have Reika help you!

271
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,802
She's good at things like that.

272
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,804
No, not that! I meant the work!

273
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,362
Reika?

274
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,410
But she told me that she's
busy as a bee.

275
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,401
Are you sure she'll help me?

276
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,714
Of course!

277
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,750
Hey, will you count this as one of
the nookie points I owe you?

278
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,854
I'll pay you several more of the
nookie points I owe you soon.

279
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,321
Talk to you later.

280
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,690
Did I say something strange?

281
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,326
I hate myself.

282
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,074
Nina!

283
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:02,674
Yes?
Nina!

284
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:02,941
Yes?

285
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,575
Yes?
I promise I'll find your father,

286
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,644
I promise I'll find your father,

287
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,779
so you can relax and spend
the night here.

288
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,682
Don't be silly! Nina is a celebrity!

289
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,018
She's too busy to spend the night here!

290
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,120
Well, actually...

291
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,324
If it's okay with Kaori and Mr. Saeba,
I would like to stay the night.

292
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,592
But...

293
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:20,826
Wow, how wonderful!
But...

294
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,394
Wow, how wonderful!

295
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,597
Now, I have extra energy
to look for your father!

296
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,293
Wow, wow! How lucky I am!

297
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,410
Nina wanted Japanese food for
dinner, so I made these.

298
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,012
I hope you enjoy them.

299
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,916
Wow, tempura and sashimi!
How beautiful!

300
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,351
Kaori, you're a good cook, aren't you?

301
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,581
She's very good at displaying food
that she picked up at the deli.

302
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,623
You have a big mouth, don't you?

303
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,558
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,125
Well, please enjoy your dinner!
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,394
Well, please enjoy your dinner!

306
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,521
Sure! Looks good!

307
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,274
It's good!

308
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:09,675
I'm glad you like it.
It's good!

309
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,176
I'm glad you like it.

310
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,939
Please go ahead and eat
as much as you like.

311
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,620
Another one.

312
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,154
Sure.
Another one.

313
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:22,621
Sure.

314
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,121
Sure.
Hey, you. You shouldn't eat so much.

315
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,657
Hey, you. You shouldn't eat so much.

316
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,594
Doesn't it make you ashamed
to be such a mooch?

317
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:34,266
Oh, really? Saeba hasn't paid
for a meal in years.

318
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,733
Right?

319
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,366
Eat as much as you like, both of you.
Here, Umibozou!

320
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,139
I wonder if I can trust them or not?

321
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,439
Mr. Saeba looks unreliable.

322
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,940
Mr. Umibozou is scary.

323
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,656
Why did Maki introduce me
to people like this?

324
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,790
Ms. Nina?

325
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,157
Yes?
Ms. Nina?

326
00:20:59,157 --> 00:20:59,658
Yes?

327
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,292
Yes?
You can't use chopsticks
very well, can you?

328
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,461
You can't use chopsticks
very well, can you?

329
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,663
I'll teach you how to use them.

330
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,765
Oh, no thank you, that's all right.

331
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,232
Don't be shy!

332
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,627
Wow, oh my God! I'll have
to wipe them off!

333
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,505
Wiping, wiping...

334
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:13,672
Your head isn't a towel, is it?
Wiping, wiping...

335
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,368
Your head isn't a towel, is it?

336
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,514
It might stain. You better change.

337
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,749
But Mr. Saeba is...

338
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,016
Don't worry about Ryo. He's used to it.
We go through this everyday.
But Mr. Saeba is...

339
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,917
Don't worry about Ryo. He's used to it.
We go through this everyday.

340
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,752
Hurry and change.

341
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,419
Sure.
Hurry and change.

342
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,215
Sure.

343
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,065
Is it okay for you to ignore
him in this situation?

344
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,633
Kaori's with her.

345
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,430
Ah, that's true.

346
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,069
Guest Room

347
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,974
Here. These are mine.
I hope they fit you.

348
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,204
Oh, thank you. I'm sure they'll be fine.

349
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,081
The guestroom is right next to my room!
It's now or never!

350
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,752
Wow!

351
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,565
That isn't the only one!

352
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,736
Wow! Cool!

353
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,681
What? What's the matter?

354
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,211
Idiot! What would she have
done if it hit me?!

355
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,724
Do they fit you?

356
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,391
They're fine. A little bigger in the waist,
but the length is perfect.
Do they fit you?

357
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:43,161
They're fine. A little bigger in the waist,
but the length is perfect.

358
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,561
The chest is a little tight though.

359
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,595
Her figure is better than mine.

360
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:53,705
Excuse me, Kaori, can I use
your shower? I feel sticky.

361
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,538
Oh, of course, please!

362
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,577
I wonder if I exercise, if my
breasts will get bigger?

363
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,521
Here. You can use this towel.

364
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,689
Excuse me, but...

365
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,022
Don't worry about Ryo peeking at you.
Excuse me, but...

366
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,491
Don't worry about Ryo peeking at you.

367
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,395
I'll guard the door from outside. Please
feel safe and enjoy your shower.

368
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,862
Thanks!

369
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,663
You're still too easily tricked, Kaori!

370
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,238
It's more tasteful to watch
her through the glass.

371
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,676
But without the glass, I'd enjoy it more.

372
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,564
Ms. Nina!

373
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,160
Why don't you leave your inhibitions
behind with your underwear?

374
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:06,268
How far do you want to go to be the
national shame of Japan, you jerk!

375
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,183
I know you think I have a flat
chest and a big butt.

376
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,685
I'm so sorry!

377
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,054
What are you talking about?
You're not making any sense!

378
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,824
Stay here and cool down for a while!

379
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,021
Ms. Kaori! Please forgive me! I promise
I wouldn't do it again!

380
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,351
It looks like we won't have to worry
about them for a while.

381
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:32,769
Ms. Nina, please help me!
Please let me down!

382
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,484
Kaori, thank you for the shower.

383
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,076
Where did she go?

384
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,868
Momma!

385
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,975
Oh, Kaori.

386
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:15,311
I'm sorry. You looked very much
like my mother from behind.

387
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,885
I've been mistaken for a man before,

388
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,153
but this is the first time I've been
mistaken for someone's mother.

389
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,814
No, that's not what I meant.

390
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,393
Every time I would ask my
mother about my father,

391
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:32,022
she would turn away and
look at the moon.

392
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,905
I'm sure my mother loved
my father very much.

393
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:45,377
There has to be some reason they
had to leave each other.

394
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,412
What am I saying?

395
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,649
It doesn't make any sense that
I mistook you for my mother.

396
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,184
Ah, well...

397
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,888
Kaori, you love Mr. Saeba, don't you?

398
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,658
Don't say such a silly thing! How could
I love a pervert like him?

399
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,717
He's just my business partner.

400
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,463
That must be true. Anything
else is too ridiculous.

401
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,227
Mr. Saeba is so perverted!

402
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,871
You're finally smiling.

403
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,274
What's wrong with me?

404
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:21,446
I don't know why, but when I recall
Mr. Saeba's silly actions,

405
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,471
I can't stop myself from laughing.

406
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:29,654
Even though he seems spontaneous,
his actions are usually planned.

407
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,789
Kaori...

408
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,156
Anyway, I think it would be a good idea
if you didn't sleep here tonight.
Kaori...

409
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,993
Anyway, I think it would be a good idea
if you didn't sleep here tonight.

410
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:39,225
No, I trust Mr. Saeba.

411
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,794
Can you say the same thing
after you see that?

412
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,069
Mr. Saeba?!

413
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,469
Haven't you learned anything yet?!

414
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:58,247
Wasn't that a little much?

415
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,585
There's an old saying in Japan,

416
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,222
"A clever person doesn't
stay close to desire."

417
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,958
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

418
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,323
I'm going back to my hotel tonight!

419
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,107
Police? Did you find Nina?

420
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,175
It's me, Grandfather.

421
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,507
Nina?! Where are you now?

422
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,314
I'm sorry to make you worry about me,

423
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,216
but there's something I had to do
now that I'm in Japan.

424
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,554
What do you mean? There is nothing for
you to do here except the concerts!

425
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,752
I wanted to find my papa.

426
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,925
What?

427
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,663
Nina, you know...

428
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,365
No! I won't let you do things like that!

429
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,933
What are you going to do about
the reception tomorrow?

430
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,703
And the charity concert the
day after tomorrow?!

431
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,339
Don't worry, Grandfather.

432
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,275
I'm on my way to the hotel.

433
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,742
Yes.

434
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:09,143
Find her papa? Idiot!

435
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,982
Just as I thought, we shouldn't
have come to Japan.

436
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,528
Who is it?

437
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:16,895
Room service.
Who is it?

438
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:17,896
Room service.

439
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,063
Room service.
Room service? I didn't order anything
from room service.

440
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,521
Room service? I didn't order anything
from room service.

441
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,597
Who the hell are you?!

442
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:36,247
I had to hide from my grandfather
in order to look for my father.

443
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:40,343
I knew that if Grandfather found out,
he wouldn't let me do it.

444
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:45,590
But now you have to go
back to him like this.

445
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,058
I'm really sorry.

446
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,195
No, it's okay.

447
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:56,334
I know it's impossible to find my
father with no real clues.

448
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,565
But I just couldn't stop myself
from doing something.

449
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,738
Nina...

450
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,612
What are you going to do with me?

451
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,103
I just want you to meet
someone over there.

452
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,549
Someone?

453
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,585
Grandfather, where are you going?

454
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,861
Nina!

455
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,027
Get rid of them!
Nina!

456
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:23,661
Get rid of them!

457
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,362
Get rid of them!
Nina, hurry back to the room!

458
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,829
Nina, hurry back to the room!

459
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,564
Okay.

460
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,860
Wait a second!

461
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,364
I got you! You crook!

462
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,646
Oh, you have a gun, do you?

463
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,113
What a mess.

464
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,018
All right, I guess you'll all have
to come with me then.

465
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,419
I don't think so.

466
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:48,586
What?!
I don't think so.

467
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:49,254
What?!

468
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:49,687
What?!
Ryo!

469
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,755
Mr. Saeba!
Ryo!

470
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,153
Mr. Saeba!

471
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,785
I've got a date with Nina.

472
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,563
So you want to play the knight, do you?

473
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,031
I guess you don't understand
the situation.

474
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,737
If you can shoot me, go
ahead and do it.

475
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,538
What?

476
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,238
Mr. Saeba, don't be ridiculous!
What?

477
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,796
Mr. Saeba, don't be ridiculous!

478
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,384
He's so different from the
Mr. Saeba I saw earlier.

479
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,819
What kind of man is he?

480
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,555
What's wrong? Is that gun
just a decoration?

481
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,022
Shut up!

482
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,050
No way! I already had my gun drawn!


483
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,263
You waste a lot of movement.

484
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,366
Well, I'm guessing you aren't
just an ordinary mugger.

485
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,027
Why don't you tell us why
you're doing this?

486
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,039
Ryo, he's running away!

487
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,506
Don't move!

488
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,379
I'm sorry, Colonel Helzen.

489
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,681
No need for excuses. Go.

490
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:49,881
Yes, Sir.
No need for excuses. Go.

491
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,143
Yes, Sir.

492
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,609
City Hunter and Falcon...

493
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,987
That man...

494
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,523
That was close. You might want to
consider saying thank you.

495
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,192
I didn't need you!

496
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,956
Why are you here anyway?

497
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,565
I couldn't let a wild beast
like you roam free.

498
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,032
What did you say?

499
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,329
You, why the hell are you here?

500
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:53,011
I knew something like
this would happen,

501
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,536
so I hid inside the trunk.

502
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,250
Nina, come with me. We're
going back to the hotel.

503
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,151
Grandfather!

504
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:00,752
Ms. Nina, wait, wait!
Grandfather!

505
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,420
Ms. Nina, wait, wait!

506
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,156
Well, after an incident like this,
it's dangerous!

507
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,646
I'll be your bodyguard!

508
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,899
That man was a professional.

509
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,501
Do you have any idea why
he was after you?

510
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,269
Not at all. Please go home.

511
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,671
Grandfather!

512
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:19,837
After an incident like that,
Grandfather!

513
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,472
After an incident like that,

514
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,303
I'm not going anywhere without
an explanation.

515
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,677
Do whatever you want.

516
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,145
I'm going to bed now.

517
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,612
Grandfather!

518
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,148
You should go to bed soon. You
have a reception tomorrow.

519
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,289
I'm sorry, everybody.
Grandfather is so stubborn.

520
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,484
Well, you don't need to apologize.

521
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,688
By the way, Umibozou...

522
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:48,566
It's not necessary for both of us to
stay here as her bodyguards.

523
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,227
There are two matches here.

524
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,304
The one who pulls the red one
will stay here tonight.

525
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,771
Go ahead and pull.

526
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,311
Oh, you lost.

527
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,846
So I'll stay here tonight.

528
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,148
Let me pull one for you, Ryo!

529
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,217
Oh no! You shouldn't!

530
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,719
Hey, stop!

531
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,381
Oh, sorry. You lost too.

532
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,092
Oh, it broke in my hand!

533
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,328
Why don't we start over again?

534
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,830
Goodnight.

535
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,594
Umibozou and I will take
care of things here.

536
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,334
Yes, Ma'am.

537
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,737
I can't do anything about it, since
you figured out the trick.

538
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,602
I'm going home and to bed.

539
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,198
He's being too obedient.

540
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:39,684
Helzen tried to see Klaus Shutenberg?

541
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,955
When he sees Klaus again,
that will be it, I'm sure.

542
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,223
At that time...

543
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:45,456
Yes, Sir. I know what to do. Trust me.
At that time...

544
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,687
Yes, Sir. I know what to do. Trust me.

545
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,699
RN Private Detective

546
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,130
Why exactly have you come
here to see me, Ryo?

547
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,039
I'd like you to investigate something.

548
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,019
What are they talking about?
I can't hear them.

549
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,823
I promise I'll pay you for this.
I'm not like Saeko.

550
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:22,224
I have no problem with my
cash flow these days.

551
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,661
That's good.

552
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:30,568
Money makes many things possible,
but love makes everything possible.

553
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,002
I'll pay you with love!

554
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,639
Sure.

555
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:41,379
Why don't we go to the bar at the hotel
first to put us in a good mood?

556
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,846
I agree with you.

557
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,217
What?

558
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,118
When you didn't put up a fight,
What?

559
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,719
When you didn't put up a fight,

560
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,778
I knew something like this
would be happening!

561
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:56,059
I just remembered something I
have to do. See you, Ryo!

562
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,666
Ms. Kaori, who is so kind and beautiful,
please let me down.

563
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,396
It's cold out here! I'll freeze to death!

564
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,077
That's disgusting! Wipe it off!

565
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,218
I'm so terribly sorry.

566
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,287
I happened to be hanging around
outside naked all night.

567
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,221
It was your own fault.

568
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,862
Ryo, the parking garage is
underground, isn't it?

569
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,563
Can you park the car?

570
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:36,624
I'm catching a cold, so I want to buy
some medicine before I go inside.

571
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,704
I know I shouldn't trust him,
but I guess I will.

572
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,344
Take your time!

573
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,209
Ms. Nina!

574
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,820
He's an attractive man, but dangerous.

575
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,623
Saeko? Why are you here?

576
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:36,928
My investigation into the murder
of Kilhiman led me to him.

577
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,330
Do you know that man?

578
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,936
Colonel Johann Fredrich Von Helzen,
Intelligence Agency of East Galiera.

579
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,737
He is called the "Crimson Grim Reaper",

580
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:51,075
and people say his skills have
no equal in the East.

581
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,044
In a contest with him, even
you might lose.

582
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,316
I think you're underestimating me badly.

583
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:02,548
There is no way that a perverted middle
aged man is better in bed than me!

584
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,322
What kind of brain circuitry
does that guy have?

585
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,897
What the hell are you doing?
Everybody is waiting for you!

586
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,024
Yes, I'll be right there!

587
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,836
Ms. Nina!

588
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,303
Mr. Saeba!

589
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,377
My grandfather is waiting for me,
so I'll see you later!

590
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,311
You're still here?

591
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,478
I was about to go home.
I'll leave things to you.

592
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,512
Wait a second! Are you going
to leave me like this? Hey!

593
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,280
Ms. Nina Shutenberg Reception

594
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,428
Any time now! What the
hell is she doing?

595
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,454
I don't understand why
women are like this!

596
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,371
Long time, no see.

597
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,506
You, you're Helzen!

598
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:59,043
I would like you to give me the item
that Kilhiman passed to you.

599
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,738
What are you talking about?

600
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:05,616
Klaus, it's totally pointless
for you to keep it.

601
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,886
If you don't do something,
Nina might be in danger.

602
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:12,287
You attacked me last night, and now
you're threatening me like this?

603
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,725
I apologize for our rudeness.

604
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:19,059
If you give it to me, I'll leave
you and Nina alone.

605
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,999
You'll never see my face again.

606
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,302
You're not after Nina then?

607
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,769
Of course not.

608
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,008
I guess I can trust you.

609
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:37,114
When I return to our country, I'll send
it to the East Galiera Embassy.

610
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,107
So hurry up and go. I don't ever
want to see your face again!

611
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,820
You have my word.

612
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,592
Nina!

613
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,564
Are you all right, young lady?

614
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,031
Yes.

615
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,770
I'm sorry. I was careless.

616
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,308
I'm looking forward to your charity
concert tomorrow.

617
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,572
Yes. Thank you.

618
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,153
Such sad eyes.

619
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:20,112
And his touch is so gentle, as though
he were covering me with love...

620
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,598
Excuse me, are you...

621
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,964
Goodbye, Mr. Helzen.

622
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,870
Please excuse me.

623
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,873
Excuse me...

624
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,277
Nina!

625
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,882
What are you doing? Everybody
is waiting to see you!

626
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,018
Grandpa, who was that gentleman?

627
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,487
He's just a fan of yours.

628
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,954
Hurry up and come along!

629
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:56,227
I'm sorry, but please come
with me quietly,

630
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,491
if you don't want to get hurt.

631
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,943
So good! So delicious!

632
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,346
But I wonder where Ryo went?

633
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,914
What?

634
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,682
Both of them are missing?

635
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,051
No way! Look for them again!

636
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,518
Yes, Sir.

637
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,454
What's going on?

638
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,221
Are they missing?
What's going on?

639
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:24,955
Are they missing?

640
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,826
I don't want Ryo taking her
out somewhere!

641
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,029
Hey, can you hold this plate for me?
They're good!

642
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,553
Uh, sure...

643
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,774
Your assassination of Kilhiman
was incredible.

644
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,712
A super-spy with contacts
all over the world,

645
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,616
who can get any job done
for East or West.

646
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,083
That's you, right?

647
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,021
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

648
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,488
Is that so?

649
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,500
This is the bullet that was
removed from Kilhiman.

650
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,697
It was fired from a Nagan
M1895, wasn't it?

651
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:18,709
The 7.62 millimeter Nagan.

652
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,178
In order to prevent loss of velocity,

653
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,948
it uses a special compressed
gas mechanism.

654
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,576
It's very rare nowadays.

655
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,956
If you know that much, why
don't you arrest me?

656
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:35,159
If only you didn't have
diplomatic immunity.

657
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,394
I have a question for you.

658
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,692
Was the bomb also set by you?

659
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,167
It was set by Kilhiman.

660
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,737
He was trying to up his price to the
Metropolitan Police Department.

661
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,373
What? Oh, my God!

662
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:53,677
He was selling his information to the
highest bidder to fund his retirement.

663
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:58,649
He was the kind of guy who didn't care
what methods were involved,

664
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,452
so long as he got what he wanted.

665
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,886
His death was a natural result of that.

666
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,225
Well, should we thank you
for assassinating him,

667
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,490
because there were no fatalities
in the explosion?

668
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,932
By the way, is there any reason
someone would be after you?

669
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,664
Ryo! Stay there! Don't move!

670
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,113
What are you doing?

671
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:32,182
Shut up, idiot! Where did
you take Nina?

672
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,584
The reception area is in chaos!

673
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:33,751
What?!
The reception area is in chaos!

674
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,048
What?!

675
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,887
Ryo, where are you going?

676
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,201
What was that about?

677
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,668
I have no idea.

678
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,042
What are you doing?

679
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,476
I already made a deal with Helzen.
Stop the car!

680
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,681
I want you to be quiet.

681
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,382
If I make a mistake driving,

682
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:09,216
your granddaughter might not ever
be able to play piano again.

683
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,427
That's it.

684
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,314
What the hell?!

685
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:49,685
Helzen!

686
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,225
What? What happened?

687
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,827
Damn! It overheated!

688
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,320
I don't want her to witness
anything unpleasant.

689
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,787
Get out of here!

690
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,754
Causing a car to overheat is
a safe way of stopping it.

691
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,804
Are you hurt?

692
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:46,038
We're okay, but Nina's fainted
from the shock.

693
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,131
Why have the people from East
Galiera been chasing you?

694
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,067
Why don't you ask them?

695
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:13,332
Kilhiman left something
with you, didn't he?

696
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,639
I don't know.

697
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:15,806
It was Helzen who shot Kilhiman.
I don't know.

698
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:19,143
It was Helzen who shot Kilhiman.

699
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:23,514
What? Why do the Japanese police let
someone like him run around free?

700
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:27,217
It's true! Kilhiman left
something with me.

701
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,318
I don't know what it is,

702
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,055
but he told me that the Japanese
police wanted it desperately.

703
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,557
I'll give it to you, if you want!

704
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,923
But in exchange, I want
Helzen put in jail!

705
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,494
Helzen?

706
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,255
Mr. Klaus, where is the
item he gave you?

707
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,868
Only in exchange for the
arrest of Helzen!

708
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:48,038
I'm sorry, but he has
diplomatic immunity.

709
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,573
We can't do anything about him.

710
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,040
Damn!

711
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,043
You're a professional, aren't you?

712
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,645
Please kill him!

713
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,045
If you kill him, I'll pay you
as much as you want.

714
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,384
Do you hate Helzen that much?

715
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,286
Will you kill him or not?!

716
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:06,123
The reason you want Helzen killed has
something to do with Nina, right?

717
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,590
Nina has nothing to do with it!

718
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:12,558
Is that so? Helzen is Nina's
father, isn't he?

719
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,301
I'll never forgive you for saying
a thing like that!

720
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:20,270
Johann Fredrich Von Helzen...

721
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,842
His first name, "Johann", is spelled
J - O - H - A - N - N.

722
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:29,108
Nina's pendant has the
same initial on it.

723
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,514
That's just a coincidence!

724
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:30,981
I wonder?
That's just a coincidence!

725
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:31,970
I wonder?

726
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,116
Reika!

727
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,221
What's going on?

728
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:42,392
Actually, Ryo asked me to
investigate Mr. Helzen.

729
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,162
I wondered why Ryo went to see you.

730
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,130
Well, now you know why.

731
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,834
Johann Fredrich Von Helzen...

732
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,469
Twenty years ago,

733
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,963
he was in West Galiera as an adjutant
to the East Galiera Embassy.

734
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:02,246
Nina's mother, Sophia Shutenburg
was also there at that time.

735
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:06,410
Helzen became a big fan and attended
her concerts nightly.

736
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,548
Can you tell us the story now?

737
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,356
That was...

738
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:20,987
Twenty years ago, at a party to promote
peace between East and West Galiera,

739
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,824
We were introduced to
two new diplomats.

740
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,238
Both of them were skilled pianists

741
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,173
and were big fans of my
daughter, Sophia.

742
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:36,880
After a while, my daughter began
an affair with one of them.

743
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,347
That was Helzen.

744
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,717
He used Sophia.

745
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:44,414
He used my daughter to cover
his covert activities.

746
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,160
My daughter was eventually
dumped, of course.

747
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,651
Then, Nina was born.

748
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,034
That man...

749
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,003
That gentleman was my father?

750
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,778
I know.

751
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,580
She will perform at the charity
concert as scheduled.

752
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,548
We won't let you down.

753
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:25,984
I'm powerful today as usual.
Nookie exercise!

754
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,333
1, 2, 3, 4...

755
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,735
5, 6, 7, 8!

756
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,004
1, 2, 3, 4...

757
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,529
5, 6, 7, 8!

758
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,936
This nice view must be nookie!

759
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:44,548
Good morning.

760
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:44,848
Good morning? It's already afternoon.
Good morning.

761
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:48,011
Good morning? It's already afternoon.

762
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,388
You couldn't sleep last night,
could you, Nina?

763
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,855
Your eyes are red.

764
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,419
Is that so?

765
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:01,054
Mr. Saeba, why did my father
leave my mother?

766
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:05,391
Did you hear what we were
talking about last night?

767
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,474
Well, you were bound to
find out eventually.

768
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,376
I guess it's just as well
that you know now.

769
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:17,180
Mr. Saeba, do you think my father
just used my mother?

770
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,918
I can't believe he would have
done something like that.

771
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,954
Have you ever met him?

772
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,890
Yes, I met him at the hotel last night.

773
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,862
That gentleman, I mean my father,
had very gentle eyes,

774
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,998
but they were lonely and almost sad.

775
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,228
I don't really understand why.

776
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,537
Why don't you believe in him?

777
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:45,208
Sometimes, because of his love, a man
must end a relationship with a woman.

778
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,077
I don't like that!

779
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,671
I want to be near the person
I love, just like this!

780
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,219
I'm getting hungry!

781
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,722
I wonder what's for lunch today?

782
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,690
Oops, gotta go!

783
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,965
City Hunter? Just how pathetic are you?

784
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,990
All you did was run away from him!

785
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,969
I'm sorry.

786
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:16,840
You leave me with no other choice.
I guess I'll have to use them.

787
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,307
Ambassador, that's not...

788
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,646
Shut up! You failed, and I know you
don't have any other ideas!

789
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,910
Now go and request their
dispatch right away!

790
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,283
Yes, Sir.

791
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:32,718
Damn it, these people keep
me from being promoted.

792
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,639
It's starting!

793
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,307
It's so dark. What strange weather.

794
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,518
Incredible!

795
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:34,684
Anybody can do this if they practice.
Incredible!

796
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:37,854
Anybody can do this if they practice.

797
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,321
Do you want to try?

798
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:46,229
You look like a different person when
you hold a gun, Mr. Saeba.

799
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,663
You generally look unreliable
and perverted.

800
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:53,300
Don't call me perverted, just say
I'm really into women.

801
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,239
Aren't they the same, a pervert
and a womanizer?

802
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,409
Well, let me think.

803
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,845
It would be nice if I could always
ask questions this easily.

804
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:07,517
I want to ask him why he ended his
relationship with my mother.

805
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,984
I want to see him again.

806
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,988
Why not?

807
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,821
I'll make sure you have the chance to
see him before your concert tour ends.

808
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,061
Really?

809
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:18,228
Yes, I promise.
Really?

810
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,463
Yes, I promise.

811
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,930
So...

812
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,259
Please make a deposit!

813
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,625
There you go, a deposit.

814
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,674
Why do you have that?

815
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,733
Kaori gave it to me.


816
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,643
Damn her!

817
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,348
Go!

818
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:51,728
I'm going!

819
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,295
What's wrong, Mr. Saeba?
I'm going!

820
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,353
What's wrong, Mr. Saeba?

821
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,755
Stay here!

822
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:05,574
Who the hell are you?

823
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,288
Gun shots?!

824
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:24,993
Hold it!

825
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:03,054
I guess we're too much
for these amateurs.

826
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,901
Hold it!

827
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,240
I won't let you get away!

828
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,650
I won't let go even if it kills me!

829
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,390
Kaori!

830
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:38,501
Colonel, Ambassador Bondal seems to
have had a special team dispatched.

831
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,093
How stupid of him.

832
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,931
I'll rescue your grandfather.

833
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,799
Don't worry about him.

834
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:14,738
I'm sorry. Kaori is in danger
because of us.

835
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,973
That's our job.

836
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,676
Every time she's in danger,
you save her.

837
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,837
Kaori is my partner.

838
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,771
I envy her.

839
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,810
Mr. Saeba, please take me with you.

840
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,758
This is my job.

841
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:40,363
And it's your job to make sure the
charity concert is a success.

842
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,830
Right?

843
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:43,967
Yes.

844
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:44,501
But...
Yes.

845
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,568
But...

846
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:49,472
I promised you would get to
see Mr. Helzen again.

847
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,531
I might not be able to keep my promise.

848
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,244
I understand.

849
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,735
Can I borrow your pendant?

850
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,481
Of course.

851
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,987
A microchip, just as I thought.

852
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,129
I didn't know that's where it was.

853
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:13,430
Saeko!
I didn't know that's where it was.

854
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,597
Saeko!

855
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,498
It would be useless if I asked you
to give it to me, wouldn't it?

856
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,560
You won't confess no matter
what we do, will you?

857
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,695
Stop harping on it. I said
I don't know anything.

858
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:52,869
Too bad. It takes a brave girl to hang
onto a helicopter all the way here.

859
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,336
It's time to say goodbye.

860
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,565
Stop, this girl has nothing
to do with me!

861
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,574
Where is it?

862
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,911
Well, it's...

863
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,378
In the pendant.

864
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:09,112
Kilhiman's information is in the pendant
that his granddaughter wears.

865
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,023
Helzen, damn you!
It's a lie! He's a liar!

866
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,226
Then where is it?

867
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:20,094
You jerk! How much must we
suffer to satisfy you?!

868
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,055
Ambassador Bondal, you broke your
promise to me, didn't you?

869
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,897
Your progress on the mission
was too slow.

870
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:32,108
Besides, our forces were tired
of training exercises.

871
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,744
We were looking forward
to an actual mission,

872
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,746
but it was a little disappointing.

873
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:41,150
You shouldn't make light of Saeba,
Lieutenant Laipnitz.

874
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,618
It will come back to haunt you later.

875
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:47,724
What a wimp!

876
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,887
The Crimson Grim Reaper
is just a coward.

877
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,795
This is where the
helicopter landed.

878
00:58:54,197 --> 00:59:00,703
Figures! A European billionaire is
rumored to have started it as a hobby.

879
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,606
It's a posh athletic club
called "Etranger."

880
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:10,213
We suspect East Galiera uses it as a
training camp for their special forces.

881
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,671
Then the Metropolitan Police have
already targeted this place?

882
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:17,687
There is no proof though,
so we can't help you.


883
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,423
It's so inconvenient to belong
to a police organization.

884
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,857
Well, that has nothing to do with me.

885
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:27,453
It might not be necessary, but I'll
keep this pendant for now.

886
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,559
Mr. Saeba, just a minute.

887
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,105
One more thing. Please tell
me one more thing!

888
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:40,303
Why haven't you accepted Kaori?

889
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,250
A woman can love someone
for an entire lifetime,

890
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,218
but I only fall in love every
now and then.

891
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,615
Do you think that's why my
father left my mother?

892
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,925
No, he must have been more
gentle than I am.

893
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,860
The only thing you can do
is believe in him.

894
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,772
Do you intend to keep all
the fun for yourself?

895
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,468
I'm not good at sharing with others.

896
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,744
How greedy!

897
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:14,911
Well, there might be some leftovers,
How greedy!

898
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:19,048
Well, there might be some leftovers,

899
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,084
if you take the part of the driver.

900
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,685
I won't ask too much.

901
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,243
I just haven't been getting
enough exercise lately.

902
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:52,849
Are you satisfied now, Helzen?
Now that you see me suffering?

903
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:58,087
Laipnitz would have made you
confess sooner or later.

904
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,078
What about Nina?

905
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,759
They won't take action
before tomorrow.

906
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:06,320
And we still have a little time before
Mr. Saeba gets here.

907
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,959
What do you mean?

908
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,631
Stop! Dirty old man!

909
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,574
A transmitter, isn't it?

910
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:21,509
Oh, you realized it, didn't you?

911
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,748
Wait! Why did you leave Sophia?

912
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,717
Nina has been suffering terribly!

913
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,709
She's worried that her father might
not have loved her mother.

914
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,357
Did she find out? Who I am?

915
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,824
What's your answer?

916
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,997
I'm waiting for Mr. Saeba to get here.

917
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:45,297
I might be able to explain
about Sophia to him.

918
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,141
Does Nina know?

919
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:55,311
Yes, I guess she eavesdropped
last night.

920
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,006
Oh, my God!

921
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:03,619
If I hadn't taken that thing
from Kilhiman,

922
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,188
this entire incident would never
have happened!

923
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,790
It's all right, don't worry.

924
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,959
I'm sure Ryo will save us.

925
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,426
Why?

926
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:15,832
His name is Saeba, isn't it?
Your partner?

927
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,468
Why do you stay with a guy like him?

928
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:22,837
Someone who's always chasing skirts
and who's always a target?

929
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,507
Well...

930
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:30,780
Why do women choose dangerous
men like him?

931
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,441
I don't understand.

932
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,756
Shinjuku Plaza Hall
Nina Shutenberg
Charity Concert

933
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:06,015
Mr. Saeba, I believe in my father,
my mother and you.

934
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:09,280
I'll let my faith in you carry me
through the concert.

935
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,635
What's going on?

936
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,973
There are two intruders.

937
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,440
Intruders?

938
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,478
I'll give them credit for finding us,

939
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,776
but they are like moths
drawn to a flame.

940
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:41,216
Don't let them leave alive!

941
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,470
You owe me one!

942
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,204
I don't need your help.

943
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,597
Look out!

944
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,257
What a showoff!

945
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,781
Now, we're even.

946
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,097
Haven't you finished them off yet?

947
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,624
No, Sir, they're tougher than expected.
We're taking heavy casualties.

948
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,437
Damn, what jerks!

949
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:15,904
Lieutenant Laipnitz!

950
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,177
Are you sure we're okay? It seems
like we're in trouble.

951
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,880
Don't worry. They may be tough, but
there's still only two of them.

952
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,882
They can't win against us.

953
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,077
I see. I trust you.

954
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,991
It's noisy outside.

955
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,927
It's Ryo! Ryo is here for us!

956
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:39,986
We'll be all right now, Klaus!

957
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:44,300
How can you be so cheerful?

958
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,667
Aren't you scared? Don't you
feel like you're unlucky?

959
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,973
I'm scared.

960
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,776
I'm scared to death.

961
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,178
But I've never felt unlucky.

962
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,875
I believe in him. I believe that
Ryo will rescue me.

963
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,522
Do you want to make Sophia unhappy?

964
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:11,060
She doesn't know anything about your
dirty world full of gun smoke.

965
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,828
All she knows is playing the piano!

966
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:17,566
If you really want her to be happy, stay
out of her life! Disappear now!

967
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:22,230
Listen! If you continue to
see her, I'll kill you!

968
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,403
Was I wrong?

969
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,205
Hey, leave some for me!

970
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,575
Hurry up and go rescue Kaori!

971
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,510
How ridiculous this is!

972
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:05,302
What the hell? The special
forces are losing!

973
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,016
I see.

974
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,391
Colonel Helzen?

975
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,993
You jerk!

976
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,289
Somebody's coming this way.

977
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:33,229
Come out! The place is a mess
because of your colleagues.

978
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,892
Of course! It won't do you any good
to use us as protection.

979
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,825
Then you just die here!

980
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,341
Who is it?

981
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,906
I guess you didn't learn anything.

982
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,151
Ryo! I knew you'd come to save us!

983
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,987
Hold it!

984
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:02,117
If you hurt Kaori, I won't let you live.

985
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,057
It's useless to try and scare me.
Throw the gun away!

986
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:10,399
Klaus!

987
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:10,566
Damn!
Klaus!

988
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,863
Damn!

989
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,310
Since you can't use either
of your hands,

990
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,972
you'd better ask for a transfer to
a job that's all deskwork.

991
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,751
Thank you, you saved me.

992
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,015
It was nothing.

993
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,188
Well, let's hurry up and go.

994
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,655
Yes!

995
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:43,563
It's over. Everything is over now!

996
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,317
I'll blow up everything at once!

997
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,139
The house!

998
01:12:57,139 --> 01:13:00,074
Our stronghold in the Far East is gone!

999
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,786
Helzen, you're all right!

1000
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:13,254
Kill them all! Don't let them
leave here alive!

1001
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,693
What do you want?

1002
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:17,893
I'm looking for an answer.
What do you want?

1003
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,861
I'm looking for an answer.

1004
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:23,699
I loved Sophia.

1005
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:27,465
Because I loved her, I didn't
want her to be unhappy.

1006
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:33,442
I could have taken Sophia with me to
East Galiera. She wanted me to do so.

1007
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:38,812
But I didn't want to drag her into a
world full of blood and gun smoke.

1008
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:45,120
I thought it was best that I leave
her and the baby she was expecting.

1009
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,148
But ever since then, I have
been looking for them.

1010
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:55,230
For Nina, Klaus and Sophia...

1011
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:59,929
Now I don't know whether it was
the right thing to do or not.

1012
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,971
Helzen, that's enough! Please stop.

1013
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:06,742
Everything, it's all my fault.

1014
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:09,044
I was the one who was wrong.

1015
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:11,880
Klaus, it wasn't your fault.

1016
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,550
Even if you hadn't told me to leave,

1017
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,752
I had already made up my
mind to disappear.

1018
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:17,753
Helzen!

1019
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:18,253
Stop! This isn't natural. It's not right!
Helzen!

1020
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,756
Stop! This isn't natural. It's not right!

1021
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:22,223
Ryo, am I wrong?

1022
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,159
I accept.

1023
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,329
Ryo?!

1024
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:30,833
Umibozou will be the witness. All right?

1025
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,300
Fine.

1026
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:48,851
No!

1027
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,445
I don't understand why these two
have to shoot each other!

1028
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:51,112
Ryo!

1029
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,864
Ryo! Ryo!

1030
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,025
Hold on, Ryo!

1031
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,828
I think I'm all right.

1032
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,368
The pendant is broken.

1033
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,562
I guess I should have listened
to my heart.

1034
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:52,471
I envy the two of you.

1035
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,241
Save me!

1036
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,246
Oh, my God, Helzen.

1037
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,433
Colonel Helzen.

1038
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:36,617
Hey, is anybody there?
It's me! Open up!

1039
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:47,190
It appears you made too
much of a mess.

1040
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,798
Who the hell are you?

1041
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:54,462
Oigen, who the hell is this man? He's
in my office without my approval.

1042
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,639
This is Special Investigator Snyder,

1043
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,475
from the National Security Bureau's
Special Investigation Division.

1044
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:02,705
The Special Investigation Division?

1045
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:08,116
You'll be allowed to explain yourself
once we return to our country.

1046
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:13,989
But I think your mistakes will cost you
a trip to the concentration camps.

1047
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,514
The concentration camps?

1048
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,128
Helzen died in the line of duty.

1049
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:31,131
He and I entered the service in the
same year. It's a shame to lose him.

1050
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:38,269
I guess he's in Heaven with Sophia now.
How lucky he is!

1051
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,234
Thank you for everything.

1052
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:00,736
Take care.

1053
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,704
I need to return this to you.

1054
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:07,306
I'm sorry that your mother's pendant
was broken like this.

1055
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:12,948
No, don't worry. I'm glad this pendant
was able to save you, Mr. Saeba.

1056
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,075
Though you're the only one...


1057
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:42,944
There is no room for me to squeeze
between those two.

1058
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,310
This is the best thing I can do.

1059
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:55,824
I just got the report.

1060
01:19:55,824 --> 01:20:00,462
East Galiera has confirmed
the death of Mr. Helzen.

1061
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,929
I see.

1062
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:10,695
Kaori has Mr. Saeba. But me,
I don't have anything now...

1063
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,531
I thought you'd be surprised to see me.

1064
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:40,490
When I regained consciousness,
I was in the hospital.

1065
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,838
But...

1066
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,999
But Mr. Saeba and the others
didn't say anything!

1067
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,843
We didn't intend to trick you.

1068
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:54,407
But we couldn't tell you anything until
East Galiera confirmed my death.

1069
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,753
I'm dead as an intelligence agent.

1070
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:02,018
I can never return to East Galiera.

1071
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:05,293
No, I...

1072
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,751
I just don't understand!
It's too sudden.

1073
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:12,234
We'll have more than enough
time from now on.

1074
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:15,567
Let's bring back the last twenty years.

1075
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,746
I can't believe this! This isn't a dream!

1076
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:27,010
You really are my father.

1077
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,364
Hey, Falcon?

1078
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:46,201
Just who won the duel after all?

1079
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,836
I don't know.

1080
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:51,795
For them winning wasn't
the point of the battle.

1081
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,110
And both of them are disqualified
as professionals.

1082
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:59,740
Besides, I'm the only one
who can beat Ryo.

1083
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,854
Good job, Ryo!

1084
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,656
I would never have come
up an idea like that,

1085
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:12,994
decreasing the powder in bullets so he
could absorb the shock of being shot.

1086
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:15,224
If you had made even a tiny mistake,
he wouldn't be alive.

1087
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,099
It was a very risky bet.

1088
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:22,570
I had to play my part perfectly, or they
might have discovered the trick.

1089
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,037
Ah, I almost forgot.

1090
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:27,342
Here is that microchip
you wanted, Saeko.

1091
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:31,005
Throw it away, please. I don't
need it any more.

1092
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,550
Sorry Ryo.

1093
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:38,353
I made too many mistakes.

1094
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:39,945
I'm disqualified as your partner, aren't I?

1095
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,960
If you hadn't grabbed the helicopter,

1096
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,629
I couldn't have followed it.

1097
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,119
You're obviously qualified
to be my partner.

1098
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:52,399
Ryo...

1099
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:04,105
Mr. Saeba, I have my answer now.

1100
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:09,575
But you need to keep looking for yours.

1101
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:46,321
Tsuki akari nomi kon de iru
