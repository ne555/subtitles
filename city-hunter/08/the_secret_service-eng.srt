1
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,189
I don't believe it!

2
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,740
Come and get it, City Hunter.
I'm waiting.

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,015
Die!

4
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,107
I did it! I killed City Hunter!

5
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:43,458
What the hell is this?!
City Hunter has a partner?!

6
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,903
It takes two to make City Hunter.

00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:10,496

18
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,186
Anna...

19
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,333
Hello, McGuire speaking.

20
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,236
I see you've arrived safely.

21
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:43,377
Now that you're here, you should worry
more about your daughter.

22
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:46,176
How dare you speak to me like that?!

23
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:55,887
This is a horrible situation!
Just horrible!

24
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:21,486
What an innocent, pretty shape!
Nothing beats a natural figure!

25
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:23,888
Hey, Ryo, I have some great
new videos for you!

26
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:27,187
Wow! These don't have the naughty
parts pixellated, do they, Mr. Gen?

27
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:32,263
Your filthy mind needs a nice,
hard scrubbing!

28
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,367
Now we can finally get to work.

29
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:44,807
I love Kaori's energy, but I wish she
didn't always destroy my store.

30
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,640
Can you ever forgive me?

31
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:53,312
Take a look! It's still there!

32
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:58,445
XYZ Urgent! I'll wait for you at
CafÃ© Harenchi, Ryo Arai.

33
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:03,055
I think this guy wants us to protect
his beautiful daughter.

34
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:09,527
He tricked me with the old double
switch. Get back here, Ryo!

35
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,995
Forget it! You won't trick me into this!

36
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,779
Whoa! Mature sexiness!

37
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,654
I like it!

38
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:39,322
It's not often a beautiful woman pursues
me so sweetly and aggressively.

39
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,566
Are you Mr. Saeba?

40
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:46,333
Yes, Ryo Saeba. President
of Saeba Firm.

41
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:51,602
My name is Rosa Martinez. I don't have
much time, so we better go.

42
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,213
Wow! Mature women are so assertive!

43
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:56,680
Oh, yes!

44
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,087
Ryo!

45
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:09,794
Drove off with a beautiful woman! Does
he think he can find his own cases?

46
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,261
I better do something quick!

47
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:18,625
Rosa Martinez, a lovely name.
Perfect for a woman such as you.

48
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,564
And what kind of woman would that be?

49
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:26,277
A rose blooming in a garden, its beauty
and sweet scent transcendent.

50
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:29,940
The other flowers exist only to
decorate your radiance.

51
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:32,817
You certainly have a way
with words, Mr. Saeba.

52
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:36,116
Your beauty has unleashed
the poet within me.

53
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,827
I'm so sorry. I thought
it was an ashtray.

54
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:47,265
Please, be more careful, Rosa!
By the way, where are we going?

55
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,732
There.

56
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,264
The Diet Building?

57
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:59,177
What a great building.

58
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:02,112
I wish the politicians in here were as
majestic as the architecture.

59
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,949
That's James McGuire.

60
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,623
You know him?

61
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:15,081
He's a candidate for the presidency of
the Guinam Republic, isn't he?

62
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,196
He's the leader of the democratic
movement in that country, yes.

63
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:23,156
His chief opponent is a
former military leader.

64
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:27,906
Mr. McGuire used to be an activist
in the anti-government faction.

65
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:31,842
He was imprisoned for sixteen years,
but was released two years ago.

66
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:34,345
If Mr. McGuire should win the election,

67
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,348
the Guinam Republic will finally
be a free country.

68
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:39,317
But if his opponent should win,

69
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,819
the country will continue being
oppressed by the military juntas.

70
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,821
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

71
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,757
Mr. McGuire is your boss and
my new client, isn't he?

72
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,356
Correct. He wants to hire you.

73
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:53,898
I'm sorry, but I do not
accept male clients.

74
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,200
If you don't take this case,
I'll be in serious trouble!

75
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,002
Will you at least talk to him?!

76
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,267
I will. If you spend a hot night
of love with me!

77
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:05,343
Let me go! What are you doing?!

78
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:08,713
I saw him go in here, so he must
be around here somewhere!

79
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,516
Be quiet! Do you have any
idea where you are?!

80
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:15,320
Oh, no! A fine, sexy beauty like you
should never wear culottes!

81
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,020
What are you doing?!
Oh, no! A fine, sexy beauty like you
should never wear culottes!

82
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,554
What are you doing?!

83
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,256
88 centimeters!

84
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,190
Oh, only 82 centimeters?

85
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:21,992
I win.

86
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,689
You are under arrest for harassing
a government officer.

87
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,268
You're a cop?

88
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,702
Secret Service. On your feet.

89
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,273
Ms. Shinjo, it's all right.

90
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:37,909
No, Ms. Rosa, he must be taken in.

91
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,139
He is a personal guest of Mr. McGuire.

92
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:42,513
This overgrown creep?

93
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:42,680
That's right, sweetie.
This overgrown creep?

94
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,215
That's right, sweetie.

95
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:47,218
Though, to be honest, I wouldn't
mind staying like this forever.

96
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:48,820
How did you do that?

97
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,258
What is going on? I got lost in the
conversation back there.

98
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:56,094
An interview, please?

99
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:56,294
We need a statement from Mr. McGuire!
An interview, please?

100
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,196
We need a statement from Mr. McGuire!

101
00:09:58,196 --> 00:09:58,596
We need a statement from Mr. McGuire!
Just a few words, please!

102
00:09:58,596 --> 00:09:59,297
Just a few words, please!

103
00:09:59,297 --> 00:09:59,464
We can't write an article
without more info!
Just a few words, please!

104
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,665
We can't write an article
without more info!

105
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:00,798
Reception Room Seven
We can't write an article
without more info!

106
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:01,799
Reception Room Seven
We can't write an article
without more info!
Please, ask him to speak with us!

107
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,458
Reception Room Seven
Please, ask him to speak with us!

108
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:06,337
I apologize for having you meet
me in this restrictive place,

109
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:08,506
but this is a most urgent matter.

110
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,270
I would like to hire you as
my chief bodyguard.

111
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:15,380
I'm sorry, but I can't. I don't guard men.

112
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,245
Ryo, don't be so rude!

113
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:20,318
I have more than enough bodyguards
looking out for me.

114
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,582
The person you will be protecting
is this woman.

115
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:27,692
This is the Secret Service agent
we just ran into.

116
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:31,253
Anna Shinjo, I need you to keep
a covert eye on her.

117
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,532
Why do you want us to protect
a Secret Service agent?

118
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:36,234
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

119
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:41,900
I received a threat. He told me that
she would be his target.

120
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,843
A father wanting to protect his daughter.
That's understandable.

121
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,311
Don't say stupid things
like that, you idiot!

122
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:53,017
What makes you say that, Mr. Saeba?

123
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:56,145
Her eyes. Ms. Shinjo has your eyes.

124
00:10:56,854 --> 00:11:01,859
And you are asking us to protect a
highly trained Secret Service agent.

125
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:05,556
With these puzzle pieces, my
deduction was fairly easy.

126
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:19,566
Yes, Anna Shinjo is my daughter.

127
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:26,184
My wife, Ruriko, was killed in an
accident eighteen years ago.

128
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:29,187
I was immersed in the daily turmoil of
the anti-government factions,

129
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,052
so I sent Anna to live in Japan.

130
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,548
I was too worried to let
her stay with me.

131
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,427
Soon after that, I was imprisoned.

132
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:40,164
I didn't receive any information about
Anna for sixteen years.

133
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,631
None whatsoever.

134
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,301
I cannot tell you how awful it was

135
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,204
to wait those long years without
any word from my daughter.

136
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:49,662
Finally, I was released from prison
along with the rest of the leaders.

137
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,677
Almost immediately I became a
candidate for the presidency.

138
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,378
I had freedom once again,

139
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:58,610
but the amount of work that needed
to be done became a prison.

140
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,586
Recently, I received a letter from
Anna's maternal grandmother.

141
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:04,851
She told me that Anna had
become a police officer.

142
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,519
The last surprise greeted me
when I arrived here.

143
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,925
I never expected Anna to become a
Secret Service agent assigned to me.

144
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,658
Besides your family, who else knows
that she is your daughter?

145
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:22,462
Anna was never comfortable with
the idea of being my daughter.

146
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:24,942
Her own agency isn't aware
that I am her father.

147
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:28,407
I think that you are the only one
who knows about this now.

148
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,573
The man who made the threat knows.

149
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,584
That is true.

150
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:33,885
So we are not the only
ones who know this.
That is true.

151
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:36,353
So we are not the only
ones who know this.

152
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:38,990
Come in.

153
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,390
Now the woman who knows how to get
men to do her bidding will appear.
Come in.

154
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,383
Now the woman who knows how to get
men to do her bidding will appear.

155
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:46,164
Ryo, is that any way to introduce
me to your friends?

156
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,366
Saeko, what are you doing here?

157
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:53,871
The Secret Service is under my
Special Investigations unit.

158
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,533
That is correct. Detective Nogami
knows about Anna too.

159
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,941
I was as surprised by this
story as you must be.

160
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:03,472
Are you the one who gave our
names to Mr. McGuire?

161
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,484
You must have a sixth sense, Kaori!

162
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:09,044
Will I ever get any gratitude for all
of the work I send your way?

163
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:11,088
Thank...

164
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:11,589
Don't even say it! This woman owes
me more than we owe her!
Thank...

165
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,092
Don't even say it! This woman owes
me more than we owe her!

166
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,583
I've accumulated thirty-two
hot love IOUs!

167
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:19,897
What are you doing?!

168
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:20,198
Ten IOUs should take care
of the referral fee.
What are you doing?!

169
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:22,900
Ten IOUs should take care
of the referral fee.

170
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,101
You are so selfish!

171
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:24,402
Anna Shinjo is a beautiful twenty-four
year-old. Then there's Rosa.
You are so selfish!

172
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:28,105
Anna Shinjo is a beautiful twenty-four
year-old. Then there's Rosa.

173
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,974
You have more than enough nookie
on your hands as it is.

174
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,839
Unless you want to turn down the job?

175
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,346
We'll take it.

176
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:35,847
Mr. McGuire, it appears as if they have
graciously accepted your job!
We'll take it.

177
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:40,716
Mr. McGuire, it appears as if they have
graciously accepted your job!

178
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:46,513
Really? Oh, thank you. You are going
to be my new bodyguards.

179
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:54,092
Why can't we turn down assignments
from Saeko? I blame it on poverty.

180
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:06,570
Hey! Hey!

181
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:12,282
Why can't that idiot take this
job more seriously?!

182
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,853
You have your own car, don't you?
Why do you have to ride with me?

183
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:18,823
Because since you were trained
by the Secret Service,

184
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,826
you're a better driver than anyone else.

185
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,328
I can't believe they let someone
like you be a bodyguard.

186
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:27,398
Eyes on the road! It's dangerous
to look around while driving.

187
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,229
Don't talk to me like that!

188
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,770
Your angry face is even more attractive!

189
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,704
I should make you even angrier.

190
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,639
How's this?

191
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,569
What did you just do?!

192
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,010
Feels good.

193
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,446
Chief, why did you allow this
man to travel with us?

194
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,953
It's out of my hands.
Mr. McGuire hired him.

195
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:52,290
I guess that means he doesn't
trust us, doesn't it?

196
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,091
Calm down, Agent Shinjo.

197
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:56,260
It's of no importance to us what
Mr. McGuire thinks of us.

198
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,820
Our only concern is that he is safe.

199
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,563
I know that!

200
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:06,504
Jim, are you sure you want that
man to be so close to Anna?

201
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:07,505
He's a professional,

202
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:10,007
but in Japan they don't really know
the meaning of the word danger.

203
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,575
I can't trust them.

204
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:18,139
Is that so? Saeba's a good man. He
reminds me of myself at his age.

205
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,599
Saeko, I'm wondering about Anna.

206
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,169
Why keep her relationship to
Mr. McGuire a secret?

207
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:42,239
No one must find out. If they did,
it would be a big story.

208
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:45,209
Then, she would be forced to resign
from the Secret Service.

209
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:50,977
I understand. If Mr. McGuire got hurt,
it would be a huge scandal.

210
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:55,453
Anna became a Secret Service agent
through hard work and skill.

211
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:58,911
I don't want her career to be destroyed
by an irrelevant matter.

212
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:03,487
I understand. Our secrecy
is vitally important.

213
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:06,323
Ms. Anna,

214
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,366
this is my room number!

215
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:12,132
If you have any questions about
bodyguarding, see me any time.

216
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:16,099
I think you'd better check with
your wife about that, right?

217
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,308
Wife?!

218
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:23,874
Don't you realize how important
this mission is, you moron?!

219
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,517
Help me!

220
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:28,619
Get back here, you jerk!

221
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,555
Jim, are you having any second
thoughts about hiring those two?
Get back here, you jerk!

222
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:31,816
Jim, are you having any second
thoughts about hiring those two?

223
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,130
Don't get the wrong idea, Ms. Anna.
Kaori is just my partner.

224
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,598
I'm single and available.

225
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:42,833
I don't care whether you're
married or single!

226
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,994
I don't want to have anything
to do with you!

227
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:50,173
What a grand and peaceful view.

228
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:55,069
It will soon be realized once
you become president.

229
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:01,185
Please don't stand in front of any
un-curtained windows.

230
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:03,320
You can easily become a sniper's
target if you do so.

231
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,890
You are right, of course.
I'll be more careful.

232
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,591
I must be going. If you'll excuse me?

233
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,058
Ms. Shinjo?

234
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,528
Yes, Mr. McGuire?

235
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:15,099
If you can spare the time, would you
have dinner with me this evening?

236
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,262
No, I must prepare for
tomorrow's detail.

237
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:27,210
They sure don't act like father
and daughter, do they?

238
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,249
Relax and get some sleep.

239
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:33,716
Yes, Sir.

240
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,705
Mother...

241
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,476
A change of clothes?

242
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:02,313
Of course, we're going to be stuck
in this hotel for a while.

243
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:04,682
Do you want to wear the same
clothes day after day?

244
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:08,552
Oh, damn! Everything happened so
fast that I completely forgot.

245
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:11,112
I'll run back to the apartment,
and get some clothes.

246
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:17,983
My passion burns bright!
Let the loving start!

247
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,590
Ms. Anna!

248
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:34,109
You shouldn't wrap them like that.
They'll lose their shape.

249
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:38,114
You Peeping Tom nookie pervert!

250
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:41,876
Hey, what about your clothes?

251
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,090
I know you don't change your
clothes for a year!

252
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,892
Anna, are you all right? Yikes!

253
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,359
What?

254
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,295
They're bigger.

255
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,297
I lose.

256
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:59,995
Damn! Get back here, jerk!

257
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,869
What was that exactly?

258
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:06,834
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

259
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:11,270
Since I struck out with Ms. Anna,
I'll set my sights on Ms. Rosa!

260
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,450
Here we go!

261
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:16,719
Empty!

262
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:22,151
Where did you go, Ms. Rosa?

263
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:25,828
That sound!

264
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,633
She's taking a shower!

265
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:33,194
How lovely of her to remember
her promise to me!

266
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,332
Ms. Rosa's bra!

267
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:39,800
Why did I have to be late?

268
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,022
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

269
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,392
My door was locked, wasn't it?

270
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:58,696
A tiny obstacle to our love.

271
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,223
I will apologize for my lateness
by making you very happy.

272
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,058
Well, let's get down to business.

273
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,371
Where did you learn such an incredible
fighting technique?

274
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:17,214
I learned it on the battlefield.

275
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:20,672
I had to fight night and day in the
conflict against the military.

276
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:24,213
I was a rebel activist like Jim.

277
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:28,321
I would run through a hail
of bullets for that man.

278
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,528
You can't even imagine a world
like ours, Mr. Nookie.

279
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,557
She burned me.

280
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,993
But her towel isn't tight enough!

281
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:42,371
What the hell?!

282
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:46,505
You shameless, international ass!

283
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:50,536
This is scaring me! Please forgive me!

284
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,550
Please put me down, Kaori!

285
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:53,951
Forgive me! I'm scared!

286
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:57,154
Now I have time to go home,
and get some clothes.
Forgive me! I'm scared!

287
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:57,415
Now I have time to go home,
and get some clothes.

288
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,848
What are they going to do about
this broken window?

289
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:26,865
Your eyes are so red! Didn't you
get any sleep last night?

290
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,444
I'm not one of those senseless people
who can sleep tied to a log.

291
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:35,251
Oh, you saw that? I'm so embarrassed!

292
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:36,653
Wait! Wait up!

293
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:36,820
What is it now?
Wait! Wait up!

294
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,254
What is it now?

295
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:41,424
The air conditioner in my car
isn't working properly.

296
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:43,359
Can I hitch a ride in your car?

297
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,419
I hate being hot, because
I sweat an awful lot!

298
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:49,365
What is that you're wiping with?

299
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:52,425
What do you mean? Wow!
How did that get here?!

300
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:54,703
Ride in your own car!

301
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:00,140
Hey, don't steal my treasure!

302
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:05,780
Do you mind if I take this back?
This size is hard to find in Japan.

303
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,115
I need to find out what she eats
to get breasts like those.

304
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:19,390
Tokyo Metropolitan
Government Building

305
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:27,303
The new Tokyo Metropolitan
Government Building,

306
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:29,606
the symbol of self-government
and culture.

307
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:32,074
We will observe the administrative
system today.

308
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:36,012
I don't think it will make a very
good model for you.

309
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:37,775
Don't say things like that!

310
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:53,763
Is there a problem?

311
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:54,264
I'm sorry. I left my purse in the car.
Is there a problem?

312
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:56,528
I'm sorry. I left my purse in the car.

313
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:58,424
Let me get it for you.

314
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:01,596
Ms. Anna, where are you going?

315
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,407
Get down!

316
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:13,081
Ryo!

317
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,518
Get the cars underground!
This is an emergency!

318
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:16,985
Anna!

319
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:33,059
City Hunter...

320
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:38,102
The job has become more interesting.

321
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,043
You're okay now.

322
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:40,343
What about Mr. McGuire?!
You're okay now.

323
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:42,004
What about Mr. McGuire?!

324
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:44,681
What were you doing while all
of this was happening?!

325
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,444
You were the target.

326
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:49,118
What did you say?

327
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:50,676
You know what that means, don't you?

328
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,889
So, you were hired to protect me?

329
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:10,573
Jeez! I don't know why a woman has
to buy so much stuff at one time.

330
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:14,510
Because you told me they looked good
on me when I tried them on.

331
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,139
I can't help it. You look good
in everything you put on.

332
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:20,480
Was that a compliment I just heard?

333
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:22,318
Just a fact.

334
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:23,785
Taxi!

335
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:28,590
What is it? Why have you stopped?

336
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:34,229
Dunkirk.

337
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,374
Today, James McGuire, a presidential
candidate in the Guinam Republic,

338
00:25:44,374 --> 00:25:47,477
was shot at by a sniper outside the
Tokyo Metropolitan Government building.

339
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,843
Fortunately, he was unharmed.

340
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,785
What's going on?! Why do
I need a bodyguard?!

341
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:58,754
Mr. McGuire is worried about you!

342
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:02,125
Worried about me? Why is he
worried about me?

343
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,860
You abandoned me for eighteen years!

344
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,396
Don't tell me you suddenly want
to be my father again!

345
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:10,162
You are a target because of me, so I
must arrange for your protection.

346
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,270
My connection to you could get me
thrown out of the Secret Service.

347
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,972
I'm sure that pleases you.

348
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,940
No, I won't let that happen.

349
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:21,844
No one knows that you are
Mr. McGuire's daughter.

350
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:24,180
I made the announcement after
the assassination attempt.

351
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,718
I made it clear that your father
was the intended target.

352
00:26:28,718 --> 00:26:31,585
They have no reason to ask
you to leave the detail.

353
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:33,923
Are you sure, Ms. Nogami?

354
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:35,425
Or perhaps you would like to leave?

355
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,826
Of course not!

356
00:26:36,826 --> 00:26:40,063
If you want to fire someone, fire
that annoying bodyguard!

357
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:43,726
Why? He saved you from that sniper.

358
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,269
I understand that my job

359
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:49,572
may require me to take a bullet for
the person I am protecting!

360
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:52,208
It would be an honor to lose my life
in the performance of my job!

361
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:55,511
No! I must protect you, Anna!

362
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:57,775
I promised your mother
that I would do that!

363
00:26:58,147 --> 00:27:00,950
Why would you care about a promise
you made to Mother?

364
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,417
Murderers don't care about promises!

365
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,984
Anna, what are you saying?

366
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:08,190
You killed my mother!

367
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:24,299
Those two have some serious issues.

368
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,509
Why? Why did you come to Japan?

369
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,847
I wish you had stayed away.

370
00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:42,716
Even though you protect me, your
terrible sin will never wash away.

371
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,128
It was twenty-five years ago.

372
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:53,434
Ruriko came to Guinam with the
International Medical Volunteers.

373
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,502
She was an affectionate nurse,
filled with a sense of justice.

374
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:03,112
Soon, she sensed the corruption
at the heart of our country.

375
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:06,081
That's when she joined the
anti-government faction.

376
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:11,946
We fought together, and we fell in love.
Soon, we were married.

377
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:15,050
Not long afterwards, Ruriko gave
birth to my darling Anna.

378
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:19,892
Life was hard in the trenches of the
anti-government movement.

379
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:24,622
I cannot tell you how much Anna's
smile helped us get through.

380
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:29,765
We enjoyed peaceful days for a time.

381
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:36,179
But one day I had an argument with my
two aides, Pete and Gonzales.

382
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,613
We disagreed about our proposed
plan of action.

383
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:41,543
Things got heated, and they
pulled their guns.

384
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:44,645
My wife tried to protect me, and
she jumped between us.

385
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:46,577
She was shot.

386
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:51,460
It was now a battle, so I pulled
my gun and shot Pete.

387
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,018
They left us.

388
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,659
I immediately ran to my wife.
She was badly hurt.

389
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,263
And at that moment, Anna woke up
and came into the room.

390
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:07,804
She saw me kneeling next to her dying
mother with a gun in my hand.

391
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:10,971
Anna was only six years old.

392
00:29:12,014 --> 00:29:16,348
She assumed that her father had
murdered her mother.

393
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,683
What a terrible image. I suppose it must
have wounded Anna's heart.

394
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:38,674
Bourbon.

395
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:39,308
Yes, Sir.
Bourbon.

396
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:39,609
Yes, Sir.

397
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:40,176
Yes, Sir.
A story that's too painful to hear again?

398
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:42,576
A story that's too painful to hear again?

399
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:50,575
It was a tragic incident.
Pete was very dear to me.

400
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,780
I was only eighteen years old, and he
always treated me so sweetly.

401
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:58,794
What happened to Pete?

402
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:01,692
He died as they retreated.

403
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:04,634
Then, why did you become
Mr. McGuire's assistant?

404
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:08,798
I invested my youth in the struggle
against our government.

405
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:11,607
The struggle will soon be over.

406
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,973
It's only natural for me to want to be
present at the final victory.

407
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,169
So, it's not a good time to allow
your true feelings out.

408
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:23,714
I suppose, but there is another reason.

409
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,488
I need to test Jim.

410
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:31,389
I want to make sure that he is the
proper man for the presidency.

411
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:33,354
Have you come to a conclusion?

412
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,822
Not yet.

413
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:37,966
I see.

414
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:43,361
Good night, Rosa.

415
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:46,870
Wait. You haven't asked me for
nookie tonight, have you?

416
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,279
I don't want to intrude on your youth.

417
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,281
We'll have plenty of time for love after
you've reached your conclusion.

418
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,644
Thirty kilos of cocaine,

419
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:25,410
and there's plenty more where
that came from, Mr. Hikage.

420
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:31,213
I look forward to a long-lasting
relationship with you, Gonzales.

421
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:35,753
Good! I'll throw in an extra 10%
free as a celebratory gift.

422
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:38,127
My, how generous of you!

423
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:40,763
But there's a Japanese adage: Nothing's
more expensive than what is free.

424
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:44,100
Well, there is something
you can do for me.

425
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,902
Japan is such an inconvenient
country for foreigners.

426
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:49,405
We are so easy to spot among
your native people.

427
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:52,670
I see. Well, of course.
Tell me what you need.

428
00:32:00,216 --> 00:32:02,718
They said you failed to kill him.

429
00:32:02,718 --> 00:32:07,123
Yes. There was interference.
Someone called City Hunter.

430
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:09,825
What?! Did you say "City Hunter"?

431
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:13,022
That McGuire is such a pest!

432
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:18,029
Don't worry, Mr. Gonzales. I will
finish off this City Hunter.

433
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:22,226
Oh, really? Thank you! There's a bonus
in it for you if you succeed!

434
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:27,043
I don't need that. I'll get
something better.

435
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:28,704
Better?!

436
00:32:31,013 --> 00:32:34,779
I will be Number One in the
global underworld.

437
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:44,326
This is famous. It was fired from
a gun called the Trumpet.

438
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:46,162
It belongs to Dunkirk.

439
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:47,430
Dunkirk?

440
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,663
He's a professional killer who's been
making a name for himself lately.
Dunkirk?

441
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:50,132
He's a professional killer who's been
making a name for himself lately.

442
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:52,334
He's particular about neither his
clients nor his methods.

443
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:54,495
He doesn't care much about
his work, either.

444
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,873
He only cares about building
his fame in the underworld.

445
00:32:57,873 --> 00:32:59,809
Be very careful, Ryo.

446
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,045
Dunkirk is focused on being the number
one criminal in the world.

447
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:04,947
But who hired this Dunkirk?

448
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:06,549
Gonzales.

449
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,650
Gonzales?

450
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,050
He's the head of the major drug
cartel in the Guinam Republic.
Gonzales?

451
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,320
He's the head of the major drug
cartel in the Guinam Republic.

452
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,825
He's in Japan to do some business
with Hikage from the Ryujin-Kai.

453
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:19,989
All the information you need is
right here in this videotape.

454
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:22,765
Thank you, Mr. Gen. I appreciate
your constant support.

455
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:24,900
Think nothing of it. So long.

456
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,595
Wait a minute, one more thing.

457
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:28,930
Something important?

458
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:30,933
Do you have any good,
sexy videos for me?

459
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:34,970
Are you all right, Mr. Gen?

460
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:38,273
I'm just fine, Ryo!

461
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:50,126
So, today we get to visit a grade school
and an automobile plant?

462
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:53,994
No, the itinerary was changed to a
hospital and a welfare facility.

463
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,265
A hospital? That should be a lot of fun.

464
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,099
I just know there's going to
be some trouble today.

465
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:08,507
But Chief, why did you let him
change the travel schedule?

466
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:12,181
Mr. McGuire insisted on
visiting these places.

467
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,883
He is a towering historical figure.

468
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:16,919
He is a man of greater character
than politicians usually are.

469
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,547
You give him too much credit.

470
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:24,415
This is just another campaign stunt
to carry the public's favor.

471
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,661
Shinjo!

472
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:26,162
I apologize. It was wrong for
me to say such a thing.
Shinjo!

473
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:29,529
I apologize. It was wrong for
me to say such a thing.

474
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:35,328
Inari General Hospital

475
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,448
Hey! How are you?

476
00:34:46,749 --> 00:34:48,918
Stop fooling around, Mr. Saeba!

477
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,486
You're interfering with the performance
of my sworn duty.

478
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:53,289
Ms. Anna, I'm afraid that you don't
enjoy your work enough,

479
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:55,191
and never find the time to relax.

480
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:58,752
How can you be so insincere
all of the time?

481
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:02,953
I could teach you how to relax in a
cordial, sexual, and gentle manner!

482
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,800
You nimrod!

483
00:35:06,502 --> 00:35:07,992
What an ass!

484
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:10,663
You will wait for us out here.

485
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:13,368
You are barred from entering
the building.

486
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:18,480
Be that way! You want to treat
me like a bad dog?

487
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,675
Then I'm going to act like a bad
dog while I'm out here.

488
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:23,285
This is our intensive care unit.

489
00:35:23,285 --> 00:35:27,656
We care for critically injured and
terminally ill patients here.

490
00:35:27,656 --> 00:35:31,827
We constantly monitor the patient's
respiratory and cardiac status.

491
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:33,829
In order to do this, we use
special equipment that...

492
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:36,632
Mr. McGuire certainly is interested
in the workings of this place.

493
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:41,296
He hopes to build hospitals like
this one in the Republic.

494
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:43,606
If we had facilities like this,

495
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:46,268
many of our citizens would be saved
from so much misery and death.

496
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:51,747
I hope you win, Mr. McGuire.

497
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:53,382
Thank you.

498
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:55,851
Stand back! Please do not
get in our way!

499
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:56,852
Hello!

500
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:57,353
Excuse me.
Hello!

501
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:58,320
Excuse me.

502
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,385
Sorry, I have to examine these.

503
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:03,591
Watch out!

504
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,927
Hold it right there!

505
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:09,021
What? It's just a child.

506
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:14,026
She scared me!

507
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:20,075
You got a little surprise there,
didn't you? I'm sorry.

508
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:23,044
But, hey, don't embarrass yourself
by crying in front of everybody.

509
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:26,110
I'm fine. Don't make a big fuss.

510
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,380
Let's go play over there.

511
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:31,787
What's wrong with you? You're usually
more careful than that.

512
00:36:31,787 --> 00:36:34,449
Go outside and patrol the perimeter.

513
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,791
Chief!

514
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:36,191
That is an order.
Chief!

515
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:37,249
That is an order.

516
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,827
Yes, Sir.

517
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:14,330
I heard about your mother.
She was a nurse, wasn't she?

518
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,797
Yes, she was.

519
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:21,495
Looking at these nurses
made me think of her.

520
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:24,006
The white uniforms are nice,
don't you think?

521
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:28,966
Perhaps, but someone outside likes
them for a different reason.

522
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:30,646
I'll make a bad girl out of you!

523
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:32,348
Help me!
I'll make a bad girl out of you!

524
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:32,548
I'll make a bad girl out of you!

525
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:33,916
That jerk! I'll fix him for good!
I'll make a bad girl out of you!

526
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,009
That jerk! I'll fix him for good!

527
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,021
Those two! What a bizarre
pair they are!

528
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:40,682
Pardon me.

529
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:43,625
Would you take me to the elevator?

530
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,494
I can't hold my bag, and turn the
wheels at the same time.

531
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:48,520
I'm sorry, but I'm on duty. Good day.

532
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:54,391
Well, if it's just to the elevator.

533
00:37:58,707 --> 00:38:00,174
Going down.

534
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:01,876
Yes, he'll take it.

535
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:05,013
Take care.

536
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:06,715
Hey, I'm not taking the elevator!

537
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,183
Oh, I think there's been a slight
change of plans, Agent Shinjo.

538
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:12,485
What the hell is going on here?
What are you...

539
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:24,466
Would you like to get some
coffee with me?

540
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:27,924
You are the love goddess I
have been searching for.

541
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:32,408
Your beautiful skin makes me want to
see it on the rest of your body.

542
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:35,377
Hi, let's spend the night together,
and make love in the morning?

543
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:38,542
Making love in the morning?
What would come next?

544
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,883
After making love, there would
only be love. See you.

545
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:45,911
Don't cover it up! You idiot! Why
did you come here today?

546
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:47,622
I'm dying!

547
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:53,429
Time out! Time out! Ms. Anna
is being kidnapped!

548
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:54,930
I won't fall for that!

549
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,296
Idiot, the van is leaving! Leaving!

550
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,512
Ryo, right there! Three cars ahead!

551
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:47,883
This isn't good for my heart.

552
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,942
Damn, where'd they go?

553
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:59,890
Stairways are not meant for cars,
are they, you moron?

554
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:06,200
Right there! There, Ryo!

555
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,176
Follow us if you can!

556
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:25,050
They're heading out to sea!
We can't follow them!

557
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:27,989
Don't shoot!

558
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,220
You idiot! Now they're both dead,
who's going to steer the boat?

559
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,771
What do you think you're doing?!

560
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:56,011
Hurry up, Ryo! Hurry!

561
00:41:03,325 --> 00:41:05,384
Hey, watch where you're going!

562
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:12,366
He did it!

563
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:31,177
Anna? Anna, are you all right?

564
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:42,390
Father?

565
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:48,828
Anna?! She said "father", didn't she?

566
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:53,440
Despite her protestations, I guess
she really does love her father.

567
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:56,344
Poor thing.

568
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:03,218
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Chief

569
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:04,453
What the hell?

570
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:04,886
What the hell?

571
00:42:04,886 --> 00:42:07,823
Agent Shinjo is McGuire's daughter?

572
00:42:07,823 --> 00:42:09,091
Yes.

573
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:09,324
And you promoted her to the Secret
Service despite this knowledge?
Yes.

574
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:13,729
And you promoted her to the Secret
Service despite this knowledge?

575
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:19,190
No, I found out later.
After Mr. McGuire told me.

576
00:42:21,336 --> 00:42:22,838
What do you intend to do?

577
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:25,507
She will be relieved of her position.

578
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:27,743
No, Sir! She's the best we have.

579
00:42:27,743 --> 00:42:29,244
I am not trying to punish her!

580
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:34,182
The kidnapping has shown us that we
must not expose her to danger.

581
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:35,784
Their relationship has nothing
to do with her job.

582
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:38,120
Or are you making personnel decisions
based on family ties, Dad?

583
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,254
Oh, just shut up, Saeko! I mean,
Detective Nogami!
Or are you making personnel decisions
based on family ties, Dad?

584
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:42,024
Oh, just shut up, Saeko! I mean,
Detective Nogami!

585
00:42:42,024 --> 00:42:44,326
You have to call me "chief"
when you're in my office!

586
00:42:44,326 --> 00:42:46,191
There is no mixing work
with personal life!

587
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:49,986
Ok, Chief. No matter what you say,
I'll make sure she isn't demoted.

588
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:57,533
Are you ready to take the fall if
something bad happens to her?

589
00:42:57,873 --> 00:42:59,875
You mean, would I hand in my
resignation if there were trouble?

590
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,577
I'm afraid the penalty would be
far graver than you think.

591
00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:05,546
You would have to date one of these
guys, and ask him to marry you.

592
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:12,554
Come back here, Saeko!
What do you say? Hey!

593
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:15,557
Talk about mixing work
with personal life.

594
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:20,256
Wait a minute. I wonder who leaked
McGuire's schedule change?

595
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:23,126
The decision to change his itinerary wasn't
made until this morning.

596
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:25,465
Nishi Shinjuku Police Hospital

597
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:31,171
Yes?

598
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,903
Glad to see that you're awake, Anna.

599
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:35,776
I know I didn't ask for permission,

600
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:38,079
but I decided to pick some things up
for you from your apartment.

601
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,740
Here are your clothes.
I'll put them here.

602
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:43,705
They told me that you and
Mr. Saeba saved me today.

603
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:47,221
It was really just a freak accident.

604
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:51,325
We were outside at the time, and
happened to see you carried out.

605
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:54,317
I don't think I'm qualified to be
a Secret Service agent.

606
00:43:55,796 --> 00:44:00,801
How can I protect VIPs?
I can't even protect myself.

607
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:04,760
Wrong! You couldn't have seen it
coming, so it's not your fault!

608
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:07,108
You're very kind to me, Ms. Kaori.

609
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:08,509
It's nothing.

610
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:08,676
It's okay.
It's nothing.

611
00:44:08,676 --> 00:44:09,973
It's okay.

612
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:13,347
I realized it while I was on
duty at the hospital.

613
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:15,713
I can't control my emotions.

614
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:17,718
I could stay on as an agent,

615
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:20,186
but I would end up causing more
trouble than I am worth.

616
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:22,188
Anna...

617
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:24,123
Yes, come in.

618
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:28,857
Anna, you're already sitting up. What a
relief that you're doing so well.

619
00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:32,032
Ms. Nogami, I'm sorry I caused
you so much trouble.

620
00:44:32,032 --> 00:44:34,668
Don't worry about it.
Just get plenty of rest.

621
00:44:34,668 --> 00:44:37,136
Yes. I'll definitely get some rest.

622
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:41,175
Take tomorrow off, and allow
yourself time to feel better.

623
00:44:41,175 --> 00:44:44,872
You'll have your hands full
when you return to work.

624
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:50,618
You mean you want me to continue
to be a Secret Service agent?

625
00:44:50,618 --> 00:44:53,120
We are short of agents right now.

626
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,423
We would be in bad shape if you
decided to resign right now.

627
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:59,792
In any case, we'll have someone
looking out for you at all times.

628
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:03,494
Yes! Do what you like! Give me a
guard, or nookie, or whatever!

629
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:05,431
What did she say?

630
00:45:11,772 --> 00:45:16,644
You persist in your ways. Don't you?

631
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:18,345
That's pretty brave talk.

632
00:45:18,345 --> 00:45:22,406
Why are you so personally
involved in her situation?

633
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,514
She reminds me of myself at her age.

634
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:29,854
I always defied my father, and
performed my job recklessly.

635
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:38,728
Great, there's going to
be another Saeko.

636
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,281
Hurry up! Let's go!

637
00:46:04,425 --> 00:46:07,828
Saeba, why is it so important for me to
escape through the back door?

638
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:10,130
I saw a suspicious person driving
up to the front of the building.

639
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,600
Really? The bad guys have
found out where I am?

640
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,160
If you underestimate the enemy,
it will be the end of you.

641
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:22,776
Damn, I'm too late. I wondered
why he woke up so early.

642
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:25,244
He got Anna out before I got here.

643
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:35,122
A Secret Service agent is out of
breath after such a short run?

644
00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:37,022
Don't you work out?

645
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:39,726
Yes, I belong to a health club.

646
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,197
I'll need to evaluate your lifestyle.

647
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:44,498
Let me observe your daily routine,

648
00:46:44,498 --> 00:46:47,160
and make the recommendations that
will improve your performance.

649
00:46:49,336 --> 00:46:51,497
I get to watch her work out!

650
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,441
What the hell is this?

651
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:58,212
You don't have to expose your
body in order to work out.

652
00:46:58,212 --> 00:47:01,670
But at a health club, don't people
usually wear leotards?

653
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:03,717
You can wear one if you like.

654
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,582
You are so cruel!

655
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:07,353
Damn...

656
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,903
Finished already, Ms. Anna?
What's next?

657
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,653
Where do we go now?

658
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:42,356
We're going to a place where you
can really feast your eyes.

659
00:47:42,356 --> 00:47:44,258
To the swimming pool?

660
00:47:44,258 --> 00:47:45,623
Hojo Museum

661
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:48,890
I didn't expect this.

662
00:47:55,402 --> 00:47:58,462
I can't keep up with her.

663
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:05,813
Is this a naked picture of Saeko?
When did she become a nude model?

664
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:08,281
Please tell me when she
became a nude model!

665
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:18,758
Do you try to bore yourself to
death every single day?

666
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:22,463
If you're bored, you can stop following
me around, can't you?

667
00:48:22,463 --> 00:48:24,965
I just figured it out!
This is your problem!

668
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:28,068
These dowdy clothes are aging
you long before your time.

669
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:30,536
What a waste it is to hide
such a lovely body.

670
00:48:30,804 --> 00:48:33,007
It's just like Detective Nogami said.

671
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:35,542
What did she say about me?

672
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:39,308
She said you reminded her
of herself at your age.

673
00:48:39,913 --> 00:48:42,279
Oh, no. She couldn't mean that.

674
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:46,145
Yep, you're right. She must
have been much sexier.

675
00:48:46,387 --> 00:48:48,622
You don't have to be sexy in order
to carry out your duty.

676
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:49,823
That's where you're wrong.

677
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:54,561
A sexy agent in a mini-skirt draws the
enemy to her as a flower draws a bee.

678
00:48:54,561 --> 00:48:58,065
In the presence of such allure, he is
incapable of thinking straight.

679
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:00,934
Ms. Saeko is very capable,
perhaps even too capable,

680
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:03,630
of using her natural weapons
against men.

681
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:06,269
Don't talk about Ms. Saeko like that!

682
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,042
Bank robbery!

683
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:08,442
Back off, cops! Back away!
Bank robbery!

684
00:49:08,442 --> 00:49:10,000
Back off, cops! Back away!

685
00:49:12,513 --> 00:49:14,148
Release your hostage!

686
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:17,117
Who the hell are you? Back off
before I kill this woman.

687
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:19,453
Stop.

688
00:49:19,453 --> 00:49:19,853
Mr. Saeba?
Stop.

689
00:49:19,853 --> 00:49:20,621
Mr. Saeba?

690
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:20,954
Mr. Saeba?
Innocent people could get hurt.
I'll handle it.

691
00:49:20,954 --> 00:49:23,787
Innocent people could get hurt.
I'll handle it.

692
00:49:24,124 --> 00:49:26,060
Get away from me, big fella!

693
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,662
I'm going to show you something
nice before you're hauled off.

694
00:49:28,662 --> 00:49:29,363
What?

695
00:49:29,363 --> 00:49:30,164
Lookie!
What?

696
00:49:30,164 --> 00:49:30,823
Lookie!

697
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:40,573
Thank you, for showing me paradise.

698
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:43,544
Don't hate me for it.

699
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:47,002
I can't stand seeing a young woman
victimized by someone like you.

700
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:53,875
You see? Most crooks are men.

701
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,092
Idiot! Pervert! Deviant!

702
00:49:58,092 --> 00:49:59,559
Who me?

703
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:01,988
Hey, wait up! Wait up!

704
00:50:02,796 --> 00:50:04,798
Why are you mad at me?

705
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:09,895
You can protect me, but please stay
outside a five meter radius.

706
00:50:10,204 --> 00:50:13,071
Oh, no! Damn...


707
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:24,618
Maybe I was too hard on him.

708
00:50:24,618 --> 00:50:27,451
But he acts so stupidly, he has
it coming, doesn't he?

709
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:39,328
I couldn't wear something like that.

710
00:50:43,837 --> 00:50:45,464
Here they are.

711
00:50:46,373 --> 00:50:48,933
I'm sure they'll look great on you.

712
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:53,175
Mr. Saeba, what do you
think? Mr. Saeba?

713
00:51:03,757 --> 00:51:05,315
It's only natural.

714
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:11,725
Who would want to be with a boring
old woman? A woman like me.

715
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:16,498
Is something wrong?

716
00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:25,479
Hey! Hey, wait for me, Ms. Anna!

717
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:27,881
Were you going to leave me behind?

718
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:30,684
You can hate me, but please
never leave me.

719
00:51:30,684 --> 00:51:32,151
Mr. Saeba, what are those?

720
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,924
These are bras and panties that
will match that new mini-shirt.

721
00:51:36,924 --> 00:51:39,449
I'm going to put them back before
you get mad at me.

722
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:47,331
Thank you, Mr. Saeba.

723
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:06,320
Anna, you bought all of these nice
clothes, why don't you wear them?

724
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,956
It's a waste to buy them,
and not put them on.

725
00:52:08,956 --> 00:52:10,924
I'm glad just to own them.

726
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:14,325
I just wanted to shop. Now, I'm happy.

727
00:52:14,728 --> 00:52:16,864
Yes, but if you don't try on
your new panties,

728
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:19,492
how will you know how good
they look on you?

729
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,706
Cheers!

730
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:38,811
You've saved my life twice, Saeba,
and I still haven't thanked you.

731
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:41,987
Thank you very, very much.

732
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:46,460
You don't have to treat me so
properly like I'm a stranger.

733
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,162
What are you exactly?

734
00:52:49,162 --> 00:52:50,720
Just your bodyguard.

735
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:57,667
I feel differently towards you.
How can I describe it?

736
00:52:57,905 --> 00:53:01,636
You remind me of someone
else that I know.

737
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:06,108
You mean, your father, don't you?

738
00:53:13,553 --> 00:53:19,856
I know why. It's because he serves as a
bodyguard for the Guinam Republic.

739
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,627
Do you really think he is a man
like yourself, Mr. Saeba?

740
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:29,231
It takes more than endangering your life
to make you an honorable man.

741
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:31,036
That's correct.

742
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:34,441
Anyone can put his life on the line,

743
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,877
but one must have a soul in
order to inspire people.

744
00:53:36,877 --> 00:53:38,612
If he didn't have a heart and soul,

745
00:53:38,612 --> 00:53:41,080
he wouldn't have the respect
of his people.

746
00:53:41,882 --> 00:53:44,284
He has neither a heart nor a soul.

747
00:53:44,284 --> 00:53:46,586
The only thing that lives
inside him is vanity.

748
00:53:46,586 --> 00:53:49,077
I don't have one good
memory about him.

749
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:53,584
That's because you have locked
them out of your mind.

750
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:00,389
You should unlock your mind. Then,
those memories would come home.

751
00:54:06,473 --> 00:54:11,240
You should unlock your mind. Then,
those memories would come home.

752
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:56,655
Yes?

753
00:54:58,158 --> 00:55:02,662
You sex hound! What have you been
doing to Anna since the hospital?

754
00:55:02,662 --> 00:55:05,899
Nothing! I'm innocent!

755
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:08,231
Use this opportunity to think about
your personality problems!

756
00:55:11,171 --> 00:55:14,436
It's not fair. Not fair.

757
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:19,935
I'm so tired. I want to sleep
in a bed tonight.

758
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:41,523
I was surprised to find out that
Shinjo is McGuire's daughter.

759
00:55:41,968 --> 00:55:45,199
I'll keep my mouth shut about it.

760
00:55:45,772 --> 00:55:49,208
She's a good agent. Take
care of her, please.

761
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:56,349
I was surprised to see Anna come to
her mother's grave with her father.

762
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:59,019
I wonder if something has changed
her feelings toward him?

763
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:00,587
I don't know.

764
00:56:00,587 --> 00:56:04,148
It's strange. She resented him so much.

765
00:56:08,995 --> 00:56:11,361
You still despise me, don't you?

766
00:56:11,598 --> 00:56:14,032
Not at all. I forgot all about you.

767
00:56:15,068 --> 00:56:16,903
I didn't have a father for eighteen years,

768
00:56:16,903 --> 00:56:19,306
but I kept living during that time.

769
00:56:19,306 --> 00:56:20,967
I guess I got used to it.

770
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:23,042
Anna...

771
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:30,775
I know you didn't kill Mother. You've
lived with that for eighteen years.

772
00:56:31,284 --> 00:56:34,020
But I've lived with my illusion for
the same amount of time.

773
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,284
I think I will always live with that.

774
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:41,583
I can't promise you that I will be
able to accept the truth.

775
00:56:42,496 --> 00:56:44,731
That's why I didn't want to know you.

776
00:56:44,731 --> 00:56:46,699
Because I didn't want to hate you.

777
00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:00,312
There you are!

778
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:03,549
But why?

779
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:07,286
Ms. Rosa!

780
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:11,591
Ryo!

781
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:11,992
Track that helicopter!
Contact our section offices!
Ryo!

782
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:14,460
Track that helicopter!
Contact our section offices!

783
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:24,094
Your puny bullets can't reach
me all the way up here!

784
00:57:24,738 --> 00:57:26,467
He sure likes to make noise.

785
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:38,984
Falcon?

786
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:49,556
Hey, Ryo, was that Umibozu?
What's up?

787
00:57:54,267 --> 00:57:58,533
Damn, he was too fast for me.

788
00:58:00,974 --> 00:58:02,635
I see. Understood.

789
00:58:02,876 --> 00:58:06,073
Ms. Nogami, is there any
information on Ms. Rosa?

790
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:14,020
Her abduction is our fault. We'll do
everything we can to rescue her.

791
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:18,425
Please don't do anything that could
make the situation worse.

792
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:19,892
Please, Mr. McGuire.

793
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,420
Sure, I understand, Detective Nogami.

794
00:58:23,964 --> 00:58:25,765
I must return to headquarters.

795
00:58:25,765 --> 00:58:27,232
Yes, Ma'am.

796
00:58:33,173 --> 00:58:35,869
Ms. Rosa was abducted by
Gonzales, wasn't she?

797
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,005
How do you know that?

798
00:58:39,446 --> 00:58:45,051
You knew that Gonzales was the one
threatening you. You held out on us.

799
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:48,612
It's time you told us everything,
Mr. McGuire.

800
00:58:50,623 --> 00:58:53,888
You must tell us what he's after.

801
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,387
The diamond vein.

802
00:58:57,597 --> 00:59:04,127
If only... If only I hadn't found it,
Ruriko would never have died.

803
00:59:08,074 --> 00:59:14,035
I'll tell you. I was escaping from
government forces in the mountains.

804
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:18,418
The rocky ledge I was standing on
gave way under my feet,

805
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:20,079
and I fell down into a long shaft.

806
00:59:21,554 --> 00:59:25,513
I ended up in a cave deep inside
the Earth, buried in darkness.

807
00:59:26,192 --> 00:59:30,925
That's when I found it, a shiny crystal
that looked like rock candy.

808
00:59:32,065 --> 00:59:35,626
It was a rich vein of diamond ore.

809
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:43,002
I didn't know what to do about it, so
I turned to Pete and Gonzales.

810
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:45,712
They wanted to mine it immediately.

811
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:48,977
They said we could use the money
to fund our movement.

812
00:59:49,582 --> 00:59:51,482
But I didn't agree with them.

813
00:59:51,985 --> 00:59:54,754
I knew that if we started
to mine the vein,

814
00:59:54,754 --> 00:59:56,654
the government officials would
take it away from us.

815
00:59:57,223 --> 00:59:59,559
We couldn't agree on anything.

816
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:03,325
To protect it, I refused to tell them
where the vein was located.

817
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:06,798
They resented me for that.

818
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:11,197
Both of them pulled their guns, then...

819
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:19,510
Awful. My mother is dead because
of a cave full of lousy diamonds?

820
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:23,510
I'm sorry, Anna. It's all my fault.

821
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:28,955
Yes, it is! Mother was sacrificed to
protect your own self-interest.

822
01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:31,458
You might as well have pulled
the trigger yourself.

823
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,026
Anna!

824
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:34,594
Anna, wait!

825
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:36,061
Anna!

826
01:00:42,635 --> 01:00:44,270
Yes.

827
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,238
Gonzalez! Rosa...

828
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:49,775
I see.

829
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,477
What are you going to do?

830
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:57,205
I wanted the diamond mine to be
a source of joy for my people.

831
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,577
That's why I refused to give in
to Gonzales in the past.

832
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:05,749
But I can't allow it to create
any more victims.

833
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:09,922
This is a trick, but I'm sure
you're aware of that.

834
01:01:18,304 --> 01:01:22,400
Rosa has never forgiven
me for Pete's death.

835
01:01:22,842 --> 01:01:25,378
But even though she is probably
in league with Gonzales,

836
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:27,346
I know that she is a loyal patriot.

837
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:30,344
I want her to know that I
trusted that part of her.

838
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:33,286
It is good to believe in someone.

839
01:01:33,286 --> 01:01:36,016
Only great things can come out
of a strong trust like this.

840
01:01:54,207 --> 01:01:57,610
But why me? You never told me
this was part of the plan.

841
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:00,013
Of course not. If anything
had gone wrong,

842
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:03,116
your secret identity would have
been prematurely uncovered.

843
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:07,353
Plus, the presence of the new
bodyguard has changed matters.

844
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:09,821
That is why I altered the plan.

845
01:02:10,223 --> 01:02:14,694
So, you kidnapped me? Well, Jim won't
fall for it. Your plan is flawed.

846
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:19,566
McGuire will come for you, because
of his sense of obligation to you.

847
01:02:19,566 --> 01:02:23,332
He killed your lover, Pete, after all.

848
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:27,407
I know nothing about that. But if he
doesn't come, what do I do?

849
01:02:27,407 --> 01:02:31,366
Then you can return to McGuire
with an innocent heart.

850
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:35,341
I won't do that! I will return to the
Guinam Republic on this ship.

851
01:02:39,152 --> 01:02:42,121
What will you do if McGuire
refuses to show his face?

852
01:02:42,355 --> 01:02:48,316
I will send him Rosa's corpse.
She is of no further use to me.

853
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:54,522
A vein of diamonds is at stake, a prize
requiring extreme measures.

854
01:02:54,767 --> 01:02:59,772
Once I have the diamonds, I want you
to oversee my new enterprise.

855
01:02:59,772 --> 01:03:04,869
I will need new digging machines
made in the factories of Japan.

856
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,637
That will be easy.

857
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:18,450
Can I get you anything?

858
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:21,026
Mr. McGuire?

859
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:24,496
I'm sorry.

860
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:32,028
This exit is secured, Sir.

861
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:48,719
Anna, please go back and talk to
Mr. McGuire. He's your father.

862
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:51,523
He's not my father anymore, and
what business is it of yours?

863
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:54,427
Because I envy you.

864
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:58,386
That's ridiculous. You have no
reason to be envious of me.

865
01:03:58,831 --> 01:04:02,790
At least you still have a parent
who shares your blood.

866
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:04,833
You mean, you don't have...

867
01:04:05,438 --> 01:04:08,574
When I was little, my parents and
my little brother were killed.

868
01:04:08,574 --> 01:04:12,340
They were victims of one of
the large crime families.

869
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:16,738
I can't help but think that you are not
grateful enough for what you have.

870
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:23,988
Kaori, you are very strong, aren't you?

871
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:27,493
You and your father have been
suffering for eighteen years.

872
01:04:27,493 --> 01:04:30,189
Try to reach out to him, so you can
understand each other. Please?!

873
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:34,728
You may have a point there, Kaori.

874
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,831
So, you will try to talk to him?

875
01:04:39,138 --> 01:04:40,799
That's great!

876
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:44,108
Listen... It can't be!

877
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:46,312
Anna, where are you going?

878
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:47,779
Wait!

879
01:04:53,653 --> 01:04:55,314
Stop right there, Mr. McGuire!

880
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:57,590
Don't get involved in this!

881
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,148
I won't let you go.

882
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:03,528
Anna!

883
01:05:17,744 --> 01:05:19,211
Anna...

884
01:05:21,647 --> 01:05:25,208
Well, City Hunter, I'm waiting for you.

885
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:40,955
Miki will worry about you if you
stay out late like this.

886
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,736
Just take me to the place where
the helicopter went.

887
01:05:43,736 --> 01:05:47,536
Hey, is that any way to talk
to me, you big jerk?

888
01:05:48,074 --> 01:05:50,338
Shut your face, and take me there!

889
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:53,079
This is because of Dunkirk, right?

890
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,014
Were you rivals when you were in
that mercenary group together?

891
01:05:55,014 --> 01:05:56,582
I can't excuse his attitude.

892
01:05:56,582 --> 01:06:00,712
He tries to become Number One
without taking me into account.

893
01:06:01,788 --> 01:06:03,255
You'll never change.

894
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:05,992
Ryo, Anna and Mr. McGuire were...

895
01:06:05,992 --> 01:06:07,459
Umibozu!

896
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:12,390
He offered to drive us to the place
where Ms. Anna is being held.

897
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,828
You know where it is?

898
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:27,713
Rosa, I'm relieved to see you alive.

899
01:06:27,713 --> 01:06:29,340
Jim, why did you come here?

900
01:06:29,582 --> 01:06:32,346
Why? In order to rescue you.

901
01:06:32,885 --> 01:06:36,889
Rescue me? I'm a member
of Gonzales's group!

902
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:41,155
I'm the one who told him about
Anna! I leaked your itinerary!

903
01:06:42,261 --> 01:06:44,821
Ms. Rosa... Oh, no.

904
01:06:45,264 --> 01:06:47,800
Don't insult yourself like that.

905
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:52,567
Your feelings for Pete caused you to
make a mistake. Emotions often do.

906
01:06:53,406 --> 01:06:58,070
But you are still my trusted colleague,
and you love the Republic.

907
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:02,014
What a touching scene!

908
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:05,585
Save the niceties for later.

909
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:09,453
We'll start our reunion with you telling
me where the diamonds are.

910
01:07:09,689 --> 01:07:13,955
I will. However, I want you to release
Rosa and Anna immediately.

911
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:18,354
Once I have found the vein, I will
have no need to keep them.

912
01:07:20,032 --> 01:07:27,302
I have found you at last. I've waited for
this moment for eighteen years.

913
01:07:27,773 --> 01:07:30,643
This will all be mine at last.

914
01:07:30,643 --> 01:07:33,976
Lock McGuire and his daughter
in one of the cabins.

915
01:07:34,213 --> 01:07:36,415
Gonzales, you said you'd release her.

916
01:07:36,415 --> 01:07:39,986
Once I know that this map is real, you
will both be set free, Comrade.

917
01:07:39,986 --> 01:07:43,820
Don't call me comrade. You are
the worst of the lowlifes.

918
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:45,791
Move it.

919
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,359
It's a long trip to the Republic.
Make yourselves at home.
Move it.

920
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:49,760
It's a long trip to the Republic.
Make yourselves at home.

921
01:07:56,669 --> 01:08:00,537
Why did you leave Mr. McGuire alone
when you knew what he was planning?

922
01:08:00,773 --> 01:08:03,809
When something stinks, you need
to get rid of it completely.

923
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:05,978
If things continued as they were,
nothing would be solved.

924
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:09,382
But now Anna is in danger
because of this.

925
01:08:09,382 --> 01:08:10,983
Give him a break.

926
01:08:10,983 --> 01:08:13,645
He tried really hard considering he
doesn't have any brains to work with.

927
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,923
Are you trying to praise me or bury me?

928
01:08:16,923 --> 01:08:19,687
I'm just trying to tell it like it is.

929
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:23,930
Wait a minute! Why are we letting
a blind man drive this car?

930
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,031
Oh, yeah.

931
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:25,431
It's part of my new training.
I'm trusting in my sixth sense.
Oh, yeah.

932
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:28,628
It's part of my new training.
I'm trusting in my sixth sense.

933
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,070
Forget that! Give me the steering wheel!

934
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,732
Back off! Don't interfere
with my training!

935
01:08:38,778 --> 01:08:41,338
This room is too nice for the
likes of you, McGuire.

936
01:08:47,687 --> 01:08:48,621
Run, Anna!

937
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:49,188
Look out!
Run, Anna!

938
01:08:49,188 --> 01:08:50,086
Look out!

939
01:08:52,992 --> 01:08:56,894
That was a useless display. The
ship has already left port.

940
01:08:57,863 --> 01:08:59,465
Are you all right?

941
01:08:59,465 --> 01:09:02,025
It's nothing. Don't worry about me.

942
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:06,204
Oh, wait.

943
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:11,711
This! This doll is...

944
01:09:11,711 --> 01:09:14,475
Mother made me this doll
for my sixth birthday.

945
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:17,216
What is this doing here?

946
01:09:17,216 --> 01:09:20,413
I threw this into the bottom of a ravine
during one of our escapes.

947
01:09:21,354 --> 01:09:23,055
I picked it up.

948
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:24,757
Picked it up?

949
01:09:24,757 --> 01:09:27,920
But it would be impossible for you
to get down into that place.

950
01:09:28,494 --> 01:09:31,330
After I was released from
prison two years ago,

951
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:34,094
I went back to the cabin in
which we had hidden out.

952
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:37,637
All I found were the charred remains
of what had been our home.

953
01:09:37,637 --> 01:09:40,940
There was nothing left to remind
me of your mother.

954
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,478
I had sacrificed my family.
I had risked my own life.

955
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:50,245
After all was said and done, there
was nothing for me to return to.

956
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,252
That's what I was thinking.

957
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:55,982
I was so miserable that I was
paralyzed with grief.

958
01:09:56,856 --> 01:10:02,556
I was desperate. I started to drink
heavily. Days became a blur.

959
01:10:03,596 --> 01:10:05,097
Then, one day...

960
01:10:05,097 --> 01:10:09,557
I remembered your doll, and how you
had thrown it into the ravine.

961
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,705
I couldn't stop myself from
doing what I did next.

962
01:10:12,705 --> 01:10:14,673
I climbed down to the
bottom of the ravine.

963
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:17,502
The doll was...

964
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,173
It seemed as if the doll had been
waiting for me to rescue it.

965
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:25,377
It was as if we were meant to be
together even after all that time.

966
01:10:27,486 --> 01:10:34,585
That doll is all that's left from the
one time I was truly happy.

967
01:10:36,262 --> 01:10:39,527
That doll has served as
food for my soul.

968
01:10:40,332 --> 01:10:47,966
That doll has helped me regain the
courage to fight for the Republic.

969
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:51,035
Before that, I only had your mother.

970
01:10:52,812 --> 01:10:55,076
Ruriko's love energized me.

971
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:01,853
I'm sorry.

972
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:05,450
I am so sorry.

973
01:11:06,592 --> 01:11:07,593
Anna...

974
01:11:07,593 --> 01:11:08,094
I am so sorry.
Anna...

975
01:11:08,094 --> 01:11:09,561
I am so sorry.

976
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:14,223
Father!

977
01:11:15,735 --> 01:11:17,202
Anna...

978
01:11:38,924 --> 01:11:41,415
Are you ready, Ryo? If you're
going to do it, do it now.

979
01:11:41,694 --> 01:11:43,829
It sure seems a lot higher
up than I thought

980
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:45,431
when I first came up with the
idea in the first place.

981
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:46,898
Get a move on.

982
01:11:54,873 --> 01:11:57,273
Can't you even try to watch
where you're going?

983
01:11:57,676 --> 01:11:58,911
You're too slow.

984
01:11:58,911 --> 01:11:59,178
That does it! I'm calling you out!
You're too slow.

985
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:01,180
That does it! I'm calling you out!

986
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,114
Who the hell are you?

987
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:02,581
Yikes!
Who the hell are you?

988
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:03,070
Yikes!

989
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:36,814
What's that noise?

990
01:12:37,483 --> 01:12:40,652
Boss, we have intruders.
Two heavily armed guys.

991
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:41,954
Two men?

992
01:12:41,954 --> 01:12:42,154
City Hunter.
Two men?

993
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:43,288
City Hunter.

994
01:12:43,288 --> 01:12:43,455
City Hunter.
Don't worry about them, Mr. Hikage.

995
01:12:43,455 --> 01:12:45,557
Don't worry about them, Mr. Hikage.

996
01:12:45,557 --> 01:12:50,688
What can two annoying little moths
do against our firepower?

997
01:12:50,929 --> 01:12:53,132
I see your point exactly.

998
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:55,567
You two, go up there and help out.

999
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:57,069
Yes, Sir.


1000
01:12:57,069 --> 01:13:02,174
Call Dunkirk so he can enjoy turning
our visitors into fish food.

1001
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:03,641
Yes, Sir.

1002
01:13:46,118 --> 01:13:48,678
What are you doing rolling
in the rubble like that?

1003
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:51,890
Is it my fault that you insist on doing
things in a brutish manner?

1004
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:54,051
My manner is more than proper.

1005
01:13:59,298 --> 01:14:03,268
Falcon, since when did you become
a lackey for City Hunter?

1006
01:14:03,268 --> 01:14:06,138
Shut up! This guy is no friend of mine!

1007
01:14:06,138 --> 01:14:10,006
I don't care. It makes it easier on
me to finish you both off.

1008
01:14:10,342 --> 01:14:14,779
Jeez, this guy really ticks me off.
I'm going to put the hurt on him.

1009
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,443
Don't touch him. He's mine.

1010
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:20,782
Well, you owe me one then.

1011
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:24,181
You are so greedy. Hurry up
and get out of my way.

1012
01:14:33,031 --> 01:14:34,498
Die!

1013
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,882
Would you like a late night snack?

1014
01:14:49,882 --> 01:14:50,916
For us?

1015
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:51,383
But of course.
For us?

1016
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:51,817
But of course.

1017
01:14:51,817 --> 01:14:52,417
But of course.
That's great! We're starving.

1018
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,180
That's great! We're starving.

1019
01:14:57,022 --> 01:14:58,489
Delicious.

1020
01:15:02,995 --> 01:15:04,826
What was that?

1021
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:06,798
Rosa!

1022
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:06,965
Jim, I'm not doing this to
earn your forgiveness.
Rosa!

1023
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,902
Jim, I'm not doing this to
earn your forgiveness.

1024
01:15:09,902 --> 01:15:11,904
I just believe that the future
of the Guinam Republic

1025
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:13,872
depends on the safety of you
and those diamonds.

1026
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,307
Thank you, Rosa.

1027
01:15:16,842 --> 01:15:18,309
Now, hurry up.

1028
01:15:25,117 --> 01:15:26,118
Don't move!

1029
01:15:26,118 --> 01:15:26,618
Ms. Rosa!
Don't move!

1030
01:15:26,618 --> 01:15:27,585
Ms. Rosa!

1031
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:31,122
This way.

1032
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:53,602
Falcon, I didn't expect you to
hold a grudge for this long!

1033
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:55,547
Oh, shut the hell up.

1034
01:15:55,547 --> 01:15:59,210
Do you know how many good men
lost their lives because of you?

1035
01:16:00,085 --> 01:16:02,087
There is no morality for mercenaries.

1036
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:04,214
Those men died because they were
dumb enough to be betrayed.

1037
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:17,668
Damn!

1038
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,639
Do you really think you can beat me
with such a puny weapon?

1039
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:22,197
That does it!

1040
01:16:25,277 --> 01:16:26,744
Die!

1041
01:16:27,346 --> 01:16:28,880
Go to Hell.

1042
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,347
What?

1043
01:16:52,604 --> 01:16:53,305
Damn...

1044
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:54,106
This door is open.
Damn...

1045
01:16:54,106 --> 01:16:54,765
This door is open.

1046
01:17:00,512 --> 01:17:01,979
Where are we?

1047
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:09,921
Rosa, I'm sorry I had pity on you,
and kept you alive this long.

1048
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:13,049
I should have gotten rid of
you like I did Pete.

1049
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:16,094
With Pete? What do you mean by that?

1050
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:20,665
McGuire shot Pete, but it was
only a minor injury.

1051
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:24,294
As we escaped, I decided that it would
be prudent to allow Pete to die.

1052
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:29,434
There was one less person who
knew about the diamonds.

1053
01:17:29,674 --> 01:17:33,879
That's why I told the government
forces where Jim was hiding.

1054
01:17:33,879 --> 01:17:36,439
Their prisons are better than the grave.

1055
01:17:37,249 --> 01:17:39,518
Besides, if he had died
in a stupid battle,

1056
01:17:39,518 --> 01:17:42,180
I would never know where
the diamond vein was.

1057
01:17:43,555 --> 01:17:45,057
You traitor.

1058
01:17:45,057 --> 01:17:46,524
Die, Gonzales!

1059
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:51,596
Go ahead and waste your bullets!

1060
01:17:55,901 --> 01:18:01,669
Oh, my God. I've carried this awful
grudge against you for eighteen years.

1061
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:07,972
How can I... How can I ever
make it up to you?

1062
01:18:11,516 --> 01:18:13,085
Ms. Rosa...

1063
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:17,852
Due to a change in plan, you and
your daughter will have to die.

1064
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,891
If his clients are gone,

1065
01:18:19,891 --> 01:18:23,292
I suppose the bodyguard and his
partner will also leave us alone.

1066
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,054
Mr. Saeba is on board?

1067
01:18:26,298 --> 01:18:29,563
How can you be sure that the map
I gave you is not a fake?

1068
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:32,871
I've known you a very long time.

1069
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:36,739
You are not nearly clever enough
to come up with such a scam.

1070
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:59,131
What's wrong? Why have we stopped?

1071
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:01,133
The engine room has been bombed!

1072
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:03,897
What? Damn those guys!

1073
01:19:05,937 --> 01:19:11,933
McGuire, we need to move things along
now. Have any last words?

1074
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:18,338
I've always believed a personal vendetta
was wrong, but not anymore.

1075
01:19:19,017 --> 01:19:22,888
I only regret that I didn't repay you
for taking Ruriko from us.

1076
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:25,157
He killed my mother?

1077
01:19:25,157 --> 01:19:27,421
Yes, it was Gonzalez.

1078
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:32,863
That man killed my mother.

1079
01:19:34,232 --> 01:19:36,935
It is far too late for regrets.

1080
01:19:36,935 --> 01:19:38,402
Ready!

1081
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,675
Fire!

1082
01:19:46,378 --> 01:19:47,845
Mr. Saeba!

1083
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:55,245
Strike now! He's out of ammo!

1084
01:20:07,299 --> 01:20:08,960
I hate that cretin!

1085
01:20:14,973 --> 01:20:16,565
Anna! Rosa!

1086
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:41,459
This is for my mother!

1087
01:20:44,135 --> 01:20:46,194
Mr. Gonzales, are we okay?

1088
01:20:46,705 --> 01:20:49,674
As a going-away present, let's
fill her full of bullet holes.

1089
01:21:03,555 --> 01:21:05,022
Ms. Rosa!

1090
01:21:07,092 --> 01:21:09,560
Ms. Rosa! Please be okay, Ms. Rosa.

1091
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:12,326
Rosa, you're going to be all right.

1092
01:21:14,366 --> 01:21:17,028
Jim, I'm so sorry.

1093
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:21,266
I have betrayed our homeland.

1094
01:21:21,873 --> 01:21:28,039
What are you talking about? No one
loves our country more than you do.

1095
01:21:30,382 --> 01:21:31,849
Jim...

1096
01:21:34,185 --> 01:21:37,951
Mr. Saeba, I've reached my conclusion.

1097
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:42,258
Would you like to ask me for
some nookie now?

1098
01:21:43,094 --> 01:21:46,359
Of course, it would be my pleasure.

1099
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:49,600
Thank you.

1100
01:21:52,604 --> 01:21:55,540
Ms. Rosa, don't die. Open your eyes!

1101
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,441
Rosa...

1102
01:21:56,441 --> 01:21:57,042
Ms. Rosa!
Rosa...

1103
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:57,974
Ms. Rosa!

1104
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:08,853
It's City Hunter. Let's get
out of here, Gonzales.

1105
01:22:08,853 --> 01:22:10,411
I must kill them all.

1106
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:16,388
I'll finish them off. City Hunter,
McGuire, the girl, all of them.

1107
01:22:18,096 --> 01:22:19,563
Gonzales!

1108
01:22:21,933 --> 01:22:23,696
Don't do it, Umibozu!

1109
01:22:24,803 --> 01:22:26,828
They're mine.

1110
01:22:29,107 --> 01:22:30,768
Now, we're even.

1111
01:22:43,455 --> 01:22:44,922
Mr. Saeba...

1112
01:23:09,514 --> 01:23:10,981
What's happening?

1113
01:23:46,584 --> 01:23:48,787
Thank you for everything,
Detective Nogami.

1114
01:23:48,787 --> 01:23:52,746
Your daughter is now a tenured member
of the Metropolitan Police Force.

1115
01:23:53,191 --> 01:23:57,560
Agent Shinjo, please promise me that
you will visit the Guinam Republic.

1116
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:03,358
Yes, I promise I will be there when you
win the presidential election.

1117
01:24:03,701 --> 01:24:08,263
Agent Shinjo, your assignment as a
Secret Service agent is at an end.

1118
01:24:08,973 --> 01:24:10,475
Ms. Nogami!

1119
01:24:10,475 --> 01:24:12,943
Go back with him, as his daughter.

1120
01:24:20,552 --> 01:24:22,019
Anna...

1121
01:24:23,555 --> 01:24:25,022
Father...

1122
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:43,764
I guess McGuire really wanted Anna with
him when all was said and done.

1123
01:24:44,509 --> 01:24:47,342
All children become
independent one day.

1124
01:24:47,812 --> 01:24:49,314
There's nothing wrong with that,

1125
01:24:49,314 --> 01:24:52,374
as long as their hearts remain
connected to the parents.

1126
01:24:53,852 --> 01:24:57,379
Their hearts remain connected...

1127
01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:06,096
Nothing.

1128
01:25:21,112 --> 01:25:26,277

Koukai no namida dewa

1147
01:28:04,842 --> 01:28:07,311
The Guinam Republic has elected
a new president today.

1148
01:28:07,311 --> 01:28:13,017
James McGuire has sworn to continue
his efforts toward democracy.

1149
01:28:13,017 --> 01:28:16,053
Coincidentally, there was another great
event in the Republic today.

1150
01:28:16,053 --> 01:28:20,992
A rich vein of diamonds was
discovered in the region.

1151
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:24,095
This should help support the
economy of the region,

1152
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:27,064
which has no existing
industry to speak of.

1153
01:28:27,665 --> 01:28:31,624
I'm sure Anna is enjoying having
her father all to herself now.

1154
01:28:32,203 --> 01:28:34,899
I wish I could have Anna all to myself.

1155
01:28:43,814 --> 01:28:47,351
Oh, God! It's Anna! What brings
you back to Japan?

1156
01:28:47,351 --> 01:28:50,980
I came back to work yesterday and
I have a favor to ask of you.

1157
01:28:52,123 --> 01:28:55,126
I don't do anything for free, lady.

1158
01:28:55,126 --> 01:28:57,492
I didn't get any nookie for
the last job as it is.

1159
01:28:58,029 --> 01:29:00,497
Well, this time I will pay
you with interest.

1160
01:29:05,636 --> 01:29:09,504
He really does jump at the bait, just
like Ms. Nogami said he would.

1161
01:29:09,807 --> 01:29:12,674
I have such respect for
you, Ms. Nogami.

1162
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:16,744
Nogami Number Two has just been born.

1163
01:29:17,448 --> 01:29:22,720
We'll meet at the hotel. If you prefer,
we can rent the suite.

1164
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,187
Oh, I don't know...

1165
01:29:25,156 --> 01:29:27,920
What am I supposed to
do now, Ms. Nogami?

1166
01:29:28,292 --> 01:29:31,989
My chance for triple nookie!
We'll take the royal suite!

1167
01:29:32,263 --> 01:29:33,730
Loser!

1168
01:29:42,406 --> 01:29:47,978
This is terrible. Now, I have to keep
an eye out for Saeko and Anna.

1169
01:29:47,978 --> 01:29:49,980
My workload just doubled.

1170
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,141
Double! Double!
