1
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,770
Ladies and Gentlemen,

2
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,872
welcome to tonight's gala reception
celebrating the completion

3
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,941
of the Tokyo Bay City Hotel.

4
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,243
We cannot thank you
enough for coming.

5
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,313
As you know, the Bay City
complex includes this hotel,

6
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,382
an exhibition center and an
amusement park.

7
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,443
All of which will open at the
same time tomorrow.

8
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,398
Damn, I wonder where Ryo is?

9
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,900
Falcon is missing too.

10
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,371
Umibozou is a good man. I'm sure he
had something special to deal with.

11
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,106
I wonder if that's really the case.

12
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,808
Ryo's the one with the problem!

13
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,912
I wonder if he's harassing the
girls in the lobby?

14
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,539
I'm going to go look for him.

15
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,641
Kaori, wait!

16
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,520
The whole city is controlled by the
master computer

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,823
located underneath this hotel.

18
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,926
This computer has full access
not only to Bay City,

19
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,028
but also to the entire world.

20
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,690
This place is truly an international
city of the future.

21
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,597
Wow, sounds incredible!

22
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,941
It was so kind of Miki to invite us.

23
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,670
I wonder why Ryo didn't come?

24
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,247
Where is it?

25
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,277
That's strange. I wonder where
I dropped it?

26
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,413
"Closed today. Please
come back again!"

27
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,291
Damn, the octopus is out too.

28
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,261
I'm screwed! I lost Kaori's memo.

29
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,164
I should have paid attention when
she gave me directions.

30
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:22,123
I'm starving! Somebody tell me
where the party is!

31
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,163
Sexy! Yoo-hoo! What beautiful legs!
They look delicious!

32
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,338
THAT was beautiful!

33
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:37,543
I'm so hungry, and my sexual
power meter is in the red.

34
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:59,663
Well, I would like to toast tomorrow's
Grand Opening.

35
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,510
And afterward, the hotel has some very
special food prepared for you!

36
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,814
Wow, great!

37
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,782
Kaori, those guys never
keep their promises.

38
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,318
Let's forget them, eat as much as we
want and then go home!

39
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,656
Of course! That looks so good!
What is it called? Here you go.

40
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,193
Now, to the future of the
Tokyo Bay City! Cheers!

41
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,683
Cheers!

42
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,069
Hey guys, deliveries need
to go to the back door.

43
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,696
What are you carrying anyway?

44
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,016
Who the hell are you?!

45
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,512
What are you doing?!

46
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:37,536
I have to show some restraint. The
main course hasn't even come yet.

47
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,566
Well, this will have to do for starters.

48
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,709
Hey, Kaori.

49
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,142
What? What's the matter?
Hey, Kaori.

50
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,177
What? What's the matter?

51
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,975
What are you doing with all that food?
Everybody's watching you!

52
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,495
Yoo-hoo! Where are you
going in such a hurry?

53
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,219
How lucky I am to come across
a beautiful lady like you!

54
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,449
Let me go. I'm in a hurry.

55
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,293
Are you running away from someone?

56
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,625
It's all right. I'll help you.

57
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,363
Get out of my way!

58
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,067
What did you do to me?!

59
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:17,937
Umibozou?

60
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,538
I'm going to keep this woman.
Umibozou?

61
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,839
I'm going to keep this woman.

62
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,331
You jerk! I spoke to her first!

63
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,579
Wait a minute, you big monster!

64
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,309
You have Miki, and you're flirting with
another woman? I won't forgive you!

65
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,119
Let me go!

66
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,786
I'm so hungry! I'm going to eat you,
you octopus!
Let me go!

67
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,016
I'm so hungry! I'm going to eat you,
you octopus!

68
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,822
You!

69
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,896
Listen, I'm serious! Back off now!

70
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,264
I see, I understand.

71
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,926
But if I give up and you take her,
you have to take this one too.

72
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,264
C... c... cat!

73
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,711
Wait, what's your response?

74
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,282
Hey, what's the matter? If you
don't take the cat,

75
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,251
you have to give up the girl!

76
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,412
Cut it out! You'll pay for this!

77
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,460
Damn!

78
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,029
Get out of the way!

79
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,698
What are you doing?

80
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,468
Wait!

81
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,234
You, jerk! What are you doing
to my car seat?!

82
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,743
I can't drive with it in my way.

83
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,177
Jerk! This car belongs to me, not you!

84
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,585
Wow, that was so close!

85
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,486
If you don't want to be thrown
off, you better hang on tight!

86
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,063
Idiot! Can't you drive a
little more carefully?

87
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,803
Shut up! Stop complaining or get off!

88
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,431
You jerk, this is my car!

89
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,783
Who the hell are those two?

90
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,953
Falcon and City Hunter. They are
both professional gunmen.

91
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,616
Professional? Has our mission
been compromised, Claude?

92
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,826
Our mission is going perfectly.

93
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,995
Except that they're following
us right now.

94
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,462
What?

95
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,633
Why don't you do something?
Eliminate them right now!

96
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:32,093
Don't worry, General Gilliam. We
have already prepared for them.

97
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,080
This place is...

98
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,567
Hey, do something!

99
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,203
Shut up! Both my hands are busy!

100
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,670
You do something!

101
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,600
If you say so, but what?

102
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,858
The pursuing car has been eliminated.

103
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,860
Good. Close the bridge.

104
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,327
Roger.

105
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,972
I wonder if Umibozou drowned?

106
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:46,434
This is ridiculous! This is too much
to go through for one woman!

107
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,324
Hey, let's eat now while we have time.

108
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,791
Sure.

109
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,129
This is area F5. This is area F5.

110
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:03,629
Damn, there's lots of delicious
food in the hotel.

111
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,291
Everything secure. Over and out.
Damn, there's lots of delicious
food in the hotel.

112
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,101
Thank you for the food!

113
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,442
He stole our food!

114
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,211
Delicious!

115
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,187
What's going on?

116
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:28,688
There is an intruder in area F3.
What's going on?

117
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,087
There is an intruder in area F3.

118
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,726
Intruder? What does the person
look like? Report at once!

119
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,126
Well, he's really hungry.

120
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,128
Idiot! Hurry up and get rid of him!

121
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,832
Roger!

122
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,139
Well, I can start looking for her now.

123
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,606
I found him!

124
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,304
Who the hell are these guys?

125
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,617
I guess the octopus is alive.

126
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,559
This is area F7. A huge guy has
infiltrated the area and is attacking us!

127
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,239
Gomez, we have intruders.
Deal with them.

128
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,706
Yes, Sir.

129
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,006
If we don't do something about it, the
people at the party will notice.

130
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,523
Mr. Chairman, thank you
for inviting us.

131
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,460
Oh no, it's my pleasure. I've enjoyed
visiting your coffeehouse.

132
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,830
By the way, I haven't seen that
big man who works there.

133
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,100
Well, he usually keeps his promises,

134
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,331
but I guess something more
important came up.

135
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,470
Look, Miki! The fireworks are beautiful!

136
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,469
Fireworks? That's strange. There
were no fireworks planned.

137
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,251
We have intruders. Turn on the power.
Get the lights on!

138
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,718
Roger!

139
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,189
That's in area F4, isn't it? Hurry up!

140
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,925
I don't have time to deal with this. I'm
on a mission to get me some!

141
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,496
Don't chase women all the time!

142
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,771
Damn! What do you want?

143
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,640
If you're not too busy,
you could help me.

144
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,700
If you want me to help you, you
have to tell me her name!

145
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,837
Her name? Don't you know
what's going on?

146
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,750
Falcon? Falcon, answer me!

147
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,920
That's Saeko.

148
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,022
Has Saeko hired you?

149
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,489
Shut up!

150
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,227
Falcon, what's going on?
I need a status report.

151
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,639
Hey, does she have something on you?

152
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,907
Shut up!

153
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:35,140
Hey Saeko, I haven't talked
to you in a long time.
Shut up!

154
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,199
Hey Saeko, I haven't talked
to you in a long time.

155
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,444
Is that you, Ryo?

156
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,970
There is nothing to report!

157
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:44,783
The radio!

158
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,484
I'm really busy right now!
The radio!

159
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,473
I'm really busy right now!

160
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,422
Why is Ryo there?

161
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,064
If those aren't fireworks,
what are they then?

162
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,932
I don't know.

163
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:00,566
I'm going to find out.
I don't know.

164
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,396
I'm going to find out.

165
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,975
If anyone resists, they'll be shot
dead without any hesitation.

166
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,603
Everyone move together.
Over there! Now!

167
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,654
Who the hell are you people?

168
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,357
Wow, what a brave girl!

169
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,522
Back off, or I'll shoot!

170
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:34,293
If you want to shoot me, you may do
so, but everyone else will die.

171
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,435
I don't really want to get rough
with you ladies.

172
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,949
How about you, Miss?

173
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,753
I give up!

174
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,483
Hey, hey, Umi-dear!

175
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,357
What kind of dirt does Saeko
have on you?

176
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:05,597
Shut up!

177
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,398
Is there any chance that
you saw Saeko naked?
Shut up!

178
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,162
Is there any chance that
you saw Saeko naked?

179
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,231
That's strange. Why do I feel
dirty all of the sudden?

180
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,641
You jerk!

181
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:15,874
I'm going to tell Miki!
You jerk!

182
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,576
I'm going to tell Miki!

183
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,278
Shut up! I'm going to kill
you right here and now,

184
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,980
so you can't say anything!

185
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,149
If you want me to keep your secret,
tell me her name!

186
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,014
The name of the woman is Luna.

187
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,179
I see. Luna, what a nice name!

188
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,185
Listen to what I'm telling you! She isn't
the kind of woman you can deal with!

189
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,462
That's not your concern!

190
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,765
Ms. Luna, I'm going to
rescue you now!

191
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,360
Wait, I have to kill you to keep
you from talking!

192
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,121
Two weeks have passed since
General Gilliam

193
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,289
successfully avoided capture by
the U.S. Military.

194
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,493
Sources in the U.S. have confirmed
that he was

195
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,696
responsible for the overthrow of the
Costero Republic.

196
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,365
The U.S. Government has
indicted Gilliam

197
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,068
for his involvement in a drug ring

198
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,705
responsible for smuggling over
70,000 tons of

199
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,342
illegal substances into the U.S.
Over the last five years.

200
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,346
Unconfirmed reports indicate that
Gilliam may have

201
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,305
fled Costero to avoid this attempt
to capture him.

202
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,720
It's a bit noisy outside, isn't it?

203
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,518
Two little mice are lost in the maze.

204
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,225
It doesn't effect our plans, does it?

205
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,261
You don't need to worry
about anything, Sir.

206
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,252
It will all be taken care of soon.

207
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,666
Hostages?

208
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,534
Yes, the banquet guests are
being held in the hotel.

209
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,598
I see. That means we
can't be careless.

210
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,416
I'm Agent Norton, Pentagon. If you
know Gilliam is in there,

211
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,884
why don't you do something?

212
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,687
Because there are hostages.

213
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,588
Hostages?

214
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,189
You have to remember
that this is Japan.
Hostages?

215
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,458
You have to remember
that this is Japan.

216
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,427
If you are planning something
foolhardy, I don't want to be involved.

217
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,106
As I thought...

218
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,717
An M29!

219
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,220
That sound, it's Falcon!

220
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,687
Umibozou?

221
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,623
An excellent guess.

222
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,360
Indeed, the people causing
all the noise

223
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,260
out there are Falcon and City Hunter.

224
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,626
Your partners.

225
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,287
There!

226
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,342
That was a good one.

227
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,446
What a persistent man!

228
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,328
The guests are hostages!


229
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,489
I wonder what the hell these
guys are planning to do?

230
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,627
Anyway, I don't see Luna anywhere.

231
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,028
Don't be so noisy, or they'll find us.

232
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,308
See, I told you!

233
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:16,842
Who is this man? He's not
dressed for the party.
See, I told you!

234
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,141
Who is this man? He's not
dressed for the party.

235
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,048
He might be the man who started
the disturbance outside.

236
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,449
All right, stand up!

237
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,916
Yeah, sure.

238
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,530
Who are these people?

239
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:38,764
I think they're soldiers under General
Gilliam from the Costero Republic.
Who are these people?

240
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,733
I think they're soldiers under General
Gilliam from the Costero Republic.

241
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,136
General Gilliam?

242
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,195
The man the U.S. Government is after?

243
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,440
Yes, I think so.

244
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,442
By the way, do you know anything
about a woman

245
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,444
that they kidnapped named Luna?

246
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,412
I don't know. But two women, Miki and
Kaori Makimura were taken

247
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:53,945
I don't know. But two women, Miki and
Kaori Makimura were taken

248
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,481
I don't know. But two women, Miki and
Kaori Makimura were taken

249
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
away by some of these guys
a little while ago.

250
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,513
Kaori and Miki? I didn't know
they were here!

251
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,519
When she was talking about free
dinner, she meant this place!

252
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,418
Free dinner?

253
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,891
Is all of this food free?

254
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,965
Yes...

255
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,026
Nothing! Empty!

256
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,706
My dinner is gone.

257
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,264
Wait a second, there might be...

258
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,276
Ta-dah!

259
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,536
I found it!

260
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,372
Kaori, you're wonderful! Thank you!

261
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,157
Very good!

262
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:44,493
I'm sorry to disturb you, but
can we run away now?

263
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,632
Well, Bay Bridge has been closed off,

264
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,134
so it might be a good idea if you hid

265
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,601
in some out of the way spot
on the island.

266
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,726
Yes, I see.

267
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,571
Die!

268
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,497
You jerk!

269
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,905
Gomez, where are you? Answer me!

270
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,385
I don't think he can respond right now.

271
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,253
What?

272
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:41,887
The man you're asking for is out cold.
What?

273
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,378
The man you're asking for is out cold.

274
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,258
You must be Falcon.

275
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,253
What good timing. I've got something
for you to hear.

276
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,731
Falcon?

277
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,170
Falcon, I'm fine. Get out of there!

278
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,571
Did you hear her?

279
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,707
Even though her life hangs by
a thread, she's still brave.

280
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,141
The room number is 3508.

281
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:09,781
If you want to get her back,
get here in ten minutes.

282
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:14,650
If you're even a second late,
she'll die in the explosion.

283
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,587
What?

284
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,705
Damn...

285
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,108
L, K, V...

286
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,487
Alpha, Cuba, Sierra...

287
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,684
Romeo, Delta, X-ray...

288
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,763
Charlie Mike, Charlie Gulf...

289
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,936
I didn't know you were one of
them, Luna Gilliam.

290
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,714
No way!

291
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,492
You haven't taken any action.

292
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,427
So from now on, we'll be handling
this matter.

293
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,122
You don't understand the
real situation, do you?

294
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,473
Ridiculous!

295
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,177
What the hell was that?!

296
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,548
Now you know. The terrorists
are heavily armed.

297
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,484
Why don't you dispatch fighter
planes or tanks?

298
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,349
The Pentagon will pay all expenses.

299
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,080
The only thing we can do is
leave things as they are.

300
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,925
As they are?

301
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,191
Exactly! We wait. The only
thing we can do is wait!
As they are?

302
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,251
Exactly! We wait. The only
thing we can do is wait!

303
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,832
What does the General plan to do?

304
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,427
My father will take revenge
against America.

305
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,205
Revenge against America?

306
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,641
America invaded my country
and chased my father out.

307
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,669
Hey, you came here to
find me, didn't you?

308
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,421
You're so good. I would feel
more secure

309
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,889
if you were my father's bodyguard.

310
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,620
Please, please leave my father alone.

311
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,258
Where is my partner?

312
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,173
The room she is in will explode
in a few minutes.

313
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,774
What? Where?

314
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,241
35th floor.

315
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,447
That's a freight elevator, it
only goes to the roof.

316
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,914
I wonder if you will make it?

317
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,112
You won't ruin my father's plan!

318
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,233
Mr. Saeba!

319
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,809
Where is Kaori?

320
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,242
They took her with them.
Where is Kaori?

321
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,310
They took her with them.

322
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,545
What?

323
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:33,812
That's not the only one! Behind you!
What?

324
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,541
That's not the only one! Behind you!

325
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:42,954
Miki!

326
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:43,455
Don't open the door, or the
room will explode!
Miki!

327
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,649
Don't open the door, or the
room will explode!

328
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,157
Ryo, the wall next to the door!

329
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,201
Falcon!

330
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,036
What the hell was that?

331
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,698
Ms. Nogami, what the hell did you do?

332
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,007
Nothing. I can say only one thing, the
situation is certainly changing.

333
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:36,508
Nothing. I can say only one thing, the
situation is certainly changing.

334
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,578
Nothing. I can say only one thing, the
situation is certainly changing.

335
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,413
That's not an answer!

336
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:46,281
Do you think I can risk the fate of my
country on a non-answer like that?

337
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,286
If you are so worried
about your country,

338
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,522
why don't you cut them off
from the Pentagon

339
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,683
by halting the Strategic Defense
System temporarily?

340
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,594
No way! I can't do that.
There's no evidence!

341
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,298
Then, why don't you bet on one
chance in ten thousand?

342
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,096
One in ten thousand?

343
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,164
Foxtrot, Kilo, Sierra...

344
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,199
Victor, Echo...

345
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,078
Luna, are you finished yet?

346
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,647
Papa, calm down.

347
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,317
There are three sequences left before
I can access the defense system.

348
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,784
I'm very close.

349
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,088
Do you guys think you'll get away
with something like this?!

350
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,291
If you do this, you'll go
straight to Hell!

351
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,124
Your tongues will be cut out
by the Judge of Hades!

352
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,091
If you don't pipe down, I'll
cut YOUR tongue out.

353
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,316
They're using the super computer at
this hotel to

354
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,410
access the Pentagon's Strategic
Defense System.

355
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:58,054
I guess Luna is a computer
expert, isn't she?

356
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,781
And what kind of expert are you?

357
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,254
Sex! Right?

358
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,297
Juliet, Oscar...

359
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,963
X-ray, Yankee, Zulu...

360
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,182
Access established!

361
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,684
The only thing I have to do now
is retarget the missiles!

362
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,208
Good job, Luna!

363
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,855
Now, all of the Americans' missiles will
rain down on their own country!

364
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:48,673
Aggressors, receive the just anger of
Gilliam, the greatest leader ever!

365
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,903
Insane! He is insane!

366
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,580
We don't have time to deal with
them! Others are in danger!

367
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,548
Come with me, Ryo!

368
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,874
Go! Kaori is in the underground
computer room.

369
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,341
Thanks.

370
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:39,585
Soon! I will have my revenge soon!

371
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,428
All that's left is to give the
launch order,

372
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,864
get out of here and blow up the hotel.

373
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,199
Blow up?

374
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:48,366
Yes, in order to erase the evidence.
Blow up?

375
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,164
Yes, in order to erase the evidence.

376
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,305
No way!

377
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:54,739
To erase all the evidence.
No way!

378
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,434
To erase all the evidence.

379
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,213
Your duty is over, Major Claude.

380
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,389
General, what are you...

381
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,259
Once my revenge is complete, the
best way to escape is to

382
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,093
make people believe that we
all died here.

383
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,728
Do you intend to betray everyone,
including your loyal followers?

384
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,970
Don't worry, you won't be lonely.

385
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,437
Stop!

386
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,778
Papa, I'm ready to launch.

387
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,649
Go ahead, Luna!

388
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,487
No, Luna! Why are you doing this?

389
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,054
Shut up!

390
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:43,988
It's not worth the price that
you'll pay, Luna!
Shut up!

391
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,580
It's not worth the price that
you'll pay, Luna!

392
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,751
Adios, America!

393
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,703
Don't touch the keyboard, Luna.

394
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,967
You're not really that evil.

395
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,577
Are you all right?

396
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,180
The food you hid under the
table was delicious.

397
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,552
What are you laughing at?

398
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:21,718
When I flip this switch, bombs set all
over the hotel will explode at once.

399
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,530
Luna, let the revenge commence!

400
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,624
Don't! Why would you risk your
life on a stupid thing like this?

401
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,674
If you are going to shoot me, do it.
But I know you won't shoot a woman.

402
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,739
Transfer error?!

403
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,772
The super computer is destroyed!

404
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,647
Now that's how you shut
off an appliance.

405
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,282
Umibozou!

406
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,651
I guess this was too much
for a rookie to handle.

407
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,621
It took a real expert like me
to finish the job.

408
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,492
What are you talking about? This isn't
your mission anyway, is it?

409
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,019
Damn, I'm going to send
all of you to Hell!

410
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,337
Papa!

411
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,045
Come with me!

412
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:48,746
Papa!
Come with me!

413
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:49,508
Papa!

414
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,126
What's that?

415
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,577
The hotel! What the hell is
going on over there?

416
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,813
Mr. Norton, after handling an
incident like this,

417
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,549
you'll probably get a double promotion.

418
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,319
You know, I never realized
until now how

419
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,083
good the morning sunshine could feel.

420
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,365
I guess Ryo and the others
evacuated safely.

421
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,832
Ms. Nogami!

422
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,203
I don't know what kind of
magic you used,

423
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,639
but I would like to express my
appreciation somehow.

424
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,407
No, thank you.

425
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,510
I think the bill for the hotel is going
to be pretty big all by itself.

426
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,378
What? Are you saying we have to
pay for all the damages?

427
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,012
What? Are you saying we have to
pay for all the damages?

428
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,715
What? Are you saying we have to
pay for all the damages?

429
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:35,584
Who was it that told me the Pentagon
would pay all expenses?

430
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,524
I'm going to be fired.

431
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,015
My promotion, my pension... gone...

432
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:54,071
Hey Ryo, if Umibozou hadn't shown up
when he did,

433
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,008
would you have shot Luna?

434
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,475
I don't know.

435
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,738
Umibozou, come here a second.

436
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,286
What do you want?

437
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,057
That Saeko's a schemer, isn't she?

438
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,551
She shuffled her job off onto you,
and I ended up working for free.

439
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,064
But you're the truly pathetic one.

440
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:25,127
You became a tool of authority, all
because you saw Saeko's tits.

441
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,805
I didn't see anything, but
Saeko was so upset!

442
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,374
I'm listening. Give me the details.

443
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,872
It was about two days ago.

444
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,918
She contacted me and asked
me to meet her

445
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,443
at the hotel pool so she could
tell me something.

446
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,024
What do you want to tell me?

447
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,897
What are you talking about?

448
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,067
I didn't ask you to come here.

449
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,830
What?! Wait, Saeko!

450
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,204
What did you do to me?!

451
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,306
I'm sorry.

452
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:02,940
You saw them, didn't you?
I'm sorry.

453
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,107
You saw them, didn't you?

454
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:03,808
You saw them, didn't you?
No, I didn't!

455
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:04,570
No, I didn't!

456
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,744
Yes, you did, and you
touched them too!

457
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,008
I touched you? Did I?

458
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,884
All right, here's the deal. If you'll do
this for me, I'll forgive you.

459
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:17,149
I just need you to bring a girl to me.

460
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:23,627
She's such a bitch! She intended
to trick me from the beginning!

461
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,652
That's her style.

462
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,600
Don't worry, I won't tell Miki about it.

463
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,067
Thanks.

464
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,000
No problem. This is called
"male bonding".

465
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,608
Miki!

466
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:43,614
Did you hear him? Umibozou
squeezed Saeko's tits!

467
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,150
Who the hell told you
I squeezed what?!

468
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,617
You die!

469
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,051
No, it's just a joke!
I said it's a joke!

470
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,091
Help me!
