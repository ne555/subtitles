354
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,599
I'm sorry!
I'm really sorry!

355
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,901
Are you all right?

356
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,903
Are you okay?

357
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,373
I'm not ranked, but I'm a pro boxer.

358
00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:28,877
Maybe we should go see a doctor...

359
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:30,879
Hey, aren't you the same guy?

360
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:33,148
Hey, wait!

361
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,917
I'm back!

362
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:39,321
Ah, Kosaku, you're just in time!

363
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:43,792
Go pack your stuff before
afternoon practice.

364
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:45,560
I can't take any chances.

365
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:48,597
From now on, I'm
keeping you under guard.

366
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:52,467
<i>That bastard! I won't let him
off with just a knockout.

367
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,869
<i>He's going to suffer!

368
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:07,750
Lower your center of gravity!

369
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:12,254
You have to lose four pounds
in the next five days!

370
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:18,627
From now on, this is your
food for the entire day.

371
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:21,497
Take your time and enjoy it.

372
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:23,766
Thank you.

373
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:35,110
1235 sheep.

374
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:37,379
1236 sheep.

375
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:42,952
This is no good. I'm so
hungry I can't sleep.

376
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:44,987
1237 sheep.

377
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:47,356
1238 sheep.

378
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:49,658
1239 sheep.

379
00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:51,193
1240 --

380
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:56,499
I've been having some
strange dreams lately.

381
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:59,035
I keep dreaming about sheep.

382
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:03,706
Hey, these are ringside seats!

383
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:05,207
Tomorrow's the big day.

384
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:08,010
Whatever happened to Mr. Boxer?

385
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:10,813
That's right, we
haven't seen him lately.

386
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,082
Speak of the devil!

387
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:24,026
That's quite a workout!

388
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,629
He didn't even look at us.

389
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,865
Well, that's no fun.

390
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:32,502
He didn't even say hi to his girlfriend!

391
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:34,304
I'm not his girlfriend!

392
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,639
I'm devoting my life to God!

393
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,207
You haven't taken your vows yet!

394
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,009
Maybe not, but...

395
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:43,846
But Sister, you see him pretty regularly.

396
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:45,915
It's not like that!

397
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:48,184
There he is again!

398
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:54,591
Hello, Sister. I... Uh...

399
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:57,894
There's no time to rest!
Keep running!

400
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:58,895
See you!

401
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:02,332
I can't take my eyes
off you for a second!

402
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,069
He said he'd see you!
You DO have a boyfriend!

403
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:08,338
I do not!

404
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:20,383
<i>I'm so hungry!

405
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,652
<i>I'm so thirsty!

406
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:26,456
Don't drink until the
weigh-in tomorrow!

407
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:31,027
Anything you drink now will
just add to your weight!

408
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,670
Remember:
Break your diet,

409
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:45,676
and you'll end up like this,
the day before a fight!

410
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:48,645
But Hatanaka worked hard.
Well done!

411
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:51,648
Put him to bed in the Coach's room.


412
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:52,716
Yes, sir!

413
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,724
Good evening.

414
00:34:00,724 --> 00:34:03,060
Yeah?

415
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,062
Well, hi!

416
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:08,799
Someone go upstairs and wake up Kosaku.

417
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:11,969
Come on in. Can I get you some tea?

418
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:17,441
I just happened to be in the
neighborhood. If he's asleep...

419
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:22,646
No, this is a fine time. He has
to get up for more practice.

420
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:26,317
Coach, he's gone! He escaped!

421
00:34:29,286 --> 00:34:30,220
Dammit!

422
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,155
We'll find him!

423
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:33,457
Everyone, stop your practice!

424
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:38,352
Check all the restaurants. Once
you find him, make him throw up!

425
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,565
He can't have any food!

426
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:42,166
Forget it.

427
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:45,936
I've had enough.
Don't bother to go after him.

428
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:49,673
He knows that if he eats, it's all over.

429
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,109
And if he does...

430
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:55,179
If he does eat, it's for the best.

431
00:34:55,246 --> 00:35:00,380
If he came this far only to fail,
I can finally give up on him.

432
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:03,020
I still trust Mr. Hatanaka.

433
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:06,190
We have to believe in him.

434
00:35:06,257 --> 00:35:07,792
I believe.

435
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,703
Good night, everyone.

436
00:35:28,112 --> 00:35:31,282
And he calls himself my superior!

437
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:36,254
Hey mister, how many?
They're hot and ready!

438
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:38,956
<i>Lord! Please!

439
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:42,527
<i>Save your lost lamb from
the Devil's temptation.

440
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:46,631
<i>Mr. Hatanaka! Hold out
for just one night!

441
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:51,202
Hey bud, what's wrong?
Aren't you hungry?

442
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,779
1275 kabobs.

443
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:03,047
1276 kabobs.

444
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:04,949
1277 kabobs.

445
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:09,220
Hey mister! We've got
some real babes in here!

448
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,993
Hi! Come on in!

449
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:32,043
Thanks for waiting. Here.

450
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,481
<i>My Lord!

451
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:00,607
Sister!

452
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:08,596
You...!

453
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,282
You are so--!

454
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,252
You betrayed your coach!
You betrayed me!

455
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,319
Is this...

456
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:17,656
Is the way you want it all to end?

457
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:30,135
Thank you!

458
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:34,340
I was about to defeat myself.

459
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:36,075
Please swear to me.

460
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:39,878
Promise that you won't
repeat this mistake.

461
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:42,414
The Lord hasn't given up on you yet.

462
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:45,651
Neither have your friends in the gym.

463
00:37:46,652 --> 00:37:48,854
And you?

464
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:52,525
I agree with the Lord.

465
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:53,926
Sister!

466
00:37:53,993 --> 00:37:56,195
Thank you so much!

467
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:07,740
Mr. Hatanaka?

468
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:16,415
Lord, please don't throw in the towel.

469
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:19,452
Please protect this lost lamb.

470
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,226
Fighter: Hatanaka,

471
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:30,530
126 pounds. You pass the weigh-in.

472
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:33,766
All right! That's great, Kosaku!

473
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,437
You passed on the first try!

474
00:38:37,503 --> 00:38:39,172
Incredible!

475
00:38:39,238 --> 00:38:42,408
Congratulations on passing your weigh-in.

476
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:45,278
I'm Jiro Amakusa. Nice to meet you.

477
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:47,814
Yeah, nice to meet you!

478
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:50,316
Until tonight, then.

479
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:53,019
Haven't we met somewhere?

480
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,754
Never!

481
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:58,157
Hey, where'd you get this shiner?

482
00:38:58,224 --> 00:39:01,127
That's none of your business!

483
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,833
Lord, please bless this meager repast.

484
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,005
May it grant this young man the
strength to endure his trials.

485
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:14,441
Amen.

486
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:17,477
What's wrong, Kosaku?
You can finally eat.

487
00:39:17,544 --> 00:39:19,479
You passed the weigh-in.

488
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:23,483
What is it, Mr. Hatanaka? Your
coach has said you could eat.

489
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,386
This much won't do any good.

490
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:29,489
What are you mumbling about?

491
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:31,491
Speak up! What's eating you?

492
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:33,493
I need more.

493
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,795
Oh, really?

494
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:40,734
Then eat this! A super jumbo
double-decker cheeseburger!

495
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:49,509
Coach! Look at that thing!

496
00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:52,646
What are you doing?
He's about to fight!

497
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:55,716
God may forgive him,
but his stomach won't.

498
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,709
After that starvation diet,
Kosaku will vomit that up.

499
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,895
Coach? Can I have seconds?

500
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:12,250
Ishida, get him to the bathroom
and make him throw up!

501
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:18,305
Not a chance!

502
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:19,540
That burger's in there to stay.

503
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,009
What a cast-iron stomach!

504
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:24,478
Yeah, it's custom-made.

505
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:28,497
Nothing will get that burger out,
short of a massive body-blow.

506
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:31,118
Oh no!

507
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:38,325
Go, Kosaku!

508
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,094
Do your best, Mr. Boxer!

509
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,163
Good luck!

510
00:40:44,798 --> 00:40:48,536
<i>He punched me in the
eye, not once but twice!

511
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:51,572
<i>Now he'll pay me back with interest!

512
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,743
<i>I'll give him ten times
the pain he gave me!

513
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:00,714
That's the way to do it, Kosaku!

514
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,783
You bastard!

515
00:41:14,662 --> 00:41:15,863
One!

516
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:17,431
All right! All right!

517
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:20,101
This is great!

518
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,602
Amakusa! Get up!

519
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:23,437
Stay down!

520
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:24,505
Eight!

521
00:41:24,572 --> 00:41:25,139
Nine!

522
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:28,376
You little punk! Don't get cocky!


523
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:29,944
Do it!

524
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:32,246
Finish him off!

525
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:50,598
What's wrong with you, Amakusa?

526
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,600
This should be a cakewalk!

527
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,637
Coach, what's Hatanaka's record?

528
00:41:55,703 --> 00:42:00,608
Two wins, five losses. Win or
lose, it's always a knockout.

529
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:05,246
<i>I don't get it! He's good!
Why hasn't he won more?

530
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:09,050
You really surprised them.

531
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:10,985
They expected this to be easy.

532
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:14,155
Kosaku's really great in the ring!

533
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:17,826
Yeah. As long as he can
conquer his appetite.

534
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:27,602
If you keep fighting like this,
I think you can take him.

535
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:28,770
What's wrong?

536
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,039
Nothing. I'm fine.

537
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,947
<i>Maybe I'll just hang back,
and see how he fights.

538
00:42:42,918 --> 00:42:46,721
<i>His legs are giving out.
Is he already tired?

539
00:42:46,788 --> 00:42:49,825
<i>If so, it's finally
time to take my revenge!

540
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:52,727
<i>I'm going to make him
chuck his cookies,

541
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:54,996
right in the ring!

542
00:42:57,799 --> 00:42:58,900
Oh no!

543
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,936
Mr. Hatanaka!

544
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:07,242
Kosaku, don't puke!

545
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:09,945
Hold it back! Hold it!

546
00:43:15,317 --> 00:43:16,885
Break!

547
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:26,728
- What is this?
- What the hell?

548
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,136
Is this a default?

549
00:43:34,203 --> 00:43:36,271
Well, Kosaku?

550
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:41,377
Are you going to quit? Are you
ready to give up boxing now?

551
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:43,746
The towel.

552
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:47,082
Please throw in the
towel, Coach Mukoda.

553
00:43:47,149 --> 00:43:48,751
Sister!

554
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:52,421
The Lord will forgive you.
No one will blame you.

555
00:43:52,488 --> 00:43:54,690
So, please...

556
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:03,866
Your Bible, Sister.

557
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:11,640
Please swear with me:

558
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:14,810
"I will never, ever
throw in the towel."

559
00:44:14,877 --> 00:44:17,079
Kosaku!

560
00:44:25,354 --> 00:44:29,678
- Isn't it over yet?
- Get him out of the ring!

561
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:38,835
<i>You've made me very happy!

562
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:43,639
<i>As thanks, I'm going to give
you everything I've got!

563
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,354
It's over!

564
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:01,925
This is it!

565
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:27,584
<i>This can't be happening!

566
00:45:32,322 --> 00:45:34,524
I don't believe it.

567
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:42,098
Kosaku Hatanaka!

568
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:47,771
Kosaku!

569
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:50,907
You did it! Now puke
as much as you want!

570
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:53,109
There's nothing left.

571
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:54,578
Oh, really?

572
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:06,323
Well, Sister?

573
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,457
Yes?

574
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:10,360
I guess I owe it all to God.

575
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:16,767
Somehow...

576
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:18,969
I don't think so.
