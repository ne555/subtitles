Suzu!
Suzu! Are you in there?
Shukumaru!
Suzu.
It's a little girl.
What are you doing here?
Are you all alone? Where's your mother?
Where'd you come from?
Always your eyes, watch me,
They always seem to see right through me
I never tire, of you,
Your sleeping face ensnares me
Your shadow is, a thing,
Of shining gold that will pierce me
I'll carry you, with me
So you'll always be in my heart
I can't see, as the rain falls,
Oh, my memory, it fades from me
On it goes, the dream rolls on,
Can it be so sad?
I hold on tight, but my,
Shoulders are still shaking, I can't stop
I cannot sleep, like this,
The terror still drives me on
Ah, only you can shake me,
Out of my dream
Soon you, will be with me...
Wow! Neat!
Shu!
Suzuko!
Look!
What happened to you?
I had an operation for apple-citis! Cool, huh?
Where? That's pretty impressive.
It was an acute apple-citis. Neat, huh?
Did you cry?
I never cry!
I'm sure you don't.
I don't cry!
I know.
Time to go home, okay? You just got out of the hospital.
Did you come out just to show everyone?
Yeah, 'cause my apple-citis is cool!
Yes, really cool!
Let's hurry home. I'll bet your mom's worried.
No, it's okay.
Oh yeah! I rode in an ambulance!
Hey, do you smell gas?
Shu, let's go.
What happened?
Oh, the gas explosion!
What's going on?
Excuse me...
He's dead!
Why? There was an explosion, but these people...
These people didn't die from that!
Where am I?
A girl!
A girl!
Somebody help me!
Mama!
Stop!
Don't kill me!
What's wrong with you? I just saved you!
Dammit!
Shukumaru!
Who's that?
What a strange kimono.
You bitch!
Stop it!
Shukumaru, these are Akauma's men!
Do you think they'll come for revenge?
Listen, stupid! Weaklings starve around here.
Hey, Shukumaru, there's a cart over there.
Great, it'll help us carry the salvage.
Okay.
Are you just going to sit there? Come on.
Hey, Shukumaru.
You're taking her along?
Sure, I found her, didn't I?
This is great! Look at all this rice!
Yeah, they must have raided another village.
Those bastards! Our lives mean nothing to them.
Where am I?
Where am I?
On a wagon.
What time is this?
Don't be stupid! It's obviously dusk.
Be serious!
I am!
Let me off. I have to get back.
Be careful, you idiot!
A bell...
Shukumaru and the others are back!
Wow!
Look at the sacks of rice!
{\i1}The civil war era?
Shukumaru, you're back!
Father!
Who's the woman?
Oh, her?
I found her on the battlefield.
Actually, I didn't get her name yet.
Well? what's your name?
Suzuko. It's written as "delightful child"
You heard.
Shukumaru!
Suzu!
Have you been a good girl?
I brought you a present.
It's pretty!
So we need a fence around the village. We can start tomorrow.
Is Akauma really going to attack us?
Probably.
This fool got carried away with looting.
That's true.
You jerk!
You're supposed to protect the village.
Nobody told you to go out stealing.
Right, so where do you think that rice came from?
You're living easy on what we steal for you.
You're worse than those thieves.
Everyone carries part of the blame.
But...
It's too late for second thoughts. We have to protect the village.
Shukumaru found something strange this time.
Look at her clothes!
She's so silent, it's creepy!
{\i1}Time slip...{\alpha&HFF&}\Nfrom the shock of the explosion?
{\i1}Time slip...\Nfrom the shock of the explosion?
{\i1}I want a bath.
{\i1}When I wake up, everything will be back to normal.
Are you going to be my brother's wife?
He said so, that he'd make you his wife.
You're Shukumaru's sister?
I'm going to be his wife too!
You're awake.
Shukumaru!
All right, come on.
What?
Once the dirt's off, you're a whole new person.
Now for your clothes.
{\i1}Does he really expect me to marry him?
We have plenty.
Help yourself.
So many of them...
We're not robbers. We stripped them off corpses.
Corpses?
I can't wear a dead person's clothes!
What?
What's that?
I never cry!
I know.
It's Shu's.
Where did you get this?
What?
A little boy was wearing it.
I don't know. I didn't take it.
Shu must have come with me.
I have to find him.
suzuko!
Wait! where are you going?
Shu!
Hold it, what's wrong?
I have to find Shu! We have to go back to the battlefield!
Don't be an idiot!
We took everything yesterday.
Then I'll go alone.
Idiot!
Do you want those robbers to find you again?
{\i1}If I don't find him soon, Shu will die.
There's no kids here.
He can't have gone far.
You're so stubborn. Look, just these bastards. No kid bodies.
Stop it! Shu isn't dead!
Creepy girl.
Shu!
Shu!
Shu!
Hey, let's eat.
I'm not hungry.
I guess people still get hungry, no matter what happens.
Here.
What is it?
You've never had chestnuts before?
Here.
Thanks.
Oh no, it's like an indirect kiss!
Don't you want any?
Yeah, I'm thirsty.
Get down!
Stop being so rough!
What's that?
One of Akauma's lackeys.
He's looking for his friends.
From yesterday.
The ones you killed?
Hurry up!
Shu!
Good, another one.
What's with Shukumaru?
He's been with that girl for five days.
Every day he packs a lunch and heads off to the battlefield.
Strange place for a date!
Shukumaru! Enjoying yourself?
Idiot! This isn't for fun.
You haven't slept with her yet?
What a weakling!
Aw, shut up.
I can't. She's still worried about that brat.
What's the matter? Are you afraid of girls?
Must be!
What?
I'm not an animal, like you guys.
Where are you going?
Shut up!
Shukumaru?
What are you doing here?
Suzuko!
Wait!
I'm sleeping here tonight.
What are you talking about? You're drunk!
Got any complaints?
Stop it!
Shut up. Do as I say.
Hey!
What's going on?
What an idiot.
My head hurts.
Suzuko, why was I sleeping in the barn?
Figure it out yourself.
I can't! That's why I'm asking!
Idiot.
I can't stand it.
Suzuko, this way.
Where are you going?
The water's beautiful!
I wish I could take a bath.
Great idea. I wanted to take a rest anyway.
What's that look for?
Forget it. Not after last night.
Why? What did I do?
Do I look like somebody who'd spy on you?
You promise not to look?
I won't look. Stupid girl.
Hey, Suzuko.
Don't look!
She's so suspicious.
What?
Where do you come from?
I said, where do you come from?
Far away...
What's his name -- the kid.
Is he your son?
Do I look like I've had a child?
Now that you mention it... no.
You looked at me. You liar!
Yikes. You scared me.
You really get mad, don't you?
You scared me.
You're back!
Suzu.
Why can't we leave the village?
Akauma's bandit's are nearby.
That arrow wasn't just for show. This is getting interesting.
Get the weapons out of the barn!
You guys go around back.
Suzuko, I'm scared!
Shu-kun.
What?
By the way, how old are you?
Why do you ask?
How old are you?
I'm a junior. Seventeen.
Seventeen? An old maid!
Old maid?
I don't know how you do things here, but--
Darn, I'm sixteen.
Oh well. You can still be my wife.
Great, it's settled. We'll get married after I beat Akauma.
Wait! What do you mean?
It's settled.
{\i1}Was that a proposal?
What happened?
{\i1}If I can't go back...
{\i1}Shukumaru is all I've got.
{\i1}But why'd he bring up marriage so suddenly?
{\i1}The village is in such trouble. Why at a time like this?
{\i1}Maybe BECAUSE it's in such trouble!
{\i1}He thinks he's going to die!
Suzu-san.
That's a pretty bell.
Do you want it?
I've already got one, just like it.
Mine's a little dirtier and doesn't make such a nice sound.
There's something you have to know.
We're not your real parents.
I wondered...
You don't have any baby pictures of me.
You were carrying this when we adopted you.
{\i1}No!
{\i1}It can't be!
{\i1}But...
{\i1}But if it's true...
{\i1}Then Shukumaru is my brother!
What's happening?
Got him!
Hold it!
The fire!
Suzu-san!
Suzu-san!
Shukumaru!
Suzuko!
Suzu's inside!
What?
Suzu! Suzu!
Suzu! Are you in there?
Shukumaru!
Suzu...
Where's that bastard Shukumaru?
Akauma!
So you were hiding.
You bastard! I wouldn't hide from you.
Die!
Is that supposed to hurt?
How about this?
Shukumaru.
Stop!
It was the fire.
{\i1}It's frightening when I see the flames.
It was ME!
You're awake.
Where are we?
My house.
It was hard sneaking you up here.
What about Akauma?
He's probably dead by now.
What happened to Suzu?
No, Shu! You just got out of the hospital!
I told you I was okay! Bye!
Shu-kun!
{\i1}He just got out of the hospital. Then today is...
Shu-kun! Don't go! Shukun!
{\i1}I've come back. But Shu...
{\i1}I have to save Shu!
{\i1}Three o'clock. The explosion was right before five.
{\i1}There's just time to treat his wounds.
No, I have to bandage you!
Oh, come on.
No!
I'm Suzu. I'm your sister!
Geez, you're covered with scars. Old and new.
What's this one? It's cleaner than the others.
That's my apple-citis.
Appendicitis?
What's wrong?
Shukumaru...
Shukumaru... you're Shu.
Hey, what's this?
That's the shirt Shukumaru was wearing when we found him.
You fell ten years past me. You must have felt so alone.
I have to go back to the village.
Let's go back, Suzuko.
Do you HAVE to go back?
Yeah.
Why?
They're helpless without me.
Besides, I owe the old man. He found me and raised me.
{\i1}We could go back.
{\i1}But...
Has it been a hard life?
Not really. I have some great friends.
Besides, from now on, you'll be with me.
Shukumaru...
Will you protect me forever?
Of course.
I used to worry a lot.
I thought Suzuko would vanish as quickly as she arrived.
But still...
All children eventually leave home to live their own lives.
The parents have to be happy about it.
Papa, Mama,
I'm sorry.
We can get back from here?
Soon.
Shukumaru, hold me tight.
Suzuko.
{\i1}This time, I won't let go.
Suzuko...
Hey, look!
Shukumaru.
I guess you're all too stubborn to die!
Why you!
Shukumaru!
Where have you been?
Shut up, and get started on the wedding!
Let's go, Suzuko.
Without waiting, for you to make me,
Promises again.
Not even, comprehending,
what even I can feel.
Alone  here again, alone in this room,
A lonely color, alone in this heat,
Alone with these sounds, alone with your voice,
Alone in this place;
Awake, your fear,
Unleash your claws, so all around you can see,
The fear arise inside.
The fear you feel,
The fear that haunts you, is the fear that makes
you feel so,
Hysteric!
Without waiting for, the power of wine,
Take me far away
Without reaching, to let my hair down,
Hair too long tied up
Alone here again, alone in this room,
Even the clothes, that I've come to love,
Alone with strange songs, so wrong for this time,
Yet still I can feel;
So bring your lips,
To me and all, that surrounds the two of us,
Kiss me, in spite of fear
You tremble with,
The fear that might, destroy the two of us;
Do you still feel,
Hysteric!
Special thanks goes out to Blanchimont
