Maris
The Choujo

He's scared to death.

That's disgusting!

Workers of the Jubei Shipping Agency!

You're under arrest for smuggling narcotics!

You did it, Maris.

Nothing to it, Murphy.

Finally, a vacation!

You're not wearing your restraints!

Damn!

Maris!

Lieutenant Maris, this is your third ship!

But General, I'm six times stronger than an Earthling.

It's your fault for giving me an Earth ship.

You're still responsible for the damages. Understand, Lieutenant?

Planet Oween

We're late! We just got the Concert tickets! Please hurry!

This way...

(Human Taxi)

You're looking for a Human Taxi, aren't you? AREN'T YOU?

I, uh...

Don't make her angry. She's from Thanatos!

The planet that blew up?

You're gonna hire me, right?

Yes, ma'am.

It's so hot!

Dammit! We finally got a vacation and I still have to work!

Quit complaining. How do you think I look, walking next to you?

Too expensive? Renting a car would have been twice as much!

Remember, Thanatos!

The breeze from 5,000 credits feels so cool!

Okay, let's find another victim.

This is so embarrassing.

I hate being poor!

Maris, phone call! It's long distance, from the planet Ahoya.

Hurry up!

I'm coming.

They said it was important.

Dad, come here. It's little Maris.

Maris, could you lend us some money?

I knew it.

We're at the supermarket, and your father's restraints broke.

Look! See this?

He was drinking and didn't notice they'd broken.

But when he leaned on the shelf... see?

And?

Someone better pay the damages, or I'm calling the police!

You're the only one we can turn to.

What am I supposed to do?

If only we weren't from Thanatos.

Mother, you promised not to talk about Thanatos.

But Maris...

Remember this moment. Burn it into your memories.

Our home, our motherland! This is the end of Thanatos.

All right. I'll get an advance and send whatever I can.

Thank you Maris.

Sorry to bother you again.

But...

What, Maris?

Next time, buy better restraints. No more bargain specials.

No more mail order trash, either!

Okay, Maris.

Bye.

Goodbye!

So Lieutenant, how's the ride in your new ship?

The ride? You got taken! It's a  secondhand '62 Pippopotamus!

Interstellar Consumer rates it a "worst buy".

That explains your scowl.

Look who's talking.

Did you enjoy your vacation?

I had to work the whole time!

That explains your scowl.

Look who's talking.

Did you enjoy your vacation?

Hey, General...

Oh yes,.. your advance. It should barely cover your hotel bill.

Thanks.

Have you forgotten how I rescued you from your last job?

Isn't the Space Patrol better than the cruel world of Pro Wrestling?

I'm still in debt.

Your next mission...

Why didn't you say so?

The son of a high official has been kidnapped.

The crooks are holed up on Moroi. They want a huge ransom.

A kidnapping?

The kidnappers sent us these pictures of their victim.

He's cheerful.

These were taken AFTER he was kidnapped?

Strangely happy, isn't he?

Probably because his father is a billionaire.

Billionaire?

He's Kogane Maru, son of Matsushita Sanchi.

Matsushita? The top of every society page in the galaxy?

Good luck!

Kogane Maru, hang on. I'm coming for you!

What are you thinking, Maris?

Didn't you hear, Murphy? He's the son of a billionaire!

You saved my life.
Please marry me.

Yup.

My beloved Maris!

Yup.

I slave away for a pitiful salary! I get no vacations!

Dad's an alcoholic and mom's an airhead!

And worst of all, I have to wear these STUPID restraints!

I hate this life!

Just a teensy crack. Nothing to worry about.

If we succeed, it's goodbye to this wretched life!

Hold on, my prince!

I'm sorry, but we're not meant for each other.

We come from two different worlds.

I want a graceful society girl...

not some cow from Thanatos!

You're just greedy pigs with fat thighs!

It would never work.

I hate this type!

Damn you! Stop using that stupid power!

Planet Moroi.

Our enemy approaches.

The fools! Sue, didn't you warn them not to contact the police?

Well, they're here. It's the Space Patrol Special Police.

Special Police? Fascinating.

Let's kill the hostage, as a warning.

Don't be a fool! We should kill the police, instead.

If we've got the hostage, we'll get the money.

Then we'll finally be able to buy a new fortress!

Yeah, this thing's ancient!

I hate this shoddy Earth junk!

I left a pathetic home on Bakan.

I've been fighting for money for five years! If only I were rich!

I'd finally be free of these stupid restraints!

Death to the Special Police!

I hate being poor!

Attack, Sue!

Roger!

God be with you.

I'll save you, my prince.

What's that?

Damn, they're on to me.

Prepare to die, Special Police Scum!

Vampire Maris!

Zombie Sue!

You're still alive!

And so deep in debt that you had to join the Special Police!

And you had to become a kidnapper!

The Special Police are just lackeys.

You do the Patrol's dirty work.

Am I wrong?

What was that?

Lackey! Lackey! Lackey!

Shut up you criminal!

Zombie Sue!

I can't lose!

I can't lose!

If I lose now, I'll always be poor!

If I lose now, I'll always be poor!

Bitch!

I'm behind her!

Die, kidnapper!

Gotcha!

Bye bye, Vampire Maris...

Forever.

I can't die now!

I trashed another ship.

When dawn has come,

I fall asleep.

Upon a world.

So strange to me.

Everywhere I turn.

Waves of sand I see.

I long for days.

When once again.

I'm near to you.

Beloved friend.

Please return the dream.

I hope stayed alive.

Entrusted to a future day.

Our memories are.

Like an oasis.

Each one a green

Lullaby.

In fertile grasslands.

Run hand in hand, and.

Lovers again.

Never to part, you and me.

Water...

Water!

Do you feel better now?

This is no time for jokes!

I've found the survivors. I'm going in for rescue.

What now? We're penniless. Do you want us to die in this gutter?

Shut up.

There it is!

There! There!

I've found a job!

What's that?

Look, over there! Now we can buy food!

It figures. Even out here, it was just a passing fad.

So you survived, Lt. Maris.

I'm up here.

General!

You're here?

I lost contact and decided to investigate.

Return to base for your new orders.

Planet Ahoya
Special Police Headquarters

Four ships, advance pay, new restraints.

A 30-year loan at 100,000
credits a month...

plus all your bonuses should cover it.

That leaves nothing for me!

Your new ship is ready. Now rescue that hostage!

Good luck. Maris.

There are two of us. What's with the huge cabin?

Wait, my prince.

Let's go. Murphy.

Roger.

Wait, Murphy, and emergency call.

Maris, we need a little more money.

But we're at the restraint store, see?

And?

Your father stopped for a few teensy drinks.

I had the wallet, but I looked away for a second...

Father, Mother, hold on.

I'll get rich and buy you a planet where you won't need restraints.

Murphy! Let's go!

We're here, we're here!

Doesn't this seem suspicious?

How did we slip in so easily?

I'll save you soon, my prince!

I'm yours! I'm yours!

WE'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR BASE!!

I'm all yours. Now hand over the cash!

What did you say?

That I'll never talk to you again!

Maris, I've always loved you!

Don't be an idiot!

Welcome to Moroi, Miss Special Police.

Who are you?

My welcoming committee is waiting outside.

One false move and he's dead.

Throw down your weapons and come out.

Raise your hands. Make it snappy!

Oh no, half the landing gear is completely ruined.

What's that?

A remote lock for your restraints.

Shall we go?

A prefab Earth base. Looks flimsy.

Ancient.

Don't underestimate it. It's efficient.

Yeah, right.

Keep moving.

An execution?

I have the perfect method.

I'll kill her slowly and painfully.

Want to watch?

It's no sport watching a hawk devour a sparrow.

If you say so.

Good luck.

So, Kogane Maru, it seems you've lost your last hope.

Enjoy your dinner.

You don't look well.

What do you plan to do with me?

With restraints on a Thanatosian is as weak as an Earthling.

I'm only strength 3. Normally, I could never beat a Thanatosian.

Don't interfere or you're toast.

It's no use. You need the control to remove them.

Dammit!

You'll die slowly.

No fair! What a rotten cheat!

I hate being poor!

Here I come!

Don't parade your poverty!

I'm poorer than you!

Damn it!

Time out!

Maris...

Damn it!

Bitch!

Which one's real? Which one's real?

That one!

The control!

I can't reach!

She'll be dead before you can get it.

Dammit!

Almost...

Octopuses!

Almost...

Got it!

Bingo!

It's open!

Wait! What are you doing?

Watch this, bitch!

Stop it! Don't break it, please!

Not my base! Please stop!

Shut up!

Stop!

You're the chief kidnapper!

Indeed.

Give me the money--

-- I mean the hostage!

I can't do that.

We'll die with our fortress, taking all of you with us!

Never mind. I give up.

Why?

She wrecked my base! How can we go on?

Do you really want to stop? So soon?

That's boring.

Kogane Maru!

Are you surprised? Miss Specto Politi, uh,..

Police.

Yeah. Miss Police.

What? You were in league together?

No. I really kidnapped him, but...

I was so bored, so I decided to try a life of evil.

Only a billionaire's son could be so bold.

You were great. Your rescue went perfectly, Miss Special, uh...

Police. Maris.

Miss Police-Maris.

Yup.

My world is so poor! Everyone is poor. That's why I ran away.

This was my last hope. It cost so much to get this base!

Kogane Maru...

Let's go - - back to your father.

I even wore those stupid restraints to protect my beautiful base.

Don't cry.

We can make a new one. I'll give you the money.

Sue...

Don't you hate me?

Why? It was fun.

Don't cry, you'll ruin your pretty face.

Hey, let's get married, Sue.

Yup.

Lieutenant Maris, what happened?

If you break this one, it'll be your fifth ship!

I hate being poor!

The End.

The inside of your heart is like a poisoned mushroom!

Like a lightning bolt it flies, it's energy!

You're a perfect specimen, an Amazoness!

The physical beat soars through the sky!

This world is really built on bucks, I'd say.

Money affects everything today.

So, if you're happy, and you know it, too.

Clap your hands!

Poverty! Violently!

Love is all powerful!

Poverty! Celebrity!

Take it all, big success!

Heaven and Hell are divided by a road of money!

Coins jingle jingle a merry sound, marry for money!

In a pinch some money would be as good.

It's the chance to dance, I know you will take!

All men are boys with the bucks, I'd say.

Their bodies gleam, credit charged, you know!

Super greedy with incredible,

Sexy Power!

Poverty! Violently!

The future will be like that!

Poverty! Celebrity!

Fiery good success!

This world is really built on bucks, I'd say.

It's easy living in a broken dream.

Deep in the jungle of a cosmic sea.

Woman Power!

Poverty! Violently!

Love is all powerful!

Poverty! Celebrity!

Take it all, big success!

Okay!
