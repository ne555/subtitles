Suzu!

20
0:01:02,22 --> 0:01:04,85
Suzu! Are you in there?

21
0:01:04,89 --> 0:01:07,06
Shukumaru!

22
0:01:22,28 --> 0:01:24,54
Suzu.

23
0:02:33,23 --> 0:02:35,61
It's a little girl.

24
0:02:35,65 --> 0:02:38,28
What are you doing here?

25
0:02:40,40 --> 0:02:43,28
Are you all alone? Where's your mother?

26
0:02:43,32 --> 0:02:45,78
Where'd you come from?

27
0:03:15,27 --> 0:03:19,32
Always your eyes, watch me,

28
0:03:20,19 --> 0:03:24,24
They always seem to see right through me

29
0:03:24,28 --> 0:03:28,62
I never tire, of you,

30
0:03:29,16 --> 0:03:32,95
Your sleeping face ensnares me

31
0:03:33,45 --> 0:03:37,63
Your shadow is, a thing,

32
0:03:38,13 --> 0:03:42,38
Of shining gold that will pierce me

33
0:03:42,42 --> 0:03:46,47
I'll carry you, with me

34
0:03:47,26 --> 0:03:51,26
So you'll always be in my heart

35
0:03:52,43 --> 0:03:56,89
I can't see, as the rain falls,

36
0:03:57,10 --> 0:04:00,02
Oh, my memory, it fades from me

37
0:04:01,23 --> 0:04:05,90
On it goes, the dream rolls on,

38
0:04:05,90 --> 0:04:09,28
Can it be so sad?

39
0:04:09,66 --> 0:04:13,66
I hold on tight, but my,

40
0:04:14,45 --> 0:04:18,62
Shoulders are still shaking, I can't stop

41
0:04:18,67 --> 0:04:22,34
I cannot sleep, like this,

42
0:04:23,42 --> 0:04:27,38
The terror still drives me on

43
0:04:27,92 --> 0:04:34,89
Ah, only you can shake me,

44
0:04:35,14 --> 0:04:36,93
Out of my dream

45
0:04:36,97 --> 0:04:39,81
Soon you, will be with me...

46
0:04:43,56 --> 0:04:45,78
Wow! Neat!

47
0:04:47,40 --> 0:04:49,45
Shu!

48
0:04:49,49 --> 0:04:50,78
Suzuko!

49
0:04:50,82 --> 0:04:52,49
Look!

50
0:04:52,53 --> 0:04:54,62
What happened to you?

51
0:04:54,66 --> 0:04:58,33
I had an operation for apple-citis! Cool, huh?

52
0:04:58,37 --> 0:05:00,96
Where? That's pretty impressive.

53
0:05:01,00 --> 0:05:04,88
It was an acute apple-citis. Neat, huh?

54
0:05:04,92 --> 0:05:06,04
Did you cry?

55
0:05:06,04 --> 0:05:07,13
I never cry!

56
0:05:07,17 --> 0:05:08,71
I'm sure you don't.

57
0:05:08,71 --> 0:05:10,97
I don't cry!

58
0:05:11,01 --> 0:05:12,59
I know.

59
0:05:12,63 --> 0:05:17,51
Time to go home, okay? You just got out of the hospital.

60
0:05:18,31 --> 0:05:20,64
Did you come out just to show everyone?

61
0:05:20,68 --> 0:05:23,35
Yeah, 'cause my apple-citis is cool!

62
0:05:23,40 --> 0:05:25,65
Yes, really cool!

63
0:05:28,48 --> 0:05:31,65
Let's hurry home. I'll bet your mom's worried.

64
0:05:31,70 --> 0:05:33,32
No, it's okay.

65
0:05:33,36 --> 0:05:36,99
Oh yeah! I rode in an ambulance!

66
0:05:37,03 --> 0:05:39,49
Hey, do you smell gas?

67
0:05:43,92 --> 0:05:46,17
Shu, let's go.

68
0:06:16,57 --> 0:06:18,82
What happened?

69
0:06:23,20 --> 0:06:25,71
Oh, the gas explosion!

70
0:06:49,48 --> 0:06:51,73
What's going on?

71
0:06:54,57 --> 0:06:56,78
Excuse me...

72
0:06:59,66 --> 0:07:00,95
He's dead!

73
0:07:00,99 --> 0:07:05,29
Why? There was an explosion, but these people...

74
0:07:06,12 --> 0:07:11,54
These people didn't die from that!

75
0:07:13,63 --> 0:07:15,84
Where am I?

76
0:07:20,80 --> 0:07:21,97
A girl!

77
0:07:22,01 --> 0:07:24,18
A girl!

78
0:07:53,54 --> 0:07:56,04
Somebody help me!

79
0:07:56,09 --> 0:07:58,34
Mama!

80
0:08:35,25 --> 0:08:37,96
Stop!

81
0:08:38,00 --> 0:08:39,80
Don't kill me!

82
0:08:39,84 --> 0:08:43,59
What's wrong with you? I just saved you!

83
0:08:44,18 --> 0:08:46,64
Dammit!

84
0:08:46,68 --> 0:08:48,89
Shukumaru!

85
0:08:49,56 --> 0:08:51,81
Who's that?

86
0:08:53,23 --> 0:08:55,69
What a strange kimono.

87
0:08:57,02 --> 0:08:59,69
You bitch!

88
0:08:59,73 --> 0:09:01,19
Stop it!

89
0:09:01,23 --> 0:09:04,53
Shukumaru, these are Akauma's men!

90
0:09:05,74 --> 0:09:08,66
Do you think they'll come for revenge?

91
0:09:08,70 --> 0:09:11,70
Listen, stupid! Weaklings starve around here.

92
0:09:11,74 --> 0:09:15,62
Hey, Shukumaru, there's a cart over there.








93
0:09:16,79 --> 0:09:21,75
Great, it'll help us carry the salvage.

94
0:09:21,80 --> 0:09:23,21
Okay.

95
0:09:23,26 --> 0:09:26,34
Are you just going to sit there? Come on.

96
0:09:26,38 --> 0:09:27,72
Hey, Shukumaru.

97
0:09:27,76 --> 0:09:29,30
You're taking her along?

98
0:09:29,39 --> 0:09:32,35
Sure, I found her, didn't I?

99
0:09:40,86 --> 0:09:44,28
This is great! Look at all this rice!

100
0:09:44,32 --> 0:09:47,95
Yeah, they must have raided another village.

101
0:09:47,99 --> 0:09:52,24
Those bastards! Our lives mean nothing to them.

102
0:09:57,00 --> 0:09:59,21
Where am I?

103
0:10:00,46 --> 0:10:01,88
Where am I?

104
0:10:01,92 --> 0:10:04,13
On a wagon.

105
0:10:05,76 --> 0:10:07,76
What time is this?

106
0:10:07,84 --> 0:10:11,26
Don't be stupid! It's obviously dusk.

107
0:10:11,34 --> 0:10:13,10
Be serious!

108
0:10:13,18 --> 0:10:15,14
I am!

109
0:10:15,22 --> 0:10:18,31
Let me off. I have to get back.

110
0:10:22,52 --> 0:10:24,98
Be careful, you idiot!

111
0:10:27,99 --> 0:10:30,28
A bell...

112
0:10:37,70 --> 0:10:41,00
Shukumaru and the others are back!

113
0:10:50,88 --> 0:10:52,13
Wow!

114
0:10:52,18 --> 0:10:54,89
Look at the sacks of rice!

115
0:11:12,86 --> 0:11:15,11
{\i1}The civil war era?

116
0:11:17,74 --> 0:11:19,04
Shukumaru, you're back!

117
0:11:19,04 --> 0:11:20,95
Father!

118
0:11:21,00 --> 0:11:22,83
Who's the woman?

119
0:11:22,87 --> 0:11:25,08
Oh, her?

120
0:11:26,75 --> 0:11:29,88
I found her on the battlefield.

121
0:11:30,42 --> 0:11:33,88
Actually, I didn't get her name yet.

122
0:11:35,59 --> 0:11:38,68
Well? what's your name?

123
0:11:40,06 --> 0:11:43,77
Suzuko. It's written as "delightful child"

124
0:11:43,81 --> 0:11:44,85
You heard.

125
0:11:44,94 --> 0:11:46,14
Shukumaru!

126
0:11:46,14 --> 0:11:48,36
Suzu!

127
0:11:55,20 --> 0:11:57,82
Have you been a good girl?

128
0:11:57,86 --> 0:12:00,45
I brought you a present.

129
0:12:04,87 --> 0:12:07,08
It's pretty!

130
0:12:20,39 --> 0:12:25,35
So we need a fence around the village. We can start tomorrow.

131
0:12:25,39 --> 0:12:29,23
Is Akauma really going to attack us?

132
0:12:29,48 --> 0:12:31,73
Probably.

133
0:12:32,40 --> 0:12:36,44
This fool got carried away with looting.

134
0:12:36,49 --> 0:12:38,11
That's true.

135
0:12:38,15 --> 0:12:39,95
You jerk!

136
0:12:39,99 --> 0:12:43,45
You're supposed to protect the village.

137
0:12:43,49 --> 0:12:45,95
Nobody told you to go out stealing.

138
0:12:46,00 --> 0:12:50,37
Right, so where do you think that rice came from?

139
0:12:54,09 --> 0:12:57,63
You're living easy on what we steal for you.

140
0:12:57,67 --> 0:13:00,51
You're worse than those thieves.

141
0:13:00,55 --> 0:13:03,51
Everyone carries part of the blame.

142
0:13:03,55 --> 0:13:05,76
But...

143
0:13:08,48 --> 0:13:14,02
It's too late for second thoughts. We have to protect the village.

144
0:13:15,36 --> 0:13:18,49
Shukumaru found something strange this time.

145
0:13:18,53 --> 0:13:20,15
Look at her clothes!

146
0:13:20,20 --> 0:13:23,16
She's so silent, it's creepy!

147
0:13:25,53 --> 0:13:28,58
{\i1}Time slip...{\alpha&HFF&}
from the shock of the explosion?

148
0:13:28,58 --> 0:13:31,71
{\i1}Time slip...
from the shock of the explosion?

149
0:13:32,92 --> 0:13:35,13
{\i1}I want a bath.

150
0:13:36,29 --> 0:13:40,72
{\i1}When I wake up, everything will be back to normal.

151
0:14:17,46 --> 0:14:21,05
Are you going to be my brother's wife?

152
0:14:22,30 --> 0:14:26,05
He said so, that he'd make you his wife.

153
0:14:27,14 --> 0:14:29,89
You're Shukumaru's sister?

154
0:14:31,47 --> 0:14:34,60
I'm going to be his wife too!

155
0:14:34,64 --> 0:14:36,02
You're awake.

156
0:14:36,10 --> 0:14:38,31
Shukumaru!

157
0:14:40,23 --> 0:14:42,40
All right, come on.

158
0:14:45,90 --> 0:14:48,16
What?

159
0:14:59,58 --> 0:15:02,34
Once the dirt's off, you're a whole new person.

160
0:15:08,18 --> 0:15:10,89
Now for your clothes.

161
0:15:12,60 --> 0:15:16,18
{\i1}Does he really expect me to marry him?

162
0:15:34,70 --> 0:15:37,25
We have plenty.

163
0:15:37,29 --> 0:15:39,50
Help yourself.

164
0:15:47,17 --> 0:15:48,76
So many of them...

165
0:15:48,80 --> 0:15:52,84
We're not robbers. We stripped them off corpses.

166
0:15:52,89 --> 0:15:55,14
Corpses?

167
0:15:55,18 --> 0:15:59,10
I can't wear a dead person's clothes!

168
0:15:59,14 --> 0:16:01,35
What?

169
0:16:12,24 --> 0:16:14,45
What's that?

170
0:16:19,41 --> 0:16:21,37
I never cry!

171
0:16:21,41 --> 0:16:23,29
I know.

172
0:16:25,17 --> 0:16:27,42
It's Shu's.

173
0:16:28,50 --> 0:16:30,05
Where did you get this?

174
0:16:30,09 --> 0:16:32,22
What?

175
0:16:32,26 --> 0:16:34,05
A little boy was wearing it.

176
0:16:34,09 --> 0:16:37,18
I don't know. I didn't take it.

177
0:16:38,14 --> 0:16:40,98
Shu must have come with me.

178
0:16:43,60 --> 0:16:45,15
I have to find him.

179
0:16:45,19 --> 0:16:46,73
suzuko!

180
0:16:46,77 --> 0:16:49,53
Wait! where are you going?

181
0:16:51,65 --> 0:16:53,90
Shu!

182
0:16:57,16 --> 0:16:59,95
Hold it, what's wrong?

183
0:16:59,99 --> 0:17:04,79
I have to find Shu! We have to go back to the battlefield!

184
0:17:04,83 --> 0:17:06,38
Don't be an idiot!

185
0:17:06,38 --> 0:17:08,79
We took everything yesterday.

186
0:17:08,84 --> 0:17:11,09
Then I'll go alone.

187
0:17:12,13 --> 0:17:13,72
Idiot!

188
0:17:13,76 --> 0:17:17,76
Do you want those robbers to find you again?

189
0:17:24,35 --> 0:17:27,98
{\i1}If I don't find him soon, Shu will die.

190
0:17:43,87 --> 0:17:46,33
There's no kids here.

191
0:17:46,37 --> 0:17:48,21
He can't have gone far.

192
0:17:48,25 --> 0:17:53,34
You're so stubborn. Look, just these bastards. No kid bodies.

193
0:17:53,38 --> 0:17:55,84
Stop it! Shu isn't dead!

194
0:17:55,88 --> 0:17:58,13
Creepy girl.

195
0:17:59,55 --> 0:18:01,76
Shu!

196
0:18:06,39 --> 0:18:08,85
Shu!

197
0:18:15,57 --> 0:18:18,15
Shu!

198
0:18:33,42 --> 0:18:35,21
Hey, let's eat.

199
0:18:35,25 --> 0:18:37,46
I'm not hungry.

200
0:18:44,10 --> 0:18:48,48
I guess people still get hungry, no matter what happens.

201
0:18:48,52 --> 0:18:51,06
Here.

202
0:18:51,10 --> 0:18:52,40
What is it?

203
0:18:52,44 --> 0:18:55,73
You've never had chestnuts before?

204
0:19:02,78 --> 0:19:04,28
Here.

205
0:19:04,32 --> 0:19:06,83
Thanks.

206
0:19:06,87 --> 0:19:09,37
Oh no, it's like an indirect kiss!

207
0:19:09,41 --> 0:19:10,50
Don't you want any?

208
0:19:10,50 --> 0:19:12,92
Yeah, I'm thirsty.

209
0:19:15,29 --> 0:19:17,50
Get down!

210
0:19:17,55 --> 0:19:19,80
Stop being so rough!

211
0:19:20,97 --> 0:19:22,51
What's that?

212
0:19:22,55 --> 0:19:25,14
One of Akauma's lackeys.

213
0:19:27,97 --> 0:19:30,89
He's looking for his friends.

214
0:19:32,94 --> 0:19:35,44
From yesterday.

215
0:19:35,48 --> 0:19:37,82
The ones you killed?

216
0:19:49,66 --> 0:19:51,91
Hurry up!

217
0:20:03,01 --> 0:20:05,22
Shu!

218
0:20:07,51 --> 0:20:09,22
Good, another one.

219
0:20:09,26 --> 0:20:11,72
What's with Shukumaru?

220
0:20:12,64 --> 0:20:15,77
He's been with that girl for five days.

221
0:20:15,85 --> 0:20:19,98
Every day he packs a lunch and heads off to the battlefield.

222
0:20:20,02 --> 0:20:22,69
Strange place for a date!

223
0:20:27,53 --> 0:20:29,62
Shukumaru! Enjoying yourself?

224
0:20:29,66 --> 0:20:32,41
Idiot! This isn't for fun.

225
0:20:39,33 --> 0:20:42,55
You haven't slept with her yet?

226
0:20:42,59 --> 0:20:43,96
What a weakling!

227
0:20:43,96 --> 0:20:45,55
Aw, shut up.

228
0:20:45,59 --> 0:20:49,05
I can't. She's still worried about that brat.

229
0:20:49,09 --> 0:20:53,18
What's the matter? Are you afraid of girls?

230
0:20:53,26 --> 0:20:55,47
Must be!

231
0:20:56,10 --> 0:20:57,23
What?

232
0:20:57,27 --> 0:21:00,52
I'm not an animal, like you guys.

233
0:21:16,45 --> 0:21:17,70
Where are you going?

234
0:21:17,70 --> 0:21:19,92
Shut up!

235
0:21:48,82 --> 0:21:51,07
Shukumaru?

236
0:21:55,95 --> 0:21:58,58
What are you doing here?

237
0:22:10,92 --> 0:22:14,26
Suzuko!

238
0:22:14,97 --> 0:22:17,05
Wait!

239
0:22:17,10 --> 0:22:20,22
I'm sleeping here tonight.

240
0:22:20,27 --> 0:22:23,56
What are you talking about? You're drunk!

241
0:22:23,60 --> 0:22:26,06
Got any complaints?

242
0:22:26,10 --> 0:22:27,56
Stop it!

243
0:22:27,61 --> 0:22:30,07
Shut up. Do as I say.

244
0:22:31,11 --> 0:22:33,32
Hey!

245
0:22:38,58 --> 0:22:40,83
What's going on?

246
0:23:09,19 --> 0:23:11,44
What an idiot.

247
0:23:27,87 --> 0:23:30,25
My head hurts.

248
0:23:30,29 --> 0:23:33,38
Suzuko, why was I sleeping in the barn?

249
0:23:33,42 --> 0:23:35,51
Figure it out yourself.

250
0:23:35,55 --> 0:23:37,30
I can't! That's why I'm asking!

251
0:23:37,30 --> 0:23:39,22
Idiot.

252
0:23:39,26 --> 0:23:41,47
I can't stand it.

253
0:23:42,55 --> 0:23:44,81
Suzuko, this way.

254
0:23:46,68 --> 0:23:49,02
Where are you going?

255
0:24:07,75 --> 0:24:10,25
The water's beautiful!

256
0:24:22,01 --> 0:24:24,22
I wish I could take a bath.

257
0:24:24,26 --> 0:24:28,22
Great idea. I wanted to take a rest anyway.

258
0:24:28,27 --> 0:24:30,23
What's that look for?

259
0:24:30,27 --> 0:24:33,31
Forget it. Not after last night.

260
0:24:33,35 --> 0:24:37,19
Why? What did I do?

261
0:24:37,23 --> 0:24:41,07
Do I look like somebody who'd spy on you?

262
0:24:48,66 --> 0:24:51,96
You promise not to look?

263
0:24:52,00 --> 0:24:54,75
I won't look. Stupid girl.

264
0:26:12,95 --> 0:26:14,16
Hey, Suzuko.

265
0:26:14,16 --> 0:26:15,87
Don't look!










266
0:26:15,95 --> 0:26:18,04
She's so suspicious.

267
0:26:18,08 --> 0:26:19,12
What?

268
0:26:19,17 --> 0:26:21,71
Where do you come from?

269
0:26:25,96 --> 0:26:29,47
I said, where do you come from?

270
0:26:29,51 --> 0:26:31,39
Far away...

271
0:26:31,47 --> 0:26:34,85
What's his name -- the kid.

272
0:26:34,85 --> 0:26:36,43
Is he your son?

273
0:26:36,52 --> 0:26:39,02
Do I look like I've had a child?

274
0:26:39,06 --> 0:26:42,11
Now that you mention it... no.

275
0:26:48,19 --> 0:26:51,24
You looked at me. You liar!

276
0:26:51,28 --> 0:26:52,95
Yikes. You scared me.

277
0:26:52,99 --> 0:26:55,99
You really get mad, don't you?

278
0:26:56,87 --> 0:26:59,12
You scared me.

279
0:27:04,92 --> 0:27:07,13
You're back!

280
0:27:07,96 --> 0:27:10,22
Suzu.

281
0:27:28,98 --> 0:27:31,78
Why can't we leave the village?

282
0:27:31,82 --> 0:27:34,49
Akauma's bandit's are nearby.

283
0:27:34,53 --> 0:27:40,00
That arrow wasn't just for show. This is getting interesting.

284
0:27:40,04 --> 0:27:43,21
Get the weapons out of the barn!

285
0:27:45,04 --> 0:27:47,00
You guys go around back.

286
0:27:54,38 --> 0:27:56,93
Suzuko, I'm scared!

287
0:27:59,64 --> 0:28:01,89
Shu-kun.

288
0:28:04,23 --> 0:28:05,48
What?



289
0:28:05,52 --> 0:28:07,61
By the way, how old are you?

290
0:28:07,65 --> 0:28:09,69
Why do you ask?

291
0:28:09,73 --> 0:28:12,49
How old are you?

292
0:28:14,90 --> 0:28:17,03
I'm a junior. Seventeen.

293
0:28:17,07 --> 0:28:20,28
Seventeen? An old maid!

294
0:28:21,16 --> 0:28:23,54
Old maid?

295
0:28:23,58 --> 0:28:27,21
I don't know how you do things here, but--

296
0:28:27,25 --> 0:28:29,88
Darn, I'm sixteen.

297
0:28:30,54 --> 0:28:33,92
Oh well. You can still be my wife.

298
0:28:34,92 --> 0:28:40,05
Great, it's settled. We'll get married after I beat Akauma.

299
0:28:41,51 --> 0:28:43,77
Wait! What do you mean?

300
0:28:43,81 --> 0:28:46,02
It's settled.

301
0:28:47,27 --> 0:28:50,19
{\i1}Was that a proposal?

302
0:28:52,61 --> 0:28:54,86
What happened?


303
0:28:59,62 --> 0:29:03,49
{\i1}If I can't go back...

304
0:29:04,79 --> 0:29:07,54
{\i1}Shukumaru is all I've got.

305
0:29:11,04 --> 0:29:15,01
{\i1}But why'd he bring up marriage so suddenly?


306
0:29:17,34 --> 0:29:22,18
{\i1}The village is in such trouble. Why at a time like this?


307
0:29:23,64 --> 0:29:27,10
{\i1}Maybe BECAUSE it's in such trouble!

308
0:29:27,14 --> 0:29:30,02
{\i1}He thinks he's going to die!

309
0:29:32,48 --> 0:29:34,73
Suzu-san.

310
0:29:43,49 --> 0:29:45,91
That's a pretty bell.

311
0:29:47,16 --> 0:29:49,66
Do you want it?

312
0:29:49,71 --> 0:29:53,00
I've already got one, just like it.

313
0:29:54,21 --> 0:29:59,22
Mine's a little dirtier and doesn't make such a nice sound.


314
0:30:00,01 --> 0:30:03,14
There's something you have to know.

315
0:30:03,18 --> 0:30:07,35
We're not your real parents.

316
0:30:11,77 --> 0:30:13,98
I wondered...

317
0:30:15,19 --> 0:30:19,74
You don't have any baby pictures of me.

318
0:30:23,20 --> 0:30:27,74
You were carrying this when we adopted you.

319
0:30:37,54 --> 0:30:39,75
{\i1}No!

320
0:30:45,26 --> 0:30:47,51
{\i1}It can't be!

321
0:30:49,26 --> 0:30:51,72
{\i1}But...

322
0:30:51,77 --> 0:30:53,98
{\i1}But if it's true...

323
0:30:54,77 --> 0:30:57,69
{\i1}Then Shukumaru is my brother!

324
0:31:07,20 --> 0:31:09,45
What's happening?

325
0:31:58,62 --> 0:32:00,83
Got him!

326
0:32:15,10 --> 0:32:17,35
Hold it!

327
0:32:25,69 --> 0:32:27,94
The fire!

328
0:32:45,54 --> 0:32:47,76
Suzu-san!

329
0:32:48,05 --> 0:32:49,67
Suzu-san!

330
0:32:54,68 --> 0:32:56,47
Shukumaru!

331
0:32:56,47 --> 0:32:58,60
Suzuko!

332
0:33:04,06 --> 0:33:06,27
Suzu's inside!

333
0:33:06,31 --> 0:33:08,57
What?

334
0:33:09,48 --> 0:33:11,44
Suzu! Suzu!

335
0:33:14,24 --> 0:33:16,07
Suzu! Are you in there?

336
0:33:16,12 --> 0:33:18,33
Shukumaru!

337
0:33:31,84 --> 0:33:34,05
Suzu...

338
0:33:37,76 --> 0:33:40,89
Where's that bastard Shukumaru?

339
0:33:43,43 --> 0:33:45,65
Akauma!

340
0:33:47,36 --> 0:33:49,48
So you were hiding.

341
0:33:49,52 --> 0:33:53,11
You bastard! I wouldn't hide from you.

342
0:34:02,33 --> 0:34:04,54
Die!

343
0:34:23,02 --> 0:34:25,68
Is that supposed to hurt?

344
0:34:33,32 --> 0:34:35,57
How about this?

345
0:34:51,63 --> 0:34:53,50
Shukumaru.

346
0:35:01,55 --> 0:35:03,80
Stop!

347
0:35:17,99 --> 0:35:20,74
It was the fire.

348
0:35:30,58 --> 0:35:35,79
{\i1}It's frightening when I see the flames.

349
0:35:42,59 --> 0:35:44,85
It was ME!

350
0:36:05,66 --> 0:36:07,41
You're awake.

351
0:36:07,45 --> 0:36:08,66
Where are we?

352
0:36:08,66 --> 0:36:10,08
My house.

353
0:36:10,12 --> 0:36:13,08
It was hard sneaking you up here.

354
0:36:13,12 --> 0:36:15,42
What about Akauma?

355
0:36:15,46 --> 0:36:18,09
He's probably dead by now.

356
0:36:18,13 --> 0:36:21,05
What happened to Suzu?

357
0:36:22,63 --> 0:36:25,76
No, Shu! You just got out of the hospital!

358
0:36:25,80 --> 0:36:28,68
I told you I was okay! Bye!

359
0:36:30,60 --> 0:36:32,81
Shu-kun!

360
0:36:37,06 --> 0:36:41,44
{\i1}He just got out of the hospital. Then today is...

361
0:36:42,15 --> 0:36:45,74
Shu-kun! Don't go! Shukun!

362
0:36:51,41 --> 0:36:54,12
{\i1}I've come back. But Shu...

363
0:36:54,75 --> 0:36:57,00
{\i1}I have to save Shu!

364
0:36:58,75 --> 0:37:03,09
{\i1}Three o'clock. The explosion was right before five.

365
0:37:03,13 --> 0:37:06,68
{\i1}There's just time to treat his wounds.

366
0:37:24,15 --> 0:37:26,28
No, I have to bandage you!

367
0:37:26,32 --> 0:37:27,65
Oh, come on.

368
0:37:27,70 --> 0:37:29,91
No!

369
0:37:30,95 --> 0:37:34,58
I'm Suzu. I'm your sister!


370
0:37:38,54 --> 0:37:42,63
Geez, you're covered with scars. Old and new.


371
0:37:42,67 --> 0:37:46,26
What's this one? It's cleaner than the others.

372
0:37:46,30 --> 0:37:48,76
That's my apple-citis.

373
0:37:51,72 --> 0:37:54,01
Appendicitis?

374
0:38:00,06 --> 0:38:02,31
What's wrong?

375
0:38:02,48 --> 0:38:04,23
Shukumaru...

376
0:38:14,70 --> 0:38:18,00
Shukumaru... you're Shu.

377
0:38:34,93 --> 0:38:37,14
Hey, what's this?

378
0:38:38,31 --> 0:38:43,19
That's the shirt Shukumaru was wearing when we found him.


379
0:38:53,95 --> 0:38:58,83
You fell ten years past me. You must have felt so alone.


380
0:39:01,08 --> 0:39:04,29
I have to go back to the village.

381
0:39:05,29 --> 0:39:07,79
Let's go back, Suzuko.

382
0:39:12,84 --> 0:39:14,97
Do you HAVE to go back?

383
0:39:15,01 --> 0:39:15,76
Yeah.

384
0:39:15,76 --> 0:39:16,51
Why?

385
0:39:16,55 --> 0:39:18,80
They're helpless without me.

386
0:39:18,85 --> 0:39:23,77
Besides, I owe the old man. He found me and raised me.


387
0:39:23,81 --> 0:39:26,02
{\i1}We could go back.

388
0:39:26,81 --> 0:39:29,06
{\i1}But...

389
0:39:29,86 --> 0:39:32,86
Has it been a hard life?

390
0:39:33,94 --> 0:39:37,74
Not really. I have some great friends.

391
0:39:37,78 --> 0:39:40,53
Besides, from now on, you'll be with me.

392
0:39:54,21 --> 0:39:55,55
Shukumaru...

393
0:40:04,35 --> 0:40:07,44
Will you protect me forever?

394
0:40:08,44 --> 0:40:10,69
Of course.

395
0:40:30,96 --> 0:40:33,42
I used to worry a lot.

396
0:40:34,25 --> 0:40:41,05
I thought Suzuko would vanish as quickly as she arrived.

397
0:40:41,43 --> 0:40:43,39
But still...

398
0:40:43,43 --> 0:40:49,64
All children eventually leave home to live their own lives.



399
0:40:50,06 --> 0:40:53,65
The parents have to be happy about it.

400
0:41:02,49 --> 0:41:04,66
Papa, Mama,

401
0:41:05,45 --> 0:41:07,66
I'm sorry.

402
0:41:29,77 --> 0:41:31,89
We can get back from here?

403
0:41:31,93 --> 0:41:34,15
Soon.

404
0:41:36,56 --> 0:41:39,19
Shukumaru, hold me tight.

405
0:41:39,23 --> 0:41:40,65
Suzuko.

406
0:41:43,86 --> 0:41:46,62
{\i1}This time, I won't let go.

407
0:42:06,84 --> 0:42:09,10
Suzuko...

408
0:42:59,06 --> 0:43:01,31
Hey, look!

409
0:43:06,78 --> 0:43:08,99
Shukumaru.

410
0:43:13,45 --> 0:43:17,12
I guess you're all too stubborn to die!

411
0:43:18,08 --> 0:43:20,25
Why you!

412
0:43:20,25 --> 0:43:20,92
Shukumaru!

413
0:43:20,92 --> 0:43:22,63
Where have you been?

414
0:43:22,67 --> 0:43:26,42
Shut up, and get started on the wedding!

415
0:43:36,60 --> 0:43:38,85
Let's go, Suzuko.


416
0:46:23,68 --> 0:46:27,27
Without waiting, for you to make me,

417
0:46:27,31 --> 0:46:29,56
Promises again.

418
0:46:30,56 --> 0:46:33,73
Not even, comprehending,

419
0:46:33,73 --> 0:46:35,94
what even I can feel.

420
0:46:35,98 --> 0:46:39,49
Alone  here again, alone in this room,

421
0:46:39,53 --> 0:46:42,70
A lonely color, alone in this heat,

422
0:46:42,74 --> 0:46:46,16
Alone with these sounds, alone with your voice,

423
0:46:46,20 --> 0:46:48,54
Alone in this place;

424
0:46:50,33 --> 0:46:53,37
Awake, your fear,

425
0:46:53,37 --> 0:46:59,30
Unleash your claws, so all around you can see,

426
0:47:00,21 --> 0:47:03,38
The fear arise inside.

427
0:47:03,76 --> 0:47:06,76
The fear you feel,

428
0:47:06,89 --> 0:47:12,56
The fear that haunts you, is the fear that makes

429
0:47:13,60 --> 0:47:16,48
you feel so,

430
0:47:16,81 --> 0:47:20,36
Hysteric!

431
0:47:20,82 --> 0:47:24,32
Without waiting for, the power of wine,

432
0:47:24,36 --> 0:47:26,62
Take me far away

433
0:47:27,66 --> 0:47:31,16
Without reaching, to let my hair down,

434
0:47:31,20 --> 0:47:32,91
Hair too long tied up

435
0:47:32,96 --> 0:47:36,33
Alone here again, alone in this room,

436
0:47:36,38 --> 0:47:39,80
Even the clothes, that I've come to love,

437
0:47:39,84 --> 0:47:43,22
Alone with strange songs, so wrong for this time,

438
0:47:43,26 --> 0:47:45,63
Yet still I can feel;

439
0:47:47,39 --> 0:47:50,51
So bring your lips,

440
0:47:50,51 --> 0:47:55,81
To me and all, that surrounds the two of us,

441
0:47:57,35 --> 0:48:00,06
Kiss me, in spite of fear

442
0:48:00,90 --> 0:48:03,11
You tremble with,

443
0:48:03,94 --> 0:48:10,53
The fear that might, destroy the two of us;

444
0:48:10,70 --> 0:48:13,70
Do you still feel,

445
0:48:13,95 --> 0:48:17,75
Hysteric!

446
0:48:17,75 --> 0:48:31,35
Special thanks goes out to Blanchimont

447
0:49:59,43 --> 0:50:01,43
