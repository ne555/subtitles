0:01:03,97 --> 0:01:06,22
Azusa!

4
0:01:47,51 --> 0:01:49,76
Azusa!

5
0:04:02,98 --> 0:04:05,44
Bull's eye! Wow!

6
0:04:05,44 --> 0:04:07,90
Isn't he great?

7
0:04:07,90 --> 0:04:09,48
Every time!

8
0:04:09,53 --> 0:04:13,40
Hey you freshmen, quit acting like a bunch of groupies!

9
0:04:13,45 --> 0:04:16,53
It's nothing, it just takes practice.

10
0:04:16,57 --> 0:04:19,45
Here I go again. watch this.

11
0:04:28,29 --> 0:04:30,55
Incredible!

12
0:04:36,68 --> 0:04:40,68
What was all that? You were leading them on.

13
0:04:41,77 --> 0:04:44,77
Sorry, I got carried away.

14
0:04:44,77 --> 0:04:48,77
The team captain should be more responsible.

15
0:04:51,90 --> 0:04:54,15
What's wrong?

16
0:04:55,07 --> 0:04:56,20
Satomi-kun...

17
0:04:56,24 --> 0:04:57,61
What?

18
0:04:57,66 --> 0:05:00,83
You're not jealous, are you?

19
0:05:00,87 --> 0:05:03,08
Who, me?

20
0:05:06,79 --> 0:05:08,79
Wanna go for coffee?

21
0:05:08,83 --> 0:05:11,04
I can't

22
0:05:11,09 --> 0:05:14,80
My fiancée's coming in from the country.

23
0:05:16,09 --> 0:05:20,22
You never told me about a fiancée!

24
0:05:20,26 --> 0:05:23,39
What in hell are you dating me for?

25
0:05:23,43 --> 0:05:25,98
No, it happened when I was just a kid.

26
0:05:26,02 --> 0:05:27,89
She's my cousin.

27
0:05:27,94 --> 0:05:29,60
Cousin?

28
0:05:29,65 --> 0:05:31,90
Your cousin is your fiancée?

29
0:05:36,78 --> 0:05:38,32
Weird.

30
0:05:38,36 --> 0:05:42,41
My aunt forced us into it. She was sort of domineering.

31
0:05:43,62 --> 0:05:48,37
Sister, it's too soon for this decision. He's only six.

32
0:05:48,41 --> 0:05:50,92
The earlier, the better.

33
0:05:50,96 --> 0:05:53,42
Azusa is the Shiga family's only daughter.

34
0:05:53,46 --> 0:05:55,67
She can't marry outside the clan.

35
0:05:55,71 --> 0:05:57,76
Why must it be Yuzuru?

36
0:05:57,80 --> 0:06:03,80
I trust him, knowing he's your son. Yuzuru will marry Azusa.

37
0:06:04,30 --> 0:06:07,77
I'm head of this family. You will obey me.

38
0:06:07,81 --> 0:06:08,89
Sister...

39
0:06:25,91 --> 0:06:32,00
It's settled, Azusa. When you grow up, you'll be Yuzuru-san's wife.

40
0:06:32,46 --> 0:06:34,88
Yes... {\alpha&HFF&}Mother

41
0:06:34,88 --> 0:06:37,09
Yes... Mother.

42
0:06:54,06 --> 0:06:56,40
Anyway, I was forced into it.

43
0:06:56,44 --> 0:07:01,28
My aunt passed away last winter, leaving Azusa all alone.

44
0:07:01,32 --> 0:07:04,32
Father decided to take her in.

45
0:07:05,03 --> 0:07:08,49
My aunt's death was kind of strange.

46
0:07:09,74 --> 0:07:12,66
So you'll be head of the clan?

47
0:07:12,70 --> 0:07:14,41
I see.{\alpha&HFF&} Let's break up.

48
0:07:14,41 --> 0:07:16,12
I see. Let's break up.

49
0:07:16,17 --> 0:07:20,34
You don't get it at all! That was years ago!

50
0:07:20,38 --> 0:07:24,51
She probably has plenty of boyfriends by now.

51
0:07:24,55 --> 0:07:29,43
I doubt it. I'll bet she thinks about you all the time

52
0:07:30,43 --> 0:07:31,89
No way!

53
0:07:31,89 --> 0:07:34,06
You never know.

54
0:07:34,10 --> 0:07:36,35
Well... maybe.

55
0:07:40,44 --> 0:07:41,94
Let's go.

56
0:07:47,36 --> 0:07:49,03
See you tomorrow.

57
0:07:49,07 --> 0:07:51,33
Bye.

58
0:07:53,12 --> 0:07:56,50
I'll try to be a better captain, tomorrow.

59
0:07:56,54 --> 0:07:59,38
Say hi to Azusa-san for me.

60
0:07:59,42 --> 0:08:01,63
Sure.

61
0:08:05,59 --> 0:08:07,26
I'm home.

62
0:08:07,80 --> 0:08:10,43
I'm home. is Azusa here yet?

63
0:08:10,47 --> 0:08:13,18
She's waiting for you.

64
0:08:13,22 --> 0:08:16,10
She's probably all grown up.

65
0:08:28,49 --> 0:08:31,20
Azusa!

66
0:08:31,24 --> 0:08:33,45
Yuzuru-san.

67
0:08:39,46 --> 0:08:42,83
You surprised me. You're really beautiful.

68
0:08:42,88 --> 0:08:45,96
You've grown up, over the last five years.

69
0:08:46,00 --> 0:08:47,96
You too.

70
0:08:48,01 --> 0:08:51,55
So tell me about your boyfriends.

71
0:08:52,22 --> 0:08:55,97
I've never spoken to a boy my age.

72
0:08:56,01 --> 0:08:58,89
What? You're joking, right?

73
0:09:00,52 --> 0:09:02,73
But... I have you.

74
0:09:11,86 --> 0:09:17,49
Hey Yuzuru-san. Don't you want me to be your wife?

75
0:09:17,54 --> 0:09:19,16
Sure I do. {\alpha&HFF&}I like you.

76
0:09:19,16 --> 0:09:21,83
Sure I do. I like you.

77
0:09:21,87 --> 0:09:24,75
Really?, You really like me?

78
0:09:25,46 --> 0:09:28,00
Cross your heart and hope to die?

79
0:09:28,05 --> 0:09:30,30
It's a promise.

80
0:09:47,40 --> 0:09:49,44
What a tragedy.

81
0:09:49,48 --> 0:09:53,45
And her daughter's left without any friends or family.

82
0:09:53,49 --> 0:09:56,20
But what a peculiar death!

83
0:10:03,00 --> 0:10:06,46
Thank you, you've been very helpful.

84
0:10:07,17 --> 0:10:11,50
Do you have any plans, now that the estate is settled?

85
0:10:12,09 --> 0:10:14,47
I'll take her with me to Tokyo.

86
0:10:14,51 --> 0:10:17,55
But what about the main house?

87
0:10:18,18 --> 0:10:21,26
I'll arrange for it to be sold.

88
0:10:22,06 --> 0:10:27,27
No. I'll marry Yuzuru-san, and we'll take over the Shiga family.

89
0:10:28,52 --> 0:10:31,27
Mother would have wanted it that way.

90
0:10:31,32 --> 0:10:33,07
Azusa?

91
0:10:33,11 --> 0:10:35,32
Yuzuru-san promised me.

92
0:11:13,27 --> 0:11:15,48
Be silent!

93
0:11:16,74 --> 0:11:18,99
Be silent!

94
0:11:20,28 --> 0:11:22,41
Can it be light? It's sparkling too bright

95
0:11:22,41 --> 0:11:25,08
City schools frighten me.

96
0:11:27,29 --> 0:11:29,54
Can love be,

97
0:11:30,62 --> 0:11:32,88
Dangerous?

98
0:11:34,13 --> 0:11:37,80
Meetings made by chance will always be,

99
0:11:40,80 --> 0:11:47,39
Hearts beat fiercely and,

100
0:11:48,02 --> 0:11:50,27
Body trembling

101
0:11:53,60 --> 0:11:56,02
Hey Shiga!

102
0:11:56,07 --> 0:11:57,69
You've got guts!

103
0:11:57,73 --> 0:12:00,24
What's going on?

104
0:12:00,28 --> 0:12:03,36
She's my cousin. She just transferred here.

105
0:12:03,41 --> 0:12:05,78
Be careful!

106
0:12:03,41 --> 0:12:06,99
She's cute!

107
0:12:04,74 --> 0:12:06,99
Hey, she's shaking.

108
0:12:07,03 --> 0:12:10,08
Be careful!

109
0:12:07,03 --> 0:12:10,08
Ouch, I'm stung.

110
0:12:08,74 --> 0:12:10,08
What's wrong?

111
0:12:10,12 --> 0:12:14,46
You are, you are trembling and burning

112
0:12:10,91 --> 0:12:12,62
Hey, Azusa!

113
0:12:17,34 --> 0:12:19,59
Ah, love is,

114
0:12:20,76 --> 0:12:22,97
Dangerous

115
0:12:24,22 --> 0:12:27,10
I can no longer turn back and look...

116
0:12:31,73 --> 0:12:35,56
The autumn storm blew a chill wind on the Emperor's grief.

117
0:12:35,60 --> 0:12:38,40
He couldn't forget his beautiful mistress.

118
0:12:38,44 --> 0:12:41,23
So he sent Myobu to the lady's grandmother.

119
0:12:41,28 --> 0:12:46,45
The moon shone beautifully on the night she left.

120
0:12:47,32 --> 0:12:49,58
Ohta, you read.

121
0:12:50,62 --> 0:12:52,16
Start wih the next passage.

122
0:12:52,20 --> 0:12:54,54
Page 25, sixth line.

123
0:12:57,25 --> 0:13:00,71
On nights like this, they would play the koto.

124
0:13:00,75 --> 0:13:05,97
Her koto had always carried especially beautiful overtones.

125
0:13:07,47 --> 0:13:11,18
Her voice also had a rare charm to it.

126
0:13:16,10 --> 0:13:18,77
He was reminded of the poem,

127
0:13:18,81 --> 0:13:23,36
{\i1}"The darkness steals reality and turns it into dream"

128
0:13:34,75 --> 0:13:37,79
It must be nice to have such a cute fiancée.

129
0:13:37,83 --> 0:13:41,29
I told you not to worry about that!

130
0:13:41,34 --> 0:13:43,46
I'm not worried!

131
0:13:43,50 --> 0:13:46,80
But what's with her? Some cousin!

132
0:13:46,84 --> 0:13:48,51
She's hanging all over you!

133
0:13:48,55 --> 0:13:50,30
You {\i1}are{\i0} worried!

134
0:13:50,34 --> 0:13:52,35
Don't follow me!

135
0:13:52,39 --> 0:13:55,77
But we're both headed for the same club!

136
0:14:03,69 --> 0:14:07,32
Azusa had a strict upbringing. She's never met any guys.

137
0:14:07,36 --> 0:14:11,32
But I'm sure she'll start looking at other men now.

138
0:14:11,36 --> 0:14:13,32
I don't think so.

139
0:14:13,37 --> 0:14:17,33
You're the problem. She's really beautiful.

140
0:14:17,37 --> 0:14:21,50
She sure is! I was really surprised yesterday!

141
0:14:21,54 --> 0:14:23,29
She is?

142
0:14:23,33 --> 0:14:27,34
I mean, she's beautiful, but you're really cute!

143
0:14:27,38 --> 0:14:29,26
You didn't let me finish.

144
0:14:29,30 --> 0:14:33,05
What's my being cute have to do with it?

145
0:14:37,77 --> 0:14:42,81
Anyway, she's nothing to me. She's my cousin, nothing more.

146
0:15:16,43 --> 0:15:19,18
I'll meet you at the gate.

147
0:15:52,51 --> 0:15:54,72
Who's there?

148
0:16:02,60 --> 0:16:04,85
Who is it?

149
0:16:25,45 --> 0:16:27,66
Azusa-san.

150
0:16:27,71 --> 0:16:30,21
Stay away from Yuzuru-san.

151
0:16:32,92 --> 0:16:36,09
He's my fiancé. Don't interfere.

152
0:16:37,47 --> 0:16:42,93
That was when you were children. He and I are...

153
0:16:45,93 --> 0:16:49,44
Yuzuru-san is mine!

154
0:17:00,03 --> 0:17:02,24
No! Stay back!

155
0:17:13,50 --> 0:17:17,76
You'd better not tell Yuzuru-san about this.

156
0:17:38,15 --> 0:17:40,36
She's late.

157
0:17:45,78 --> 0:17:47,53
Shiga-kun!

158
0:17:47,58 --> 0:17:49,83
Satomi.

159
0:17:50,70 --> 0:17:52,96
What's wrong?

160
0:17:56,79 --> 0:17:59,00
Azusa-san is...

161
0:18:13,64 --> 0:18:15,90
Over there!

162
0:18:22,65 --> 0:18:24,90
What's wrong?

163
0:18:28,24 --> 0:18:30,45
Nothing.

164
0:19:58,16 --> 0:20:00,37
Help me, Yuzuru-san.

165
0:21:08,27 --> 0:21:11,73
It's dangerous to be out here alone.

166
0:21:12,86 --> 0:21:15,32
Not too bad looking.

167
0:21:15,36 --> 0:21:18,53
There's nothing to be afraid of.

168
0:22:35,94 --> 0:22:40,03
{\i1}I belong to Yuzuru-san. No one else may touch me.

169
0:22:49,20 --> 0:22:50,75
Yuzuru, anything else?

170
0:22:50,79 --> 0:22:53,04
No, thanks.

171
0:22:53,08 --> 0:22:57,96
{\i1}What's wrong with Satomi? She wouldn't say a single word.

172
0:22:59,13 --> 0:23:00,42
Dessert?

173
0:23:00,42 --> 0:23:02,68
Later.

174
0:23:12,81 --> 0:23:15,90
This is Shiga. Is Satomi-san there?

175
0:23:24,16 --> 0:23:26,66
Azusa.

176
0:23:26,70 --> 0:23:28,12
Why'd you do that?

177
0:23:28,16 --> 0:23:30,41
Yuzuru-san.

178
0:23:30,45 --> 0:23:32,58
Do you hate me?

179
0:23:35,00 --> 0:23:40,05
What's wrong with me? I've been faithful to you.

180
0:23:41,34 --> 0:23:43,22
Don't cry.

181
0:23:43,26 --> 0:23:45,47
But...

182
0:23:50,01 --> 0:23:53,39
Dammit, why are you so stuck on me?

183
0:23:54,06 --> 0:23:57,48
You told me you loved me.

184
0:23:58,61 --> 0:24:00,82
That was years ago!

185
0:24:02,03 --> 0:24:05,70
Is a childhood promise any less sacred?

186
0:24:11,74 --> 0:24:14,00
Is it?

187
0:24:28,59 --> 0:24:30,85
{\i1}It's {\b0}her{\b1} fault.

188
0:24:32,06 --> 0:24:34,93
{\i1}She's trying to take Yuzuru-san.

189
0:24:41,06 --> 0:24:43,07
What's wrong, Satomi?

190
0:24:43,11 --> 0:24:44,28
You feeling okay?

191
0:24:44,32 --> 0:24:47,78
We're going ahead. See you there.

192
0:25:15,14 --> 0:25:16,60
It just shattered!

193
0:25:16,64 --> 0:25:19,35
Satomi, are you all right?

194
0:25:21,10 --> 0:25:23,36
Satomi!

195
0:25:25,57 --> 0:25:27,82
You're bleeding.

196
0:25:50,17 --> 0:25:51,59
Are you going home?

197
0:25:51,63 --> 0:25:54,64
No. I don't want to be alone.

198
0:25:54,68 --> 0:25:56,47
I'll stay for archery.

199
0:25:56,51 --> 0:25:59,68
All right. I'll walk you there.

200
0:26:13,66 --> 0:26:16,37
{\i1}Azusa.

201
0:26:16,41 --> 0:26:18,58
{\i1}It couldn't be Azusa.

202
0:26:18,62 --> 0:26:20,87
{\i1}That's ridiculous.

203
0:26:21,83 --> 0:26:26,25
{\i1}How could she break the glass? That's impossible.

204
0:26:28,71 --> 0:26:32,47
{\i1}"You'd better not tell Yuzuru-san about this."

205
0:26:36,64 --> 0:26:41,02
{\i1}I can't tell him. Besides, he'd never believe me.

206
0:27:01,62 --> 0:27:03,87
See you later.

207
0:27:05,75 --> 0:27:07,96
Bye!

208
0:27:40,49 --> 0:27:42,91
Here I am.

209
0:27:42,95 --> 0:27:45,20
Satomi.

210
0:27:48,16 --> 0:27:49,79
Satomi!

211
0:28:43,39 --> 0:28:45,47
Satomi!

212
0:28:47,72 --> 0:28:49,06
Satomi!















213
0:28:56,86 --> 0:28:57,69
Stop!

214
0:29:00,32 --> 0:29:01,53
Satomi!

215
0:29:28,85 --> 0:29:32,52
Satomi. That was Azusa, wasn't it?

216
0:29:33,93 --> 0:29:37,23
I don't know. I really don't know.

217
0:29:40,52 --> 0:29:41,82
I want to go home.

218
0:29:41,86 --> 0:29:44,11
Okay, let's go.

219
0:29:51,41 --> 0:29:56,79
According to Dad, my aunt avoided her other relatives.

220
0:29:57,58 --> 0:29:59,42
Was it because of Azusa?

221
0:29:59,46 --> 0:30:02,38
Please don't talk about her.

222
0:30:04,92 --> 0:30:07,34
Thanks for walking her home.

223
0:30:07,38 --> 0:30:10,05
It's okay. See you later.

224
0:30:11,05 --> 0:30:14,02
Shiga-kun...

225
0:30:14,02 --> 0:30:16,23
Be careful.

226
0:30:21,94 --> 0:30:24,19
Bye, Jun.


227
0:30:39,96 --> 0:30:41,63
Silence.

228
0:30:48,51 --> 0:30:50,72
Jun, what's wrong?

229
0:30:59,98 --> 0:31:02,23
Jun! Who did this?

230
0:31:04,52 --> 0:31:08,44
{\i1}It was her. How could she do such a thing?

231
0:31:10,20 --> 0:31:12,41
{\i1}I'm next!

232
0:31:22,29 --> 0:31:24,71
Where did you go?

233
0:31:43,69 --> 0:31:45,40
{\i1}I smell blood.

234
0:31:47,61 --> 0:31:48,77
Azusa!

235
0:31:55,70 --> 0:31:58,41
What did you do to Satomi?

236
0:31:59,16 --> 0:32:01,70
Tell me! What did you do?

237
0:32:01,75 --> 0:32:04,50
Stop it, Yuzuru! What are you saying?

238
0:32:04,54 --> 0:32:09,25
What have you done? What's that blood on your coat?

239
0:32:09,29 --> 0:32:12,97
I don't know! I didn't do anything!

240
0:32:19,55 --> 0:32:22,02
How could you, Yuzuru-san?

241
0:32:42,70 --> 0:32:44,91
Hello? Satomi-san?

242
0:32:47,58 --> 0:32:49,79
{\i1}Hello?

243
0:32:50,50 --> 0:32:52,13
Satomi.

244
0:32:52,13 --> 0:32:56,80
{\i1}Shiga-kun, Jun's been killed. I can't go back to school.

245
0:32:57,55 --> 0:33:01,10
Satomi, tell me. Did Azusa do something to you?

246
0:33:01,14 --> 0:33:03,35
{\i1}Is she there?

247
0:33:05,39 --> 0:33:08,19
{\i1}After school tomorrow, come to my house.

248
0:33:08,23 --> 0:33:09,73
I will.


249
0:33:09,77 --> 0:33:12,73
{\i1}Don't let her know.

250
0:33:12,90 --> 0:33:15,11
Okay.

251
0:33:28,66 --> 0:33:30,92
Azusa,

252
0:33:34,13 --> 0:33:38,22
I finally understand what those creatures were.

253
0:33:38,26 --> 0:33:43,55
They were the hungry ghosts. They consume dead flesh.

254
0:33:43,68 --> 0:33:49,52
I held back for the sake of our family. But I can't any more.


255
0:34:03,95 --> 0:34:06,16
Mother!

256
0:34:06,16 --> 0:34:07,66
Azusa.

257
0:34:12,75 --> 0:34:15,71
I will not let you continue the Shiga family!

258
0:34:15,75 --> 0:34:17,88
Stop, Mother!

259
0:34:17,88 --> 0:34:21,22
This is the end of the Shiga clan!

260
0:34:23,22 --> 0:34:26,76
No, I'm going to be Yuzuru-san's wife!

261
0:34:26,80 --> 0:34:29,02
You're a demon!

262
0:34:40,65 --> 0:34:42,90
Mother!

263
0:34:51,20 --> 0:34:56,21
{\pos(39,448)}*MAIN FAMILY: My Aunt's death
*TEN YEARS AGO: Missing child
*SATOMI: -- ?

264
0:35:01,30 --> 0:35:04,63
It's all my mother's fault.

265
0:35:09,81 --> 0:35:12,06
That's it.

266
0:35:14,06 --> 0:35:17,19
No one will come between Yuzuru-san and me.

267
0:35:17,23 --> 0:35:20,11
Not my mother... not anyone.

268
0:36:18,87 --> 0:36:21,12
{\i1}That girl.

269
0:37:48,13 --> 0:37:50,17
My grade school pictures.

270
0:37:50,21 --> 0:37:51,92
Assami-sensei.

271
0:37:51,96 --> 0:37:54,93
Satomi always sat next to me.

272
0:37:56,97 --> 0:37:59,43
She's gone!

273
0:37:59,47 --> 0:38:02,89
I'm sure she was sitting next to me!

274
0:38:08,02 --> 0:38:10,77
Satomi is... disappearing.

275
0:38:14,03 --> 0:38:16,49
That was Azusa's room.

276
0:38:44,60 --> 0:38:45,60
{\i1}Hello?

277
0:38:45,60 --> 0:38:46,43
Yuzuru-kun?

278
0:38:46,48 --> 0:38:49,52
{\i1}No time to explain. I'll be right over.


279
0:38:49,56 --> 0:38:52,52
{\i1}Lock yourself in your room and don't come out.

280
0:38:52,56 --> 0:38:53,52
Why?

281
0:38:53,57 --> 0:38:56,11
{\i1}Just do it, Satomi.

282
0:38:56,15 --> 0:38:58,32
All right.

283
0:39:10,12 --> 0:39:12,42
Yuzuru-san is mine!

284
0:39:13,88 --> 0:39:16,13
He's mine!


285
0:39:18,05 --> 0:39:20,47
Satomi? What's wrong?

286
0:40:33,16 --> 0:40:35,67
Kill her.

287
0:40:49,89 --> 0:40:51,14
Satomi!

288
0:40:53,89 --> 0:40:55,69
Satomi!

289
0:41:16,91 --> 0:41:18,42
Satomi.

290
0:41:21,17 --> 0:41:23,38
Satomi, get back.

291
0:41:26,59 --> 0:41:29,34
Yuzuru-san...

292
0:41:29,38 --> 0:41:31,47
Stay back!

293
0:41:31,51 --> 0:41:33,72
Why?

294
0:41:34,77 --> 0:41:37,02
You're not Azusa!

295
0:41:51,45 --> 0:41:54,12
Do you hate me that much?

296
0:43:00,89 --> 0:43:03,14
Yuzuru-san...

297
0:43:09,86 --> 0:43:12,07
Please, come here.

298
0:43:17,78 --> 0:43:18,87
Azusa.

299
0:43:18,87 --> 0:43:21,74
I belong to you.

300
0:43:23,20 --> 0:43:24,83
What was all that?

301
0:43:24,87 --> 0:43:28,04
Tell me you don't hate me.

302
0:43:28,08 --> 0:43:30,34
It wasn't me.

303
0:43:31,55 --> 0:43:33,80
It was them.

304
0:43:34,38 --> 0:43:36,59
It was them.

305
0:44:04,58 --> 0:44:08,04
I belong to you.

306
0:46:16,46 --> 0:46:19,13
Asleep inside your heart,

307
0:46:19,71 --> 0:46:21,96
Telepathy stirs.

308
0:46:23,26 --> 0:46:25,72
A voice only you hear,

309
0:46:26,55 --> 0:46:29,14
It calls to you in love.

310
0:46:29,18 --> 0:46:32,47
You feel it rising.

311
0:46:32,60 --> 0:46:35,89
The place where you awake is,

312
0:46:35,94 --> 0:46:38,44
A place atop the waves.

313
0:46:39,10 --> 0:46:42,57
A place that rises strangely,

314
0:46:42,61 --> 0:46:45,07
A rising dawn of blue.

315
0:46:45,86 --> 0:46:49,24
Cold, the city rises,

316
0:46:49,32 --> 0:46:51,91
A floating sea of steel,

317
0:46:52,58 --> 0:46:56,00
Why does this make me feel so,

318
0:46:56,04 --> 0:46:58,79
Alone and by myself?

319
0:46:58,83 --> 0:47:01,29
Although I want to go,

320
0:47:02,25 --> 0:47:04,92
To a place where you are,

321
0:47:05,63 --> 0:47:08,88
But I go in circles,

322
0:47:09,01 --> 0:47:13,05
Rowing with one oar.

323
0:47:13,51 --> 0:47:16,60
That day was special, too,

324
0:47:16,64 --> 0:47:19,94
You left your mark on me,

325
0:47:20,10 --> 0:47:23,19
Impacting on my heart,

326
0:47:23,27 --> 0:47:26,28
You draw a ring around,

327
0:47:26,32 --> 0:47:30,57
My heart again.

328
0:47:30,57 --> 0:47:56,22
Special thanks goes out to Blanchimont

329
0:47:56,22 --> 0:47:59,64
What kind of gifts or skills,

330
0:47:59,68 --> 0:48:02,48
Are needed to fall in love?

331
0:48:03,10 --> 0:48:06,27
I want to have you near me,

332
0:48:06,32 --> 0:48:08,86
I want to have you all.

333
0:48:09,82 --> 0:48:13,16
The way your smile lights up,

334
0:48:13,20 --> 0:48:16,33
The color of your eyes,

335
0:48:16,37 --> 0:48:19,75
I want to hear the sound of,

336
0:48:19,79 --> 0:48:22,71
The beat of your heart.

337
0:48:22,75 --> 0:48:25,46
As long as it is us,

338
0:48:26,13 --> 0:48:28,67
The future will always,

339
0:48:29,46 --> 0:48:32,47
Continue on and on,

340
0:48:32,72 --> 0:48:36,89
For all eternity.

341
0:48:37,18 --> 0:48:39,89
Always inside your heart,

342
0:48:40,56 --> 0:48:43,60
Telepathy stirs.

343
0:48:43,81 --> 0:48:46,31
A voice only you hear,

344
0:48:47,19 --> 0:48:49,27
It calls to you for love.

345
0:48:47,27 --> 0:48:49,27
