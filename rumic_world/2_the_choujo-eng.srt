He's scared to death.

10
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,330
That's disgusting!

11
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,840
Workers of the Jubei Shipping Agency!

12
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,170
You're under arrest for smuggling narcotics!

13
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,350
You did it, Maris.

14
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,820
Nothing to it, Murphy.

15
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,380
Finally, a vacation!

16
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,450
You're not wearing your restraints!

17
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,490
Damn!

18
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,790
Maris!

19
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,010
Lieutenant Maris, this is your third ship!

20
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,650
But General, I'm six times stronger than an Earthling.

21
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,520
It's your fault for giving me an Earth ship.


22
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,090
You're still responsible for the damages. Understand, Lieutenant?

Planet Oween

24
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,590
We're late! We just got the Concert tickets! Please hurry!



25
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,410
This way...

26
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,090
(Human Taxi)

27
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,030
You're looking for a Human Taxi, aren't you? AREN'T YOU?

28
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,700
I, uh...

29
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,700
Don't make her angry. She's from Thanatos!

30
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,700
The planet that blew up?

31
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,500
You're gonna hire me, right?

32
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,690
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,210
It's so hot!


34
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,440
Dammit! We finally got a vacation and I still have to work!

35
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,430
Quit complaining. How do you think I look, walking next to you?

36
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,830
Too expensive? Renting a car would have been twice as much!

37
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,100
Remember, Thanatos!


38
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,340
The breeze from 5,000 credits feels so cool!


39
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,840
Okay, let's find another victim.

40
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,480
This is so embarrassing.

41
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,290
I hate being poor!

42
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,930
Maris, phone call! It's long distance, from the planet Ahoya.

43
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,440
Hurry up!

44
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm coming.


45
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,740
They said it was important.

46
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,790
Dad, come here. It's little Maris.

47
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,290
Maris, could you lend us some money?

48
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,460
I knew it.

49
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:34,000
We're at the supermarket, and your father's restraints broke.

50
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,370
Look! See this?

51
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,270
He was drinking and didn't notice they'd broken.

52
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,930
But when he leaned on the shelf... see?

53
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,180
And?

54
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,150
Someone better pay the damages, or I'm calling the police!


55
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,480
You're the only one we can turn to.

56
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,320
What am I supposed to do?

57
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,820
If only we weren't from Thanatos.

58
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,830
Mother, you promised not to talk about Thanatos.

59
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,080
But Maris...

60
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,570
Remember this moment. Burn it into your memories.

61
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,270
Our home, our motherland! This is the end of Thanatos.


62
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,170
All right. I'll get an advance and send whatever I can.

63
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,970
Thank you Maris.


64
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,970
Sorry to bother you again.

65
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,010
But...

66
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,810
What, Maris?

67
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,280
Next time, buy better restraints. No more bargain specials.


68
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,450
No more mail order trash, either!

69
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,950
Okay, Maris.

70
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,790
Bye.

71
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,060
Goodbye!

72
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,990
So Lieutenant, how's the ride in your new ship?

73
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,490
The ride? You got taken! It's a  secondhand '62 Pippopotamus!

74
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,060
Interstellar Consumer rates it a "worst buy".



75
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,000
That explains your scowl.

76
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,000
Look who's talking.

77
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,440
Did you enjoy your vacation?

78
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,410
I had to work the whole time!

79
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,510
That explains your scowl.

80
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,680
Look who's talking.

81
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,520
Did you enjoy your vacation?

82
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,850
Hey, General...

83
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,220
Oh yes,.. your advance. It should barely cover your hotel bill.

84
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,530
Thanks.

85
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,030
Have you forgotten how I rescued you from your last job?



86
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,600
Isn't the Space Patrol better than the cruel world of Pro Wrestling?

87
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm still in debt.

88
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,040
Your next mission...

89
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,040
Why didn't you say so?

90
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,540
The son of a high official has been kidnapped.

91
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,850
The crooks are holed up on Moroi. They want a huge ransom.

92
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,110
A kidnapping?

93
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,090
The kidnappers sent us these pictures of their victim.

94
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,260
He's cheerful.




95
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,400
These were taken AFTER he was kidnapped?

96
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,400
Strangely happy, isn't he?

97
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,570
Probably because his father is a billionaire.

98
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,740
Billionaire?

99
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,950
He's Kogane Maru, son of Matsushita Sanchi.

100
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,950
Matsushita? The top of every society page in the galaxy?

101
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,220
Good luck!

102
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,130
Kogane Maru, hang on. I'm coming for you!


103
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
What are you thinking, Maris?

104
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,600
Didn't you hear, Murphy? He's the son of a billionaire!

105
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,930
You saved my life.
Please marry me.

106
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
Yup.

107
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,700
My beloved Maris!

108
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,870
Yup.

109
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,600
I slave away for a pitiful salary! I get no vacations!

110
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,370
Dad's an alcoholic and mom's an airhead!

111
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,780
And worst of all, I have to wear these STUPID restraints!

112
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,050
I hate this life!



113
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,920
Just a teensy crack. Nothing to worry about.

114
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,690
If we succeed, it's goodbye to this wretched life!

115
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Hold on, my prince!


116
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm sorry, but we're not meant for each other.

117
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,360
We come from two different worlds.

118
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,500
I want a graceful society girl...

119
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
not some cow from Thanatos!



120
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,940
You're just greedy pigs with fat thighs!

121
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,410
It would never work.

122
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,670
I hate this type!

123
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,450
Damn you! Stop using that stupid power!

124
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,120
Planet Moroi.

125
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,520
Our enemy approaches.

126
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:14,860
The fools! Sue, didn't you warn them not to contact the police?


127
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,770
Well, they're here. It's the Space Patrol Special Police.

128
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,800
Special Police? Fascinating.

129
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,340
Let's kill the hostage, as a warning.

130
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,340
Don't be a fool! We should kill the police, instead.


131
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,150
If we've got the hostage, we'll get the money.

132
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,720
Then we'll finally be able to buy a new fortress!

133
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,460
Yeah, this thing's ancient!

134
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,560
I hate this shoddy Earth junk!

135
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,390
I left a pathetic home on Bakan.

136
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,400
I've been fighting for money for five years! If only I were rich!

137
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,770
I'd finally be free of these stupid restraints!

138
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,810
Death to the Special Police!

139
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,030
I hate being poor!

140
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,990
Attack, Sue!

141
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,990
Roger!


142
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,670
God be with you.

143
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,940
I'll save you, my prince.

144
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,970
What's that?

145
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,380
Damn, they're on to me.

146
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,580
Prepare to die, Special Police Scum!

147
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,900
Vampire Maris!

148
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,140
Zombie Sue!

149
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,480
You're still alive!

150
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,420
And so deep in debt that you had to join the Special Police!


151
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,400
And you had to become a kidnapper!

152
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,320
The Special Police are just lackeys.

153
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,490
You do the Patrol's dirty work.

154
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,570
Am I wrong?

155
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,740
What was that?

156
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,970
Lackey! Lackey! Lackey!

157
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,340
Shut up you criminal!

158
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,420
Zombie Sue!

159
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,350
I can't lose!

160
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,350
I can't lose!

161
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,260
If I lose now, I'll always be poor!

162
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,260
If I lose now, I'll always be poor!

163
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,980
Bitch!

164
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,730
I'm behind her!

165
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,730
Die, kidnapper!

166
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,410
Gotcha!

167
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,520
Bye bye, Vampire Maris...

168
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,310
Forever.

169
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,170
I can't die now!

170
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,700
I trashed another ship.

171
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,480
When dawn has come,

172
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,750
I fall asleep.

173
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,020
Upon a world.

174
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,430
So strange to me.

175
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,250
Everywhere I turn.

176
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,070
Waves of sand I see.

177
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,580
I long for days.

178
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,920
When once again.

179
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,220
I'm near to you.

180
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,590
Beloved friend.

181
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,820
Please return the dream.

182
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,370
I hope stayed alive.

183
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:03,290
Entrusted to a future day.

184
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,710
Our memories are.

185
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,930
Like an oasis.

186
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,420
Each one a green

187
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,790
Lullaby.

188
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,140
In fertile grasslands.

189
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,480
Run hand in hand, and.

190
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,840
Lovers again.

191
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:36,240
Never to part, you and me.

192
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,910
Water...

193
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,750
Water!

194
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,250
Do you feel better now?

195
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,950
This is no time for jokes!

196
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,880
I've found the survivors. I'm going in for rescue.


197
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:47,180
What now? We're penniless. Do you want us to die in this gutter?

198
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,450
Shut up.

199
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,820
There it is!

200
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
There! There!

201
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,350
I've found a job!

202
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,890
What's that?


203
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,090
Look, over there! Now we can buy food!

204
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:43,180
It figures. Even out here, it was just a passing fad.

205
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,310
So you survived, Lt. Maris.

206
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,540
I'm up here.

207
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,810
General!

208
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,810
You're here?

209
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,380
I lost contact and decided to investigate.


210
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,280
Return to base for your new orders.

211
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:15,360
Planet Ahoya
Special Police Headquarters

212
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,780
Four ships, advance pay, new restraints.

213
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,510
A 30-year loan at 100,000
credits a month...

214
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,120
plus all your bonuses should cover it.

215
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,520
That leaves nothing for me!

216
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,330
Your new ship is ready. Now rescue that hostage!

217
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,590
Good luck. Maris.

218
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,080
There are two of us. What's with the huge cabin?

219
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,040
Wait, my prince.

220
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,770
Let's go. Murphy.

221
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,970
Roger.

222
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,710
Wait, Murphy, and emergency call.

223
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,550
Maris, we need a little more money.

224
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,350
But we're at the restraint store, see?

225
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,050
And?

226
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,620
Your father stopped for a few teensy drinks.

227
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,020
I had the wallet, but I looked away for a second...


228
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,370
Father, Mother, hold on.

229
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,410
I'll get rich and buy you a planet where you won't need restraints.

230
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,680
Murphy! Let's go!

231
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,580
We're here, we're here!

232
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,320
Doesn't this seem suspicious?


233
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,490
How did we slip in so easily?

234
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,520
I'll save you soon, my prince!

235
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,360
I'm yours! I'm yours!

236
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,550
WE'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR BASE!!

237
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,170
I'm all yours. Now hand over the cash!

238
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,500
What did you say?

239
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,390
That I'll never talk to you again!

240
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,640
Maris, I've always loved you!

241
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,910
Don't be an idiot!

242
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,510
Welcome to Moroi, Miss Special Police.

243
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,650
Who are you?

244
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,860
My welcoming committee is waiting outside.

245
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,620
One false move and he's dead.

246
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,900
Throw down your weapons and come out.

247
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,170
Raise your hands. Make it snappy!

248
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,800
Oh no, half the landing gear is completely ruined.

249
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,250
What's that?


250
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,090
A remote lock for your restraints.

251
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,350
Shall we go?

252
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,200
A prefab Earth base. Looks flimsy.

253
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,200
Ancient.

254
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,870
Don't underestimate it. It's efficient.

255
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,270
Yeah, right.

256
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,530
Keep moving.

257
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,480
An execution?

258
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,120
I have the perfect method.

259
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,220
I'll kill her slowly and painfully.

260
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,320
Want to watch?

261
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,090
It's no sport watching a hawk devour a sparrow.


262
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,960
If you say so.

263
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,680
Good luck.

264
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,560
So, Kogane Maru, it seems you've lost your last hope.

265
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,470
Enjoy your dinner.

266
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,070
You don't look well.

267
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,880
What do you plan to do with me?


268
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,220
With restraints on a Thanatosian is as weak as an Earthling.

269
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:10,690
I'm only strength 3. Normally, I could never beat a Thanatosian.



270
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,020
Don't interfere or you're toast.

271
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,620
It's no use. You need the control to remove them.

272
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,070
Dammit!

273
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,730
You'll die slowly.


274
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,210
No fair! What a rotten cheat!

275
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,710
I hate being poor!

276
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,570
Here I come!

277
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,080
Don't parade your poverty!

278
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,440
I'm poorer than you!

279
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,320
Damn it!

280
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,850
Time out!

281
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,070
Maris...

282
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,270
Damn it!

283
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,900
Bitch!

284
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:58,790
Which one's real? Which one's real?

285
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,480
That one!

286
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,000
The control!

287
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,820
I can't reach!

288
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,300
She'll be dead before you can get it.

289
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,610
Dammit!

290
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,290
Almost...

291
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,510
Octopuses!

292
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,580
Almost...

293
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,760
Got it!

294
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,030
Bingo!

295
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,010
It's open!

296
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,060
Wait! What are you doing?

297
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,330
Watch this, bitch!

298
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,580
Stop it! Don't break it, please!

299
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,910
Not my base! Please stop!

300
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,180
Shut up!

301
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,360
Stop!

302
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,060
You're the chief kidnapper!

303
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,430
Indeed.

304
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,330
Give me the money--

305
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,100
-- I mean the hostage!

306
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,260
I can't do that.

307
00:39:55,330 --> 00:40:00,570
We'll die with our fortress, taking all of you with us!


308
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,250
Never mind. I give up.

309
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,210
Why?

310
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,280
She wrecked my base! How can we go on?

311
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,820
Do you really want to stop? So soon?

312
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,520
That's boring.

313
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,720
Kogane Maru!

314
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,360
Are you surprised? Miss Specto Politi, uh,..

315
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,200
Police.

316
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,470
Yeah. Miss Police.

317
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,270
What? You were in league together?

318
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,070
No. I really kidnapped him, but...

319
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,580
I was so bored, so I decided to try a life of evil.

320
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,550
Only a billionaire's son could be so bold.



321
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,520
You were great. Your rescue went perfectly, Miss Special, uh...

322
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,790
Police. Maris.

323
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,360
Miss Police-Maris.

324
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,630
Yup.

325
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:10,430
My world is so poor! Everyone is poor. That's why I ran away.

326
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,370
This was my last hope. It cost so much to get this base!

327
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,220
Kogane Maru...

328
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,900
Let's go - - back to your father.




329
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,640
I even wore those stupid restraints to protect my beautiful base.

330
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,880
Don't cry.

331
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:01,650
We can make a new one. I'll give you the money.

332
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,960
Sue...

333
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,860
Don't you hate me?

334
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,320
Why? It was fun.


335
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,070
Don't cry, you'll ruin your pretty face.

336
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,210
Hey, let's get married, Sue.

337
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,480
Yup.

338
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,020
Lieutenant Maris, what happened?

339
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:39,650
If you break this one, it'll be your fifth ship!

340
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,950
I hate being poor!

341
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,540
The End.

342
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,150
The inside of your heart is like a poisoned mushroom!

343
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,860
Like a lightning bolt it flies, it's energy!

344
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:26,410
You're a perfect specimen, an Amazoness!

345
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,290
The physical beat soars through the sky!


346
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,640
This world is really built on bucks, I'd say.

347
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:40,130
Money affects everything today.

348
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,650
So, if you're happy, and you know it, too.

349
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,350
Clap your hands!

350
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,690
Poverty! Violently!

351
00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:00,230
Love is all powerful!

352
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:04,690
Poverty! Celebrity!

353
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,910
Take it all, big success!

354
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,120
Heaven and Hell are divided by a road of money!


355
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,850
Coins jingle jingle a merry sound, marry for money!

356
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,420
In a pinch some money would be as good.

357
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:33,140
It's the chance to dance, I know you will take!



358
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,400
All men are boys with the bucks, I'd say.

359
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,240
Their bodies gleam, credit charged, you know!

360
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,780
Super greedy with incredible,

361
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,450
Sexy Power!

362
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,330
Poverty! Violently!

363
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:01,840
The future will be like that!

364
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,630
Poverty! Celebrity!


365
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,890
Fiery good success!


366
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,280
This world is really built on bucks, I'd say.

367
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,860
It's easy living in a broken dream.
