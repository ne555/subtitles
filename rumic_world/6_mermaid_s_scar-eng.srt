1
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,724
Ever since the beginning of time

2
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,724
People have said that

3
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,024
the mermaid flesh is
the elixir of immortality

4
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:02,261
Those who taste it

5
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:06,167
are said to be given eternal life

6
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:19,141
Mermaid's Scar

7
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:13,637
Come

8
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,570
Wow, it's pretty heavy

9
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,774
Are you okay?

10
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:28,847
You're alone?

11
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,477
Where are you from?

12
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:32,180
Tokyo

13
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:35,926
Did you hear that, Mana?

14
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:39,258
This kid came all the way from Tokyo


15
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,438
So... you're here to see your mom

16
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,975
We're gonna live together from now on

17
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:02,986
Is she here to pick to up?

18
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,589
Look, it's mommy

19
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,500
Mommy?

20
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:44,957
How old are you?

21
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:46,291
20

22
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,228
Really?

23
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,198
And that girl over there?

24
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:55,068
She's my sister

25
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,632
Sister...?

26
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,108
Well, who cares

27
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,907
We're short on people anyway

28
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:09,913
They don't look like bad people

29
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,579
True

30
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,452
Get changed then

31
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:15,958
You're free to use the room inside

32
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,389
Thank you

33
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,744
They said they're resting



34
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:48,315
What... why are you laughing?

35
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,394
Nothing...

36
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,891
Hi

37
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:00,764
I heard you're going to work
at the mansion

38
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:02,100
Yes

39
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,268
What for?

40
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:06,539
The madam's boy

41
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:10,512
They're gonna live together
from now on

42
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:13,606
Mommy

43
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:33,057
Good morning

44
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,761
It's you, Yukie

45
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:38,096
Good morning, sir

46
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:39,362
You're early

47
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:41,699
I just woke up

48
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:44,668
I'll go and make breakfast now

49
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:52,006
Good morning, madam

50
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,483
Good morning

51
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:02,552
Come here, Masato

52
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:29,347
You're not a princess, you know...

53
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:32,217
You've never poured tea before?

54
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:36,318
Sorry, she's new. She didn't know

55
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,826
Getting upset just like that

56
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,294
Hey

57
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:41,163
Madam

58
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,630
It's Yukie




59
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,564
I'm on my way to get some grocery
I thought I'd stop by

60
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,229
and relax a bit


61
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:49,863
That kid...

62
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,407
Is he the young master of the house?

63
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,477
Yes

64
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,544
Am I disliked?

65
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,310
Nonsense

66
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:04,678
You're just nervous, that's all

67
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:12,553
Kids take to you easily

68
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:15,689
But it hasn't even been a week...

69
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:18,400
It's just a coincidence

70
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:20,766
Yuta... that boy

71
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,228
That time

72
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:23,898
How... did we meet?

73
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:27,671
Remember? We met in the metro...

74
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:31,142
Didn't you say
you're here to see your mom?

75
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:36,150
Well... how's it been?

76
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:47,430
Really... he's already
getting attached to Yukie

77
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:52,928
I hear he doesn't talk much
with the madam

78
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:56,199
Yukie seems worried

79
00:08:56,341 --> 00:09:00,368
There are some strange rumors
about the missus

80
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:07,144
The master married her in old age

81
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:11,381
I heard that she wasn't here
before the accident

82
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:12,785
The accident?

83
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:14,050
Yes... yes

84
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,285
It's quite a strange rumor

85
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:19,795
A month ago,
the couple were on a yacht

86
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:22,900
when it collided with
a speed boat and exploded

87
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,763
The master and the other man
died instantaneously

88
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:27,838
The missus died of severe burns,

89
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,873
but she came back to life the next day

90
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:34,745
Came back to life

91
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:42,276
And vanished from the hospital

92
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,581
When she returned a week later

93
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:46,588
she has completely
healed from her wounds

94
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:49,057
But she was severely burned

95
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:52,391
I've never heard of anyone
healing from that in a week's time

96
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,091
And so the rumor spread



97
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:01,604
Masato, the meal is ready

98
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,140
Can you get the madam?

99
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,485
The scar is gone



100
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,176
Where have you been hiding?



101
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:44,907
I don't know... I don't know

102
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,882
No... madame

103
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:18,943
What's going on?

104
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,385
It's healed

105
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,962
It's not as worse as I thought

106
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:34,725
You're Yuta, right?

107
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,731
Thank God you're here

108
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,096
Where's madam?

109
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:40,761
She's calming down

110
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:42,600
What should we do?
Should we call the police or...

111
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,105
No

112
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:48,506
I don't want them to take my mom

113
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,979
Please don't tell others
what happened here today

114
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,720
Wait

115
00:11:58,189 --> 00:11:59,816
I'll go talk to madam

116
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,721
I'll tell her not to abuse little kids

117
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,981
The scar is gone

118
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:38,289
Yeah... good as new, huh?

119
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,354
I've lived 500 years

120
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:41,897
How old are you?

121
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,194
How do you know about me?

122
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:47,133
I heard about the accident

123
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:50,173
Your burn healed right away
and you came back to life

124
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:52,909
Me too

125
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,342
My external wounds heal quickly

126
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,643
Even if I die, I'd come back to life
in half a day's time

127
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:00,683
Just as long
my head doesn't get cut off

128
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:02,843
I'll go on living

129
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:07,952
You've eaten...
the mermaid flesh too, right?

130
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,531
Yukie

131
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,633
Yuta, you're not gonna
fight with mom, are you?

132
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:25,004
It'll be okay

133
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:27,202
Go take a look

134
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:30,473
Then I'll go prepare some drinks

135
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,082
Wait

136
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:40,123
Just like the Happyaku Bikuni
(the 800-year-old Buddhist nun) said

137
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:42,348
Those who eat the mermaid flesh

138
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,961
will not age and will not die

139
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:48,327
For decades... centuries

140
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,991
So everyone who eats it will...

141
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:54,104
No... the mermaid flesh
is a very powerful drug

142
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,729
In other words, it's poison

143
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:58,865
It will completely alter
your body structure

144
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,001
Those people who can stand
this sudden change

145
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:03,010
and become immortals are rare

146
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:06,913
One appears in decades...
no, in a couple of centuries...

147
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:11,017
I've lived 500 years all alone

148
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:12,486
Those people who have eaten it,
besides me,

149
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:15,354
either died or turned into monsters

150
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:17,825
Mon... sters

151
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,487
Instead of turning into immortals

152
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:21,997
You didn't know?

153
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:25,432
You will look and feel like a monster

154
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,094
No longer human

155
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:29,172
but beasts

156
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:31,832
If this is true

157
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:33,944
So?

158
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:38,179
Mom

159
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,785
You're still mad at me?

160
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:51,691
Next time we'll talk
when the boy's not around

161
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,893
Are you gonna be okay by yourself?

162
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,969
Do you want to come?
Even though it's only a shack

163
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:03,837
It's okay

164
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,551
That boy
We have to do something for him

165
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:18,349
It's seven

166
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:20,988
Do you have a date?

167
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,387
Yes

168
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:26,192
Well... thank you for today

169
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:47,513
The mermaid's flesh is poisonous?

170
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:50,780
Not everyone become immortals?

171
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,986
So will I die one day?

172
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,756
We have to hurry

173
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:01,660
We have to fiind the mermaid flesh soon

174
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:15,003
Yuta

175
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:18,081
Yukie

176
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:20,548
I came to see you
before going up to the house

177
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:22,846
I'm sorry about yesterday

178
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:25,615
It's nothing

179
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:29,818
It's nothing to worry about

180
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:34,194
Mana

181
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,425
Yuta, look

182
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:39,568
It's pretty, huh?

183
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:44,003
So... last night...

184
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,541
You're getting married

185
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:48,906
Yes

186
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:52,140
We have discussed this

187
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:54,148
That's wonderful

188
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,277
But...

189
00:16:58,055 --> 00:16:59,283
Masato?

190
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:00,356
Yes

191
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:02,322
I'm sorry about Masato

192
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,020
It seems like I'm running away

193
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,654
You're very kind

194
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,597
You'll be a great wife

195
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,739
Thank you

196
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:19,704
Well, then... goodbye

197
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:30,247
Is that your friend?

198
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:31,912
Yes

199
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:36,390
But you don't seem happy to see him

200
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,825
Doesn't seem long-lived to me

201
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:40,555
Are you taking him?

202
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:43,166
I don't feel like it

203
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:47,670
But I can't just abandon him

204
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,303
So... you're getting married

205
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,103
But that's wonderful

206
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,404
Congratulations

207
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,979
Thank you

208
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,847
Masato

209
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:04,477
I'll go see

210
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:15,765
Masato

211
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:23,004
Are you leaving us?

212
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:26,471
Not right away

213
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,473
But I will

214
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,412
I'm sorry

215
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,951
Honestly, I wanted to stay longer

216
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:38,385
Yukie

217
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,286
That...

218
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,721
Try this

219
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:47,862
What is it?

220
00:18:54,238 --> 00:18:56,399
Thank you

221
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:10,916
Let's go

222
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,310
Masato

223
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:48,852
Monster

224
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,627
Run

225
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:11,747
Mana

226
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,474
Take the kid and run

227
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,676
Hurry

228
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,493
You can't escape

229
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:27,728
What are you doing?

230
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:41,836
Wait

231
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:49,446
You wait right here

232
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,248
I'm going back

233
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:53,789
You're hurt

234
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,086
It's no big deal

235
00:20:58,362 --> 00:20:59,693
Yukie

236
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:18,866
Yukie

237
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:23,313
Hey, what's going on?

238
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:26,439
Answer me... why did you turn Yukie...

239
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:28,848
It's him

240
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:31,181
He did it

241
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:36,148
He wanted to fiind someone
to replace me

242
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:38,519
Masato

243
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:49,933
Where are you going?

244
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:51,564
Almost

245
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:56,636
How come you have the poison
that kills monsters?

246
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:01,682
Over there

247
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:13,922
My hideout

248
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,095
Where's the poison?

249
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:25,471
Are your friend and my mom both dead?

250
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,840
What are you saying?

251
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:28,569
Give me the poison

252
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:34,306
Your... wound has healed

253
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:43,419
This is a stun gun

254
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,893
Did you know that?

255
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,901
Mana

256
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,008
Mana

257
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:02,136
Mana

258
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:04,974
Yuta

259
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:09,779
Yuta

260
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,952
He's... an obstacle

261
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,864
Where did he go?

262
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:26,730
I first met Masato

263
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:29,499
a long long time ago

264
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,541
at the time of the Pacific War


265
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:35,702
The day of the Tokyo Air Raid

266
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:40,845
My husband died in the war

267
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:45,615
And one night, my only son

268
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:49,089
was killed by a fallen beam

269
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:52,523
I had lost all will to live

270
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:54,654
And then...

271
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:05,931
Madam

272
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,209
This...

273
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,613
Taste it

274
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:17,081
He has been with me ever since then

275
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:20,622
At first I believed my son
had come back to life

276
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,055
I was very happy

277
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:25,593
But years passed and he would not age

278
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:27,458
Neither did I

279
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:30,465
Wounds would heal instantly

280
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:32,898
Mermaid flesh

281
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:36,532
He said he ate it long ago

282
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:38,938
and then gave some to me

283
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:41,169
I slowly realized his cruelty

284
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:43,280
But even if I killed him,
he would still come back

285
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:46,076
I can only run... keep on running

286
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:49,244
Then the master here saved me

287
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:51,377
That was five years ago

288
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:54,488
Hey

289
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:57,717
I don't know if it was the news
about the boat accident

290
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,385
that brought him here

291
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,498
So I gave up

292
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:04,032
I knew I couldn't escape from him

293
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:05,829
But...

294
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,271
What is it... are you okay?

295
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,701
Lf... we don't get...

296
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:14,834
We have to get the mermaid flesh
from him quick

297
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,807
It's healing too slow

298
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:29,356
Doesn't it hurt?

299
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:33,190
Eating the mermaid flesh
won't necessarily stop the pain

300
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,592
Let me go

301
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,359
I can't

302
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,230
If I let you go you'll go back to him

303
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,803
Of course

304
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:41,962
No

305
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:44,370
You have to be with me

306
00:26:44,508 --> 00:26:47,534
I don't want to be with you

307
00:26:48,312 --> 00:26:51,008
That woman is fimished

308
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:52,775
I have to fiind a replacement

309
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:53,814
Shut up

310
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:56,249
I'm going back to Yuta

311
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:57,945
Take this off

312
00:26:58,088 --> 00:27:00,613
Damn it! Take it off

313
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,289
Yuta

314
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:08,956
Well... I'll go kill Yuta then

315
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:14,063
I will bring back Yuta's head

316
00:27:14,204 --> 00:27:16,468
If I cut off his head he'll die

317
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,132
You'll give up when he's gone

318
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:21,642
You... what do you want?

319
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:26,578
Mana... you're gonna have to
live with me from now on

320
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:38,152
Hey... hold on...

321
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:43,731
Hey... get up

322
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,164
It's no use

323
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,096
She... her healing power has weakened

324
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:54,711
It seems that the mermaid flesh
is not very effective

325
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:57,609
It's taking longer for me
to come back to life

326
00:27:57,748 --> 00:27:59,545
Slowly... I'll die...

327
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:01,810
And Mana

328
00:28:01,952 --> 00:28:03,214
It's very difficult to survive
on your own

329
00:28:03,353 --> 00:28:05,287
in a kid's body

330
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:07,117
Mana is gonna live with me

331
00:28:07,257 --> 00:28:09,225
She has no use for me now

332
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,293
I will cut off her head later

333
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:13,786
You...

334
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:25,736
Stop

335
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,181
The piano thread

336
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:41,518
What a shame

337
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:45,626
It looks like the decapitation
won't work

338
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,739
It's true

339
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,604
I saved it

340
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:01,768
during the war

341
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:03,573
You...

342
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:04,909
You're gonna...

343
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,242
If I let you live

344
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:08,351
Mana will run away

345
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,646
just like that woman

346
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:13,383
What are you saying?

347
00:29:18,328 --> 00:29:20,796
Just let you give the mermaid flesh
to anyone you like?

348
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:24,059
You know what it is
and you still let people eat it?

349
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:27,635
I've lived 500 years all alone

350
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:30,035
It has been 500 years...
before I met Mana

351
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:31,801
The loneliness

352
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:35,207
The pain of immortality
is more than I can bare

353
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:37,142
That's why I can't forgive you

354
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:40,375
How many people did you give it to?

355
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:45,081
Kill me then

356
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:06,069
How naive you are

357
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,701
You haven't had enough of it, huh?

358
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:11,143
You...

359
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:14,808
I don't remember how many,

360
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:19,787
because I have lived in this form
for 800 years

361
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:24,553
I don't have to listen to you
You're just bigger than me, that's all

362
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:26,720
800 years...

363
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:33,025
Who was the first one
to offer the mermaid flesh?

364
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:39,633
Mother... try it

365
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:40,936
That's...

366
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:42,409
It's mermaid flesh...

367
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:45,014
I heard it's the elixir of immortality

368
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:46,410
It's good

369
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,144
Come on... have a bite, mother

370
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,840
Was that my mother?

371
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:18,040
I don't remember

372
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:20,612
You have been through it all

373
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:23,515
You know about the monsters...

374
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:25,781
and you still...

375
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,819
I was alone for the first 100 years

376
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,861
But those who adopted me

377
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:37,456
either died of war, famine or disease

378
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,364
When I got tired of death

379
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:42,734
I remembered the mermaid flesh

380
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:46,866
Since there aren't anyone like me
I'll make some

381
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:51,109
I had all the time in the world

382
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:54,183
I thought if I kept looking
I'll fiind one one day

383
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:56,479
I gave it to many people

384
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,249
That woman lasted the longest

385
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,950
She was a nice person too
in the beginning

386
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:06,460
She gave me the name Masato

387
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:10,622
So you dumped her
when she served no more purpose

388
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:14,259
Then I gave it to Yukie...

389
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:19,398
Didn't she always look out for you?

390
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:21,409
I'm sorry

391
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:24,673
I wanted to stay longer

392
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,680
She...

393
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:32,346
You really think that it's okay
if Yukie dies or turns into a monster?

394
00:32:35,726 --> 00:32:37,455
People like us

395
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:40,062
It would be a burden

396
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:42,631
if we were to keep on liking people

397
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,108
Release me!

398
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:28,869
Hurry

399
00:33:29,012 --> 00:33:30,377
We don't have all day

400
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:31,939
Yes

401
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:40,817
I will not forgive... that boy

402
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,019
Don't move

403
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:02,304
Just one more shot

404
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:20,320
What endurance

405
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:21,658
Why did you run?

406
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:24,164
Were you afraid to die?

407
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:28,003
Haven't you lived for 500 years?

408
00:34:28,138 --> 00:34:30,470
You still can't let go of the world?

409
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:43,118
Mana

410
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:03,199
Yuta

411
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:10,503
Yuta

412
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:12,537
You...

413
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:18,345
Stay put

414
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:34,561
Yuta

415
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:54,456
Just you try

416
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:57,116
I'll kill you if you kill him

417
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,720
I will hunt your head down to
the end of the world if it kills me

418
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,805
Yuta's gone. That's the only way

419
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:29,492
Bad woman

420
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:47,170
Hey... I've decided to let you
live longer

421
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:54,082
Hey... wake up... hey

422
00:37:01,124 --> 00:37:03,558
Dead, huh?

423
00:37:31,955 --> 00:37:34,423
I still have the mermaid flesh

424
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:36,787
If you're still alive... goodbye

425
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:38,416
Goodbye

426
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:40,562
Wait

427
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:17,255
Yuta

428
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:00,637
Mana

429
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:06,673
Yuta

430
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:10,749
Where is he?

431
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:14,082
He ran off with the mermaid flesh

432
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:15,748
Find him

433
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:06,971
I'll do that when I come back to life

434
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:39,636
Is he dead?

435
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,144
If the fire burned clean

436
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:45,278
The mermaid flesh too?

437
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,214
I don't know...

438
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:03,622
Mana

439
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:09,200
You... did you cry when I came back?

440
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:10,806
Yes

441
00:41:11,341 --> 00:41:12,603
Were you afraid?

442
00:41:12,742 --> 00:41:13,970
Stupid

443
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:19,013
No... it was the first time I saw you cry

444
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:22,242
It was my first time

445
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:27,089
When I think
that Yuta is still alive...

446
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:30,556
When I think
that I can still be with him

447
00:41:30,693 --> 00:41:33,457
I was so happy I cried

448
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:44,000
People like us

449
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,506
If would be a burden

450
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:48,941
if we keep on liking people

451
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,676
Nonsense

452
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:54,009
Yuta
