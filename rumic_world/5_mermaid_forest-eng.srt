1
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,549
Come on. Come on

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,922
This is the #1 comedy in the country

3
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,756
The most hilarious comedy

4
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:30,920
Come, come...

5
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,158
Is it really funny?

6
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,292
Come see for yourself

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,533
Come, young man

8
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,536
As your present
to the world of the dead

9
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,970
Watch the movie

10
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,771
A present to the world of the dead

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,279
Yes, it's so funny that you'll still
be laughing after you die

12
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,841
Well, it's not my business then

13
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,148
What?

14
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,880
You...

15
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,512
You egoist. I'll never...

16
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,586
Hey

17
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,259
Are you a kidnapper?

18
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,897
No

19
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,366
What are you looking for?

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,567
I'm looking for someone

21
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,036
Who?

22
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,232
I don't know

23
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,070
What? I'm taking you to the police

24
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,973
Why?

25
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,137
Just do as I say

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,306
Extra! Extra! Important news!

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,213
Extra! Extra!

28
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,085
Stop moving around

29
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,381
What are you?

30
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,219
No, officer, I'm sorry. I'm sorry

31
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,384
Stop! Stop!

32
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,181
There must be someone like me

33
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,816
somewhere out there

34
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,401
Stop or I'll shoot!

35
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,204
What are you saying? We can't wait

36
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,971
Ready

37
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,546
Fire



38
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,387
What's going on?

39
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,567
He's dead

40
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:41,713
(The Noto Peninsula The Kannagi House)


41
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:57,199
Soldiers, the sons of the emperor

42
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,795
It's not too late

43
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,238
Turn yourselves in

44
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:08,837
Those who resist will...

45
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,814
The snow is getting bigger

46
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,221
Yeah

47
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,689
Will my sister make it through winter?

48
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,953
Not with the current technology

49
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,757
Don't say that. Please help her

50
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,455
I've done all I could

51
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,760
But...

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,450
Sawa

53
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,786
What is it? Why the look?

54
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,393
Help me up

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm not gonna make it

56
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,431
I won't see spring...

57
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,165
It's warm now

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,368
Towa

59
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,604
You are the other me,

60
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,941
so you cannot die

61
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,376
But...

62
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,847
This is the medicine of the mermaid

63
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,581
Don't tell dad

64
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,454
No medicine will...

65
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,420
It's the blood of the mermaid

66
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,656
What?

67
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,429
The flesh of a mermaid
will make you immortal

68
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,367
It'll work

69
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,504
Come on, drink it

70
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,330
Get rid of the body

71
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,165
Yes

72
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,580
No, it can't be...

73
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,315
He is dead, right?

74
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,160
My body...

75
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,468
Help...

76
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,989
Miss Towa

77
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,818
Doc... Doctor...

78
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,085
My body is burning up

79
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,991
My body is burning up

80
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,494
Miss Sawa, what did you give her?

81
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,205
Mermaid's blood

82
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,907
Shiro

83
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,378
Shiro

84
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:07,839
Really? It died a long time ago

85
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,213
You run into a lot things in 500 years

86
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,952
Aren't you tired?

87
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,353
Coming back over and over again

88
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,052
I don't like it either

89
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,171
Is that a cat?

90
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,143
Yes

91
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,510
Is it alone too?

92
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,007
Maybe

93
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,484
Do you want to take it?

94
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,920
No, it's gonna die soon

95
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,957
It won't come back?

96
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,025
No

97
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,992
Just like that

98
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,120
Can I play with it?

99
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,165
Just for a little while

100
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,515
Where are you going, kitty?

101
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,293
Mana

102
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,084
I heard my friend was brought here

103
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,021
If you're talking about that girl,
she has a minor concussion

104
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,617
I tried to stop her, but she left

105
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,390
What's her name? I don't know

106
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,966
She didn't say


107
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,229
It's time for work

108
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,654
Who's sick?

109
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,057
The survivors of the Kannagi House

110
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,254
There's only that 70ish old lady there

111
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,181
The doctor is the only person
who has entered

112
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
the Kanngi House in all these years

113
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,459
It looks like it's gonna rain
cats and dogs

114
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,490
She looks like she's still alive

115
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,565
She feel from the cliff

116
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,998
Died instantaneously

117
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,769
This is the freshest body we have now

118
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,412
Ever since then, every three years...

119
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,751
I don't know how many I've had

120
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,903
I don't know
how long I have to keep on doing this

121
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,234
Sawa

122
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,842
Until you find the mermaid

123
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,140
So...

124
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,013
It's somewhere in this house, right?

125
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,350
No

126
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,819
No such thing

127
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,382
It's none of your business

128
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,429
My hand is killing me

129
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:30,295
Okay, doctor, quick

130
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,940
She's moving

131
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,670
How?

132
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,150
She's alive

133
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,054
But she's dead

134
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,341
Where am I?

135
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,289
The legend of the mermaid is true

136
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,743
Strange. I smell dead bodies

137
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,909
Shiro...

138
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,917
Still can't find it?

139
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,545
My hand... hurts

140
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,018
It hurts...

141
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,865
Shiro, find it quick

142
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,031
Find the Mermaid Hill
where the mermaid is buried

143
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,039
Mermaid

144
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,905
Who is it?

145
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,476
I'm looking for my friend

146
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,676
You're a friend of that girl's?

147
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,949
She's here, right?

148
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,191
Answer me

149
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,256
She's here, right?

150
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,332
Where's Mana?

151
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,579
Towa

152
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,479
Towa

153
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,746
Shiro, go back

154
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,287
What are you doing here?

155
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,958
How cruel

156
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,962
I'm sure they're dead

157
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,396
Towa, you...

158
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,836
How

159
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,964
You were attacked by a mink, right?






160
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,841
I don't want to do this anymore

161
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:44,321
You're cutting up corpses again

162
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,818
Why? For her

163
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,424
I love her

164
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,264
I have loved her for 55 years

165
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,892
One more

166
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,464
Is it okay to eat that much?

167
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,328
What's wrong with that?

168
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,702
Everybody admires you

169
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,038
Your lovely young body

170
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,219
Your thoughts haven't aged

171
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,253
No... no



172
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,355
I don't know how to say it

173
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,793
Coming back to life is...

174
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,024
It's more than extraordinary

175
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,724
I'm not an object on display

176
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,802
Stop staring

177
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,397
I'm jealous of you

178
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,735
Right, Sawa?

179
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,111
So, you're an orphan?

180
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,217
Yes

181
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,184
Then stay here

182
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,653
You can be my sister

183
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,718
No, I can't

184
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,417
Yuta is waiting for me

185
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,825
He's looking for me, I know it

186
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,862
Really?

187
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,127
Then he will come here?

188
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,260
I guess

189
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,396
Well, stay here until then

190
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,368
Okay

191
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,503
Because I'm lonely

192
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,306
There's just me and the old man

193
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,047
Me too. Just me and Yuta

194
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,775
But I'm not lonely at all

195
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,320
Yuta, is he your boyfriend?

196
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,349
No, just a friend

197
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,585
A friend

198
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,496
Yes, a friend

199
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,431
There...

200
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,200
It looks like blood

201
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,310
What is it?

202
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,654
Look for a body...

203
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,220
Do you have a fever?

204
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,162
I know I won't live
much longer like this

205
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,027
You're gonna die?

206
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,361
Worse

207
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:50,531
I will go to hell

208
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,111
The dream...

209
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,779
Towa, what's wrong?

210
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,113
Come in, please

211
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,923
I had that dream again

212
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,631
It's all because of my incompetence...

213
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,031
No, doctor, it's not your fault

214
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,039
Come

215
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:40,344
That girl
ate the mermaid's flesh, right?

216
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,851
I can only say it's a miracle

217
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,956
Eternal life

218
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,354
It really is possible

219
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,590
It hurts

220
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,201
Do something, doctor


221
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,496
I will give you something
to stop the pain

222
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,934
No

223
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,775
It won't work

224
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,939
It really hurts. Please do something

225
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:15,644
Monster
I don't want to turn into a monster

226
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,020
Switch hands with that girl

227
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,220
I can't do it

228
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,491
I can't do it. Cutting the girl up

229
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,601
Really?

230
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,730
I'm not like the sun

231
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,862
The morning comes after the night

232
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,031
Coming back to life after death

233
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,881
Mermaids aren't real

234
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,186
No! My grandpa saw it too

235
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,727
Eat it and you'll be immortal

236
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,921
Really?

237
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,965
All I know is that
it's the elixir of eternal life

238
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,433
What is it, Yuta?

239
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,299
You're unhappy

240
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,099
Things aren't going my way

241
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,902
I might become an immortal

242
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:51,448
I think there are some things
that humans aren't supposed to touch

243
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,930
I see it

244
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,065
What? It's good. Eat it

245
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,091
What is it?

246
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,257
It's poisonous

247
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:52,656
Shiro, are you hungry?

248
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,197
Sorry, I'm late

249
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,863
Eat, Shiro

250
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,470
The unrealized one

251
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,014
Cute Shiro

252
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,884
Only you understand me

253
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,423
You look the way you do,
because you have licked

254
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,993
the mermaid's blood
for the last 55 years

255
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,993
Of course


256
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,795
I knew he wasn't any ordinary dog

257
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,333
You've come back to life

258
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,131
That's how my body works

259
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,540
You ate the mermaid's flesh, right?

260
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,307
Where's my friend?

261
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,915
Where's Mana?

262
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,520
She's taking a bath right now

263
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,414
What do you mean?

264
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,494
Even as an immortal,

265
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:34,530
you will die if you're decapitated

266
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,066
Is that true?
What?

267
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,726
What are you doing?

268
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,200
Stop bothering me

269
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,506
Shiro, decapitate him

270
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,777
Eat him

271
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,754
Wait

272
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,694
Don't touch her

273
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,138
Let me help you

274
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,639
That's okay

275
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,904
No need to be polite





276
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:00,474
It's hard to do with just one hand
Please forgive me

277
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,091
I'll leave tomorrow

278
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:13,959
Why?

279
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,690
I'm gonna look for Yuta

280
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,892
He must be worried

281
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,732
Really?

282
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,099
Yuta

283
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,292
You'll see him soon enough

284
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,903
Really?

285
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:53,935
Yeah

286
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,768
So, just enjoy the bath

287
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,467
What beautiful skin

288
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,243
Flawless

289
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,626
You're the one

290
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,253
Switch the heads

291
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,291
Yes

292
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,261
Switch my head with hers

293
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,796
Fool

294
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,559
Just switching hands

295
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,136
Three years
and it's already like this

296
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,105
And... your body is getting
weaker and weaker

297
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,972
One day your entire body
will be like your hand

298
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,170
I'm sure...

299
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,837
It won't

300
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,414
Liar

301
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:52,118
Doctor, you have done a lot
for me in these 55 years

302
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,652
Why?

303
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,955
Because...

304
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,827
I... you...

305
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,103
Then you will do it

306
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,603
About switching heads...

307
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,505
So I can get eternal life

308
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,379
Sawa

309
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,579
I know you're there

310
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,747
Come on out

311
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,923
Please don't do this

312
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,823
Doctor, Towa

313
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,986
Why?

314
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,257
That guy is still alive?

315
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,367
Why kill innocent people?

316
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,936
How can you say that?

317
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,603
Come, Dr. Shina

318
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,438
What is this?

319
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,240
You and me

320
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,439
Don't you think we're alike?

321
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,380
But God has been unfair

322
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,816
I've been cursed

323
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:34,323
while you sparkle of life

324
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,519
I will get your body

325
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,064
and live forever

326
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,499
Wait, sis

327
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,166
I will take you to the Mermaid Hill

328
00:36:55,713 --> 00:37:00,047
Really? Finally

329
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,123
It stinks

330
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,691
What a disgusting smell

331
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,351
Come on, let's go down

332
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,059
What's that noise?

333
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:55,002
It means that no one will come for you

334
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,106
It's the mermaid

335
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,109
I heard that my great-grandfather
caught one 100 years ago

336
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,576
and hid it here

337
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:41,276
You will be immortal after
you eat its flesh, like this girl

338
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,853
Is that right, Sawa?

339
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,252
That's why you wanted to cure me

340
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,120
and made me drank the blood

341
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,033
No

342
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:09,577
Towa

343
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,341
Sis

344
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:18,116
Come, get the mermaid's flesh for me

345
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,886
What are you doing?

346
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,091
What if you get hurt?

347
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,238
What is that?

348
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,313
That

349
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,314
You must know

350
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,350
as the owner of the Mermaid Hill

351
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,681
Answer me, Sawa

352
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,290
The unrealized one

353
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,659
What about Shiro?

354
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,191
Even though it's kind of sad, but...

355
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,968
The mermaid's flesh is poisonous

356
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:19,378
Those who eat it either die or...

357
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,180
They might turn out like Shiro, right?

358
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:33,955
Mana

359
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,429
Yuta

360
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,284
Come here, Mana

361
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,580
Yuta

362
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,754
Thanks to you

363
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,383
I finally have the mermaid flesh

364
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,327
Stop

365
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,970
Towa

366
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,511
Still alive

367
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:09,686
Still alive after all this

368
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,125
Like me

369
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,035
Don't eat it

370
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,342
Eat it, Sawa

371
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,746
Come, I have been searching for
the mermaid flesh all this time

372
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,950
just for you

373
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,690
What's going on?

374
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,993
You're the one

375
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,762
who wants to be an immortal

376
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,154
The mermaid's flesh does exist, right?

377
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,388
I don't know

378
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,264
I think it does

379
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,662
I want to eat it

380
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,602
No matter what

381
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,077
Why do you want to eat it?

382
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,042
Because I don't want be
beaten by Towa

383
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,443
What?

384
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:43,520
Because I want to retain
youth and beauty

385
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,924
What is it?

386
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:02,562
But you know
that the unrealized one is...

387
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:09,745
My great-grandfather
who ate the mermaid flesh

388
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,547
So I used my sister's body to test
the effects of the mermaid blood

389
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,882
How... how can that be?

390
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,622
Right, Towa?

391
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,696
Because we are twins

392
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,993
We are one

393
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,770
You'll marry

394
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,537
Have babies, nurse them

395
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,513
and live like ordinary women

396
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:26,054
And then you will age and die

397
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,218
How can I let you die?

398
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,194
Come, eat up

399
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,290
I'll turn into a monster

400
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:40,529
Or you will continue living in an old,
used up body





401
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,498
Come

402
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,094
It's acute arrythmia

403
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,474
Not fair

404
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,341
Towa

405
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,575
Stop it

406
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,249
Towa

407
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:40,626
For this day,
I have lived to see this day

408
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,592
Dr. Shina, burn it

409
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,295
Burn the Mermaid Hill

410
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,119
Burn it all

411
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,855
Let all the hateful memories...

412
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,392
But I don't even have someone
to blame it on

413
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:18,731
How lonely

414
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,598
No such thing

415
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,331
I've always...

416
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,239
Goodbye, doctor

417
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,179
Towa
No

418
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,478
Towa

419
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:43,353
Recapture the 55 years
that you have lost

420
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,153
Towa

421
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:24,456
Did the fire reach the Kannagi House?

422
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,795
Yeah

423
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:30,032
Maybe it's connected to
the Mermaid Hill somehow

424
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,142
What is death like?




425
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:40,377
It's when the chain
that binds human life is released

426
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,510
Chain?

427
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,179
Hate

428
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:47,783
Betrayal

429
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,256
Revenge

430
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,385
But I'm not bound by anything

431
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,591
You're special

432
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,756
What do you mean?

433
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,427
You have absolute freedom

434
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,298
A shooting star

435
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,070
That

436
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,646
Return to the Mermaid Forest
in the depth of the sea

437
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:47,374
Those lost souls have returned to...

438
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,975
The permanent place?

439
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,850
Yes, the permanent place

440
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,892
Yuta

441
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,694
How long is permanent?

442
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:08,635
Didn't you say,
for as long as time goes on?

443
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,263
Forever and ever and ever?

444
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,966
Yeah

445
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,203
Even when the human race disappears?

446
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,779
Yes

447
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,150
And Yuta and I will live on?

448
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,945
Probably

449
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,577
Just the two of us?

450
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,549
Yuta

451
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,993
Does alone mean lonely?

452
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:40,095
Let's say if I've disappeared
What will you do?

453
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,706
Search

454
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,040
And if you can't find me?

455
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,405
I will look harder

456
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,739
So, you'll...


457
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,438
Always search

458
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,848
Always looking

459
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:00,388
For my entire life
No, forever and ever

460
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,783
For eternity

461
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,622
Thanks

462
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:22,105
Now the wind has stopped whispering

463
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:34,554
"Don't let go of the hand"

464
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:47,301
Why does my heart ache?

465
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:59,372
What is it trying to say?

466
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:05,911
The gloomy night

467
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,652
The blue skies

468
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:21,303
Now I am looking at you,

469
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:26,671
the person who told me everything

470
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:33,672
Traveling so we may reunite one day

471
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:38,982
In this hand

472
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:46,151
I am reborn for love

473
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:51,859
It made me realize...

474
00:52:53,703 --> 00:53:08,744
For the first time I want
to believe the word "forever"

475
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:17,119
I won't let go this time
I just want to stay here

476
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,527
That's all

477
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,233
I won't be afraid

478
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:35,209
just as long you're here

479
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:42,249
Traveling so we may reunite one day

480
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:47,721
In this hand

481
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:54,627
I am reborn for love

482
00:53:54,965 --> 00:54:01,803
It made me realize...
